which took the first premium at our county fair.I have been offered $15 a
bushel for my seed, but would not part with a handful of it.If I could
not get more like it, I would not sell the three bushels I raised from the
quart for $100.STEABNER, Sorlien's Mill, Yellow Medicine Co., Minn.Farmers, if you want to know more of this wheat, write to

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Prairie Farmer, Vol.Bert took
no part in these proceedings, and at first rather disapproved of them
because he was afraid there would be trouble when Misery came, but when
the fire was an accomplished fact he warmed his hands and shifted his
work to the other side of the bench so as to get the benefit of the
heat.Owen waited for about half an hour to see if Hunter would return, but
as that disciple did not appear, he decided not to wait any longer.Before leaving he gave Bert some instructions:

'Keep up the fire with all the old paint that you can scrape off those
things and any other old paint or rubbish that's here, and whenever it
grows dull put more wood on.There's a lot of old stuff here that's of
no use except to be thrown away or burnt.If Hunter says
anything, tell him that I lit the fire, and that I told you to keep it
burning.If you want more wood, go out and take it.'On his way out Owen spoke to Sawkins.His manner was so menacing, his
face so pale, and there was such a strange glare in his eyes, that the
latter thought of the talk there had been about Owen being mad, and
felt half afraid of him.'I am going to the office to see Rushton; if Hunter comes here, you say
I told you to tell him that if I find the boy in that shop again
without a fire, I'll report it to the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children.And as for you, if the boy comes out here to get
more wood, don't you attempt to interfere with him.''I don't want to interfere with the bloody kid,' grunted Sawkins.'It
seems to me as if he's gorn orf 'is bloody crumpet,' he added as he
watched Owen walking rapidly down the street.'I can't understand why
people can't mind their own bloody business: anyone would think the boy
belonged to 'IM.'That was just how the matter presented itself to Owen.The idea that
it was his own child who was to be treated in this way possessed and
infuriated him as he strode savagely along.In the vicinity of the
Slave Market on the Grand Parade he passed--without seeing
them--several groups of unemployed artisans whom he knew.Some of them
were offended and remarked that he was getting stuck up, but others,
observing how strange he looked, repeated the old prophecy that one of
these days Owen would go out of his mind.As he drew near to his destination large flakes of snow began to fall.He walked so rapidly and was in such a fury that by the time he reached
the shop he was scarcely able to speak.'Is--Hunter--or Rushton here?''Hunter isn't, but the guv'nor is.'He'll soon--know--that,' panted Owen as he strode up to the office
door, and without troubling to knock, flung it violently open and
entered.The atmosphere of this place was very different from that of the damp
cellar where Bert was working.A grate fitted with asbestos blocks and
lit with gas communicated a genial warmth to the air.Rushton was standing leaning over Miss Wade's chair with his left arm
round her neck.Owen recollected afterwards that her dress was
disarranged.She retired hastily to the far end of the room as Rushton
jumped away from her, and stared in amazement and confusion at the
intruder--he was too astonished and embarrassed to speak.Owen stood
panting and quivering in the middle of the office and pointed a
trembling finger at his employer:

'I've come--here--to tell--you--that--if I find young--Bert
White--working--down in that shop--without a fire--I'll have you
prosecuted.The place is not good enough for a stable--if you owned a
valuable dog--you wouldn't keep it there--I give you fair warning--I
know--enough--about you--to put you--where you deserve to be--if you
don't treat him better I'll have you punished I'll show you up.'Rushton continued to stare at him in mingled confusion, fear and
perplexity; he did not yet comprehend exactly what it was all about; he
was guiltily conscious of so many things which he might reasonably fear
to be shown up or prosecuted for if they were known, and the fact of
being caught under such circumstances with Miss Wade helped to reduce
him to a condition approaching terror.'If the boy has been there without a fire, I 'aven't known anything
about it,' he stammered at last.'Mr 'Unter has charge of all those
matters.''You--yourself--forbade him--to make a fire last winter--and
anyhow--you know about it now.You obtained money from his mother
under the pretence--that you were going--to teach him a trade--but for
the last twelve months--you have been using him--as if he were--a beast
of burden.I advise you to see to it--or I shall--find--means--to make
you--wish you had done so.'With this Owen turned and went out, leaving the door open, and Rushton
in a state of mind compounded of fear, amazement and anger.As he walked homewards through the snow-storm, Owen began to realize
that the consequence of what he had done would be that Rushton would
not give him any more work, and as he reflected on all that this would
mean to those at home, for a moment he doubted whether he had done
right.But when he told Nora what had happened she said there were
plenty of other firms in the town who would employ him--when they had
the work.He had done without Rushton before and could do so again;
for her part--whatever the consequences might be--she was glad that he
had acted as he did.'We'll get through somehow, I suppose,' said Owen, wearily.'There's
not much chance of getting a job anywhere else just now, but I shall
try to get some work on my own account.I shall do some samples of
show-cards the same as I did last winter and try to get orders from
some of the shops--they usually want something extra at this time, but
I'm afraid it is rather too late: most of them already have all they
want.''I shouldn't go out again today if I were you,' said Nora, noticing how
ill he looked.'You should stay at home and read, or write up those
minutes.'The minutes referred to were those of the last meeting of the local
branch of the Painters' Society, of which Owen was the secretary, and
as the snow continued to fall, he occupied himself after dinner in the
manner his wife suggested, until four o'clock, when Frankie returned
from school bringing with him a large snowball, and crying out as a
piece of good news that the snow was still falling heavily, and that he
believed it was freezing!They went to bed very early that night, for it was necessary to
economize the coal, and not only that, but--because the rooms were so
near the roof--it was not possible to keep the place warm no matter how
much coal was used.The fire seemed, if anything, to make the place
colder, for it caused the outer air to pour in through the joints of
the ill-fitting doors and windows.Owen lay awake for the greater part of the night.The terror of the
future made rest or sleep impossible.He got up very early the next
morning--long before it was light--and after lighting the fire, set
about preparing the samples he had mentioned to Nora, but found that it
would not be possible to do much in this direction without buying more
cardboard, for most of what he had was not in good condition.They had bread and butter and tea for breakfast.Frankie had his in
bed and it was decided to keep him away from school until after dinner
because the weather was so very cold and his only pair of boots were so
saturated with moisture from having been out in the snow the previous
day.'I shall make a few inquiries to see if there's any other work to be
had before I buy the cardboard,' said Owen, 'although I'm afraid it's
not much use.'Just as he was preparing to go out, the front door bell rang, and as he
was going down to answer it he saw Bert White coming upstairs.The boy
was carrying a flat, brown-paper parcel under his arm.'A corfin plate,' he explained as he arrived at the door.'Wanted at
once--Misery ses you can do it at 'ome, an' I've got to wait for it.'Owen and his wife looked at each other with intense relief.So he was
not to be dismissed after all.'There's a piece of paper inside the parcel with the name of the party
what's dead,' continued Bert, 'and here's a little bottle of Brunswick
black for you to do the inscription with.''Yes: he told me to tell you there's a job to be started Monday
morning--a couple of rooms to be done out somewhere.Got to be
finished by Thursday; and there's another job 'e wants you to do this
afternoon--after dinner--so you've got to come to the yard at one
o'clock.'E told me to tell you 'e meant to leave a message for you
yesterday morning, but 'e forgot.''What did he say to you about the fire--anything?''Yes: they both of 'em came about an hour after you went away--Misery
and the Bloke too--but they didn't kick up a row.I wasn't arf
frightened, I can tell you, when I saw 'em both coming, but they was
quite nice.The Bloke ses to me, "Ah, that's right, my boy," 'e ses.I'm going to send you some coke," 'e ses.And
then they 'ad a look round and 'e told Sawkins to put some new panes of
glass where the winder was broken, and--you know that great big
packing-case what was under the truck shed?''Well, 'e told Sawkins to saw it up and cover over the stone floor of
the paint-shop with it.It ain't 'arf all right there now.I've
cleared out all the muck from under the benches and we've got two sacks
of coke sent from the gas-works, and the Bloke told me when that's all
used up I've got to get a order orf Miss Wade for another lot.'At one o'clock Owen was at the yard, where he saw Misery, who
instructed him to go to the front shop and paint some numbers on the
racks where the wallpapers were stored.Whilst he was doing this work
Rushton came in and greeted him in a very friendly way.'I'm very glad you let me know about the boy working in that
paint-shop,' he observed after a few preliminary remarks.'I can
assure you as I don't want the lad to be uncomfortable, but you know I
can't attend to everything myself.I'm much obliged to you for telling
me about it; I think you did quite right; I should have done the same
myself.'Owen did not know what to reply, but Rushton walked off without
waiting...



Chapter 52

'It's a Far, Far Better Thing that I do, than I have Ever Done'


Although Owen, Easton and Crass and a few others were so lucky as to
have had a little work to do during the last few months, the majority
of their fellow workmen had been altogether out of employment most of
the time, and meanwhile the practical business-men, and the pretended
disciples of Christ--the liars and hypocrites who professed to believe
that all men are brothers and God their Father--had continued to enact
the usual farce that they called 'Dealing' with the misery that
surrounded them on every side.They continued to organize 'Rummage'
and 'Jumble' sales and bazaars, and to distribute their rotten cast-off
clothes and boots and their broken victuals and soup to such of the
Brethren as were sufficiently degraded to beg for them.The beautiful
Distress Committee was also in full operation; over a thousand Brethren
had registered themselves on its books.Of this number--after careful
investigation--the committee had found that no fewer than six hundred
and seventy-two were deserving of being allowed to work for their
living.The Committee would probably have given these six hundred and
seventy-two the necessary permission, but it was somewhat handicapped
by the fact that the funds at its disposal were only sufficient to
enable that number of Brethren to be employed for about three days.However, by adopting a policy of temporizing, delay, and general artful
dodging, the Committee managed to create the impression that they were
Dealing with the Problem.If it had not been for a cunning device invented by Brother Rushton, a
much larger number of the Brethren would have succeeded in registering
themselves as unemployed on the books of the Committee.In previous
years it had been the practice to issue an application form called a
'Record Paper' to any Brother who asked for one, and the Brother
returned it after filling it in himself.At a secret meeting of the
Committee Rushton proposed--amid laughter and applause, it was such a
good joke--a new and better way, calculated to keep down the number of
applicants.The result of this innovation was that no more forms were
issued, but the applicants for work were admitted into the office one
at a time, and were there examined by a junior clerk, somewhat after
the manner of a French Juge d'Instruction interrogating a criminal, the
clerk filling in the form according to the replies of the culprit.'Where did you live before you went there?''How long were you living at that place?''Did you owe any rent when you left?''What is your Trade, Calling, Employment, or Occupation?''Are you Married or single or a Widower or what?''What kind of a house do you live in?'What have you been doing for the last five years?What kind of work,
how many hours a day?'Give the full names and addresses of all the different employers you
have worked for during the last five years, and the reasons why you
left them?''Give the names of all the foremen you have worked under during the
last five years?''Do you get any money from any Club or Society, or from any Charity, or
from any other source?''Have you ever worked for a Distress Committee before?''Have you ever done any other kinds of work than those you have
mentioned?Do you think you would be fit for any other kind?When the criminal had answered all the questions, and when his answers
had all been duly written down, he was informed that a member of the
Committee, or an Authorized Officer, or some Other Person, would in due
course visit his home and make inquiries about him, after which the
Authorized Officer or Other Person would make a report to the
Committee, who would consider it at their next meeting.As the interrogation of each criminal occupied about half an hour, to
say nothing of the time he was kept waiting, it will be seen that as a
means of keeping down the number of registered unemployed the idea
worked splendidly.When Rushton introduced this new rule it was carried unanimously, Dr
Weakling being the only dissentient, but of course he--as Brother
Grinder remarked--was always opposed to any sensible proposal.There
was one consolation, however, Grinder added, they was not likely to be
pestered with 'im much longer; the first of November was coming and if
he--Grinder--knowed anything of working men they was sure to give
Weakling the dirty kick out directly they got the chance.A few days afterwards the result of the municipal election justified
Brother Grinder's prognostications, for the working men voters of Dr
Weakling's ward did give him the dirty kick out: but Rushton, Didlum,
Grinder and several other members of the band were triumphantly
returned with increased majorities.Mr Dauber, of Dauber and Botchit, had already been elected a Guardian
of the Poor.During all this time Hunter, who looked more worried and miserable as
the dreary weeks went by, was occupied every day in supervising what
work was being done and in running about seeking for more.Nearly
every night he remained at the office until a late hour, poring over
specifications and making out estimates.The police had become so
accustomed to seeing the light in the office that as a rule they took
no notice of it, but one Thursday night--exactly one week after the
scene between Owen and Rushton about the boy--the constable on the beat
observed the light there much later than usual.At first he paid no
particular attention to the fact, but when night merged into morning
and the light still remained, his curiosity was aroused.He knocked at the door, but no one came in answer, and no sound
disturbed the deathlike stillness that reigned within.The door was
locked, but he was not able to tell whether it had been closed from the
inside or outside, because it had a spring latch.The office window
was low down, but it was not possible to see in because the back of the
glass had been painted.The constable thought that the most probable explanation of the mystery
was that whoever had been there earlier in the evening had forgotten to
turn out the light when they went away; it was not likely that thieves
or anyone who had no business to be there would advertise their
presence by lighting the gas.He made a note of the incident in his pocket-book and was about to
resume his beat when he was joined by his inspector.The latter agreed
that the conclusion arrived at by the constable was probably the right
one and they were about to pass on when the inspector noticed a small
speck of light shining through the lower part of the painted window,
where a small piece of the paint had either been scratched or had
shelled off the glass.He knelt down and found that it was possible to
get a view of the interior of the office, and as he peered through he
gave a low exclamation.When he made way for his subordinate to look
in his turn, the constable was with some difficulty able to distinguish
the figure of a man lying prone upon the floor.It was an easy task for the burly policeman to force open the office
door: a single push of his shoulder wrenched it from its fastenings and
as it flew back the socket of the lock fell with a splash into a great
pool of blood that had accumulated against the threshold, flowing from
the place where Hunter was lying on his back, his arms extended and his
head nearly severed from his body.On the floor, close to his right
hand, was an open razor.An overturned chair lay on the floor by the
side of the table where he usually worked, the table itself being
littered with papers and drenched with blood.Within the next few days Crass resumed the role he had played when
Hunter was ill during the summer, taking charge of the work and
generally doing his best to fill the dead man's place, although--as he
confided to certain of his cronies in the bar of the Cricketers--he had
no intention of allowing Rushton to do the same as Hunter had done.One of his first jobs--on the morning after the discovery of the
body--was to go with Mr Rushton to look over a house where some work
was to be done for which an estimate had to be given.It was this
estimate that Hunter had been trying to make out the previous evening
in the office, for they found that the papers on his table were covered
with figures and writing relating to this work.These papers justified
the subsequent verdict of the Coroner's jury that Hunter committed
suicide in a fit of temporary insanity, for they were covered with a
lot of meaningless scribbling, the words wrongly spelt and having no
intelligible connection with each other.There was one sum that he had
evidently tried repeatedly to do correctly, but which came wrong in a
different way every time.The fact that he had the razor in his
possession seemed to point to his having premeditated the act, but this
was accounted for at the inquest by the evidence of the last person who
saw him alive, a hairdresser, who stated that Hunter had left the razor
with him to be sharpened a few days previously and that he had called
for it on the evening of the tragedy.He had ground this razor for Mr
Hunter several times before.Crass took charge of all the arrangements for the funeral.He bought a
new second-hand pair of black trousers at a cast-off clothing shop in
honour of the occasion, and discarded his own low-crowned silk
hat--which was getting rather shabby--in favour of Hunter's tall one,
which he found in the office and annexed without hesitation or scruple.It was rather large for him, but he put some folded strips of paper
inside the leather lining.Crass was a proud man as he walked in
Hunter's place at the head of the procession, trying to look solemn,
but with a half-smile on his fat, pasty face, destitute of colour
except one spot on his chin near his underlip, where there was a small
patch of inflammation about the size of a threepenny piece.This spot
had been there for a very long time.At first--as well as he could
remember--it was only a small pimple, but it had grown larger, with
something the appearance of scurvy.Crass attributed its continuation
to the cold having 'got into it last winter'.It was rather strange,
too, because he generally took care of himself when it was cold: he
always wore the warm wrap that had formerly belonged to the old lady
who died of cancer.However, Crass did not worry much about this
little sore place; he just put a little zinc ointment on it
occasionally and had no doubt that it would get well in time.Chapter 53

Barrington Finds a Situation


The revulsion of feeling that Barrington experienced during the
progress of the election was intensified by the final result.The
blind, stupid, enthusiastic admiration displayed by the philanthropists
for those who exploited and robbed them; their extraordinary apathy
with regard to their own interests; the patient, broken-spirited way in
which they endured their sufferings, tamely submitting to live in
poverty in the midst of the wealth they had helped to create; their
callous indifference to the fate of their children, and the savage
hatred they exhibited towards anyone who dared to suggest the
possibility of better things, forced upon him the thought that the
hopes he cherished were impossible of realization.The words of the
renegade Socialist recurred constantly to his mind:

'You can be a Jesus Christ if you like, but for my part I'm finished.For the future I intend to look after myself.As for these people,
they vote for what they want, they get what they vote for, and, by God!They are being beaten with whips of their
own choosing, and if I had my way they should be chastised with
scorpions.For them, the present system means joyless drudgery,
semi-starvation, rags and premature death; and they vote for it and
uphold it.Let them drudge and let
them starve!'These words kept ringing in his ears as he walked through the crowded
streets early one fine evening a few days before Christmas.The shops
were all brilliantly lighted for the display of their Christmas stores,
and the pavements and even the carriageways were thronged with
sightseers.Barrington was specially interested in the groups of shabbily dressed
men and women and children who gathered in the roadway in front of the
poulterers' and butchers' shops, gazing at the meat and the serried
rows of turkeys and geese decorated with  ribbons and rosettes.He knew that to come here and look at these things was the only share
many of these poor people would have of them, and he marvelled greatly
at their wonderful patience and abject resignation.But what struck him most of all was the appearance of many of the
women, evidently working men's wives.Their faded, ill-fitting
garments and the tired, sad expressions on their pale and careworn
faces.Some of them were alone; others were accompanied by little
children who trotted along trustfully clinging to their mothers' hands.The sight of these poor little ones, their utter helplessness and
dependence, their patched unsightly clothing and broken boots, and the
wistful looks on their pitiful faces as they gazed into the windows of
the toy-shops, sent a pang of actual physical pain to his heart and
filled his eyes with tears.He knew that these children--naked of joy
and all that makes life dear--were being tortured by the sight of the
things that were placed so cruelly before their eyes, but which they
were not permitted to touch or to share; and, like Joseph of old, his
heart yearned over his younger brethren.He felt like a criminal because he was warmly clad and well fed in the
midst of all this want and unhappiness, and he flushed with shame
because he had momentarily faltered in his devotion to the noblest
cause that any man could be privileged to fight for--the uplifting of
the disconsolate and the oppressed.He presently came to a large toy shop outside which several children
were standing admiring the contents of the window.He recognized some
of these children and paused to watch them and to listen to their talk.They did not notice him standing behind them as they ranged to and fro
before the window, and as he looked at them, he was reminded of the way
in which captive animals walk up and down behind the bars of their
cages.These children wandered repeatedly, backwards and forwards from
one end of the window to the other, with their little hands pressed
against the impenetrable plate glass, choosing and pointing out to each
other the particular toys that took their fancies.cried Charley Linden, enthusiastically indicating a
large strongly built waggon.'If I had that I'd give Freddie rides in
it and bring home lots of firewood, and we could play at fire engines
as well.''I'd rather have this railway,' said Frankie Owen.'There's a real
tunnel and real coal in the tenders; then there's the station and the
signals and a place to turn the engine round, and a red lantern to
light when there's danger on the line.''Mine's this doll--not the biggest one, the one in pink with clothes
that you can take off,' said Elsie; 'and this tea set; and this
needlecase for Mother.'Little Freddie had let go his hold of Elsie, to whom he usually clung
tightly and was clapping his hands and chuckling with delight and
desire.'But it's no use lookin' at them any longer,' continued Elsie, with a
sigh, as she took hold of Freddie's hand to lead him away.'It's no
use lookin' at 'em any longer; the likes of us can't expect to have
such good things as them.'This remark served to recall Frankie and Charley to the stern realities
of life, and turning reluctantly away from the window they prepared to
follow Elsie, but Freddie had not yet learnt the lesson--he had not
lived long enough to understand that the good things of the world were
not for the likes of him; so when Elsie attempted to draw him away he
pursed up his underlip and began to cry, repeating that he wanted a
gee-gee.The other children clustered round trying to coax and comfort
him by telling him that no one was allowed to have anything out of the
windows yet--until Christmas--and that Santa Claus would be sure to
bring him a gee-gee then; but these arguments failed to make any
impression on Freddie, who tearfully insisted upon being supplied at
once.Whilst they were thus occupied they caught sight of Barrington, whom
they hailed with evident pleasure born of the recollection of certain
gifts of pennies and cakes they had at different times received from
him.'Hello, Mr Barrington,' said the two boys in a breath.'Hello,' replied Barrington, as he patted the baby's cheek.'He wants that there 'orse, mister, the one with the real 'air on,'
said Charley, smiling indulgently like a grown-up person who realized
the absurdity of the demand.'Fweddie want gee-gee,' repeated the child, taking hold of Barrington's
hand and returning to the window.'Tell him that Santa Claus'll bring it to him on Christmas,' whispered
Elsie.'P'raps he'll believe you and that'll satisfy him, and he's
sure to forget all about it in a little while.''Are you still out of work, Mr Barrington?''I've got something to do at last.''Well, that's a good job, ain't it?''And whom do you think I'm working for?'echoed the children, opening their eyes to the fullest
extent.'Yes,' continued Barrington, solemnly.'You know, he is a very old man
now, so old that he can't do all his work himself.Last year he was so
tired that he wasn't able to get round to all the children he wanted to
give things to, and consequently a great many of them never got
anything at all.So this year he's given me a job to help him.He's
given me some money and a list of children's names, and against their
names are written the toys they are to have.My work is to buy the
things and give them to the boys and girls whose names are on the list.'The children listened to this narrative with bated breath.Incredible
as the story seemed, Barrington's manner was so earnest as to almost
compel belief.'Really and truly, or are you only having a game?'said Frankie at
length, speaking almost in a whisper.Elsie and Charley maintained an
awestruck silence, while Freddie beat upon the glass with the palms of
his hands.'Really and truly,' replied Barrington unblushingly as he took out his
pocket-book and turned over the leaves.'I've got the list here;
perhaps your names are down for something.'The three children turned pale and their hearts beat violently as they
listened wide-eyed for what was to follow.'Let me see,' continued Barrington, scanning the pages of the book,
'Why, yes, here they are!Elsie Linden, one doll with clothes that can
be taken off, one tea-set, one needlecase.Freddie Easton, one horse
with real hair.Charley Linden, one four-wheeled waggon full of
groceries.Frankie Owen, one railway with tunnel, station, train with
real coal for engine, signals, red lamp and place to turn the engines
round.'Barrington closed the book: 'So you may as well have your things now,'
he continued, speaking in a matter-of-fact tone.'We'll buy them here;
it will save me a lot of work.I shall not have the trouble of taking
them round to where you live.It's lucky I happened to meet you, isn't
it?'The children were breathless with emotion, but they just managed to
gasp out that it was--very lucky.As they followed him into the shop, Freddie was the only one of the
four whose condition was anything like normal.All the others were in
a half-dazed state.Frankie was afraid that he was not really awake at
all.It couldn't be true; it must be a dream.In addition to the hair, the horse was furnished with four wheels.They
did not have it made into a parcel, but tied some string to it and
handed it over to its new owner.The elder children were scarcely
conscious of what took place inside the shop; they knew that Barrington
was talking to the shopman, but they did not hear what was said--the
sound seemed far away and unreal.The shopman made the doll, the tea-set and the needlecase into one
parcel and gave it to Elsie.The railway, in a stout cardboard box,
was also wrapped up in brown paper, and Frankie's heart nearly burst
when the man put the package into his arms.When they came out of the toy shop they said 'Good night' to Frankie,
who went off carrying his parcel very carefully and feeling as if he
were walking on air.The others went into a provision merchant's near
by, where the groceries were purchased and packed into the waggon.Then Barrington, upon referring to the list to make quite certain that
he had not forgotten anything, found that Santa Claus had put down a
pair of boots each for Elsie and Charley, and when they went to buy
these, it was seen that their stockings were all ragged and full of
holes, so they went to a draper's and bought some stocking also.Barrington said that although they were not on the list, he was sure
Santa Claus would not object--he had probably meant them to have them,
but had forgotten to put them down.Chapter 54

The End


The following evening Barrington called at Owen's place.He said he
was going home for the holidays and had come to say goodbye for a time.Owen had not been doing very well during these last few months,
although he was one of the few lucky ones who had had some small share
of work.Most of the money he earned went for rent, to pay which they
often had to go short of food.Lately his chest had become so bad that
the slightest exertion brought on fits of coughing and breathlessness,
which made it almost impossible to work even when he had the
opportunity; often it was only by an almost superhuman effort of will
that he was able to continue working at all.He contrived to keep up
appearances to a certain extent before Rushton, who, although he knew
that Owen was not so strong as the other men, was inclined to overlook
it so long as he was able to do his share of work, for Owen was a very
useful hand when things were busy.But lately some of the men with
whom he worked began to manifest dissatisfaction at having him for a
mate.When two men are working together, the master expects to see two
men's work done, and if one of the two is not able to do his share it
makes it all the harder for the other.He never had the money to go to a doctor to get advice, but earlier in
the winter he had obtained from Rushton a ticket for the local
hospital.Every Saturday throughout the year when the men were paid
they were expected to put a penny or twopence in the hospital box.Contributions were obtained in this way from every firm and workshop in
the town.The masters periodically handed these boxes over to the
hospital authorities and received in return some tickets which they
gave to anyone who needed and asked for them.The employer had to fill
in the ticket or application form with the name and address of the
applicant, and to certify that in his opinion the individual was a
deserving case,'suitable to receive this charity'.In common with the
majority of workmen, Owen had a sort of horror of going for advice to
this hospital, but he was so ill that he stifled his pride and went.It happened that it turned out to be more expensive than going to a
private doctor, for he had to be at the hospital at a certain hour on a
particular morning.To do this he had to stay away from work.The
medicine they prescribed and which he had to buy did him no good, for
the truth was that it was not medicine that he--like thousands of
others--needed, but proper conditions of life and proper food; things
that had been for years past as much out of his reach as if he had been
dying alone in the middle of a desert.Occasionally Nora contrived--by going without some other necessary--to
buy him a bottle of one of the many much-advertised medicines; but
although some of these things were good she was not able to buy enough
for him to derive any benefit from them.Although he was often seized with a kind of terror of the future--of
being unable to work--he fought against these feelings and tried to
believe that when the weather became warmer he would be all right once
more.When Barrington came in Owen was sitting in a deck-chair by the fire in
the sitting-room.He had been to work that day with Harlow, washing off
the ceilings and stripping the old paper from the walls of two rooms in
Rushton's home, and he looked very haggard and exhausted.'I have never told you before,' said Barrington, after they had been
talking for a while, 'but I suppose you have guessed that I did not
work for Rushton because I needed to do so in order to live.I just
wanted to see things for myself; to see life as it is lived by the
majority.He doesn't approve of my
opinions, but at same time he does not interfere with me for holding
them, and I have a fairly liberal allowance which I spent in my own
way.I'm going to pass Christmas with my own people, but in the spring
I intend to fit out a Socialist Van, and then I shall come back here.We'll have some of the best speakers in the movement; we'll hold
meetings every night; we'll drench the town with literature, and we'll
start a branch of the party.'Owen's eye kindled and his pale face flushed.'I shall be able to do something to advertise the meetings,' he said.For instance, I could paint some posters and placards.''And I can help to give away handbills,' chimed in Frankie, looking up
from the floor, where he was seated working the railway.'I know a lot
of boys who'll come along with me to put 'em under the doors as well.'They were in the sitting-room and the door was shut.Mrs Owen was in
the next room with Ruth.While the two men were talking the front-door
bell was heard to ring and Frankie ran out to see who it was, closing
the door after him.Barrington and Owen continued their conversation,
and from time to time they could hear a low murmur of voices from the
adjoining room.After a little while they heard some one go out by the
front door, and almost immediately afterward Frankie--wild with
excitement, burst into the room, crying out:

'Dad and Mr Barrington!And he began capering
gleefully about the room, evidently transported with joy.inquired Barrington, rather mystified
by this extraordinary conduct.'Mr Easton came with Freddie to see Mrs Easton, and she's gone home
again with them,' replied Freddie, 'and--she's given the baby to us for
a Christmas box!'Barrington was already familiar with the fact of Easton's separation
from his wife, and Owen now told him the Story of their reconciliation.His train left at eight;
it was already nearly half past seven, and he said he had a letter to
write.Nora brought the baby in to show him before he went, and then
she helped Frankie to put on his overcoat, for Barrington had requested
that the boy might be permitted to go a little way with him.There was a stationer's shop at the end of the street.He went in here
and bought a sheet of notepaper and an envelope, and, having borrowed
the pen and ink, wrote a letter which he enclosed in the envelope with
the two other pieces that he took out of his pocketbook.Having
addressed the letter he came out of the shop; Frankie was waiting for
him outside.'I want you to take this straight home and give it to your dad.I
don't want you to stop to play or even to speak to anyone till you get
home.''I won't stop running all the way.''I think I have time to
go back with you as far as your front door,' he said, 'then I shall be
quite sure you haven't lost it.'They accordingly retraced their steps and in a few minutes reached the
entrance to the house.Barrington opened the door and stood for a
moment in the hall watching Frankie ascend the stairs.inquired the boy, pausing and
looking over the banisters.'Because we can see the bridge from our front-room window, and if you
were to wave your handkerchief as your train goes over the bridge, we
could wave back.'Barrington waited till he heard Frankie open and close the door of
Owen's flat, and then he hurried away.When he gained the main road he
heard the sound of singing and saw a crowd at the corner of one of the
side-streets.As he drew near he perceived that it was a religious
meeting.There was a lighted lamp on a standard in the centre of the crowd and
on the glass of this lamp was painted: 'Be not deceived: God is not
mocked.'Mr Rushton was preaching in the centre of the ring.He said that they
had come hout there that evening to tell the Glad Tidings of Great Joy
to hall those dear people that he saw standing around.The members of
the Shining Light Chapel--to which he himself belonged--was the
organizers of that meeting but it was not a sectarian meeting, for he
was 'appy to say that several members of other denominations was there
co-operating with them in the good work.As he continued his address,
Rushton repeatedly referred to the individuals who composed the crowd
as his 'Brothers and Sisters' and, strange to say, nobody laughed.Barrington looked round upon the 'Brothers': Mr Sweater, resplendent in
a new silk hat of the latest fashion, and a fur-trimmed overcoat.Mr Bosher, Vicar of the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, Mr
Grinder--one of the churchwardens at the same place of alleged
worship--both dressed in broadcloth and fine linen and glossy silk
hats, while their general appearance testified to the fact that they
had fared sumptuously for many days.Mr Didlum, Mrs Starvem, Mr
Dauber, Mr Botchit, Mr Smeeriton, and Mr Leavit.John Starr, doing the work for which he
was paid.As he stood there in the forefront of this company, there was nothing
in his refined and comely exterior to indicate that his real function
was to pander to and flatter them; to invest with an air of
respectability and rectitude the abominably selfish lives of the gang
of swindlers, slave-drivers and petty tyrants who formed the majority
of the congregation of the Shining Light Chapel.He was doing the work for which he was paid.By the mere fact of his
presence there, condoning and justifying the crimes of these typical
representatives of that despicable class whose greed and inhumanity
have made the earth into a hell.There was also a number of'respectable', well-dressed people who
looked as if they could do with a good meal, and a couple of shabbily
dressed, poverty-stricken-looking individuals who seemed rather out of
place in the glittering throng.The remainder of the Brothers consisted of half-starved, pale-faced
working men and women, most of them dressed in other people's cast-off
clothing, and with broken, patched-up, leaky boots on their feet.Rushton having concluded his address, Didlum stepped forward to give
out the words of the hymn the former had quoted at the conclusion of
his remarks:


        'Oh, come and jine this 'oly band,
        And hon to glory go.'Strange and incredible as it may appear to the reader, although none of
them ever did any of the things Jesus said, the people who were
conducting this meeting had the effrontery to claim to be followers of
Christ--Christians!Jesus said: 'Lay not up for yourselves treasure upon earth', 'Love not
the world nor the things of the world', 'Woe unto you that are rich--it
is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich
man to enter the kingdom of heaven.'Yet all these self-styled
'Followers' of Christ made the accumulation of money the principal
business of their lives.Jesus said: 'Be ye not called masters; for they bind heavy burdens and
grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders, but they
themselves will not touch them with one of their fingers.For one is
your master, even Christ, and ye are all brethren.'But nearly all
these alleged followers of the humble Workman of Nazareth claimed to be
other people's masters or mistresses.And as for being all brethren,
whilst most of these were arrayed in broadcloth and fine linen and
fared sumptuously every day, they knew that all around them thousands
of those they hypocritically called their 'brethren', men, women and
little children, were slowly perishing of hunger and cold; and we have
already seen how much brotherhood existed between Sweater and Rushton
and the miserable, half-starved wretches in their employment.Whenever they were asked why they did not practise the things Jesus
preached, they replied that it is impossible to do so!They did not
seem to realize that when they said this they were saying, in effect,
that Jesus taught an impracticable religion; and they appeared to
forget that Jesus said, 'Wherefore call ye me Lord, Lord, when ye do
not the things I say?...''Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and
doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house
upon the sand.'But although none of these self-styled 'Followers' of Christ, ever did
the things that Jesus said, they talked a great deal about them, and
sang hymns, and for a pretence made long prayers, and came out here to
exhort those who were still in darkness to forsake their evil ways.And
they procured this lantern and wrote a text upon it: 'Be not deceived,
God is not mocked.'They stigmatized as 'infidels' all those who differed from them,
forgetting that the only real infidels are those who are systematically
false and unfaithful to the Master they pretend to love and serve.Grinder, having a slight cold, had not spoken this evening, but several
other infidels, including Sweater, Didlum, Bosher, and Starr, had
addressed the meeting, making a special appeal to the working people,
of whom the majority of the crowd was composed, to give up all the vain
pleasures of the world in which they at present indulged, and, as
Rushton had eloquently put it at the close of his remarks:

        'Come and jine this 'Oly band and hon to glory go!'As Didlum finished reading out the words, the lady at the harmonium
struck up the tune of the hymns, and the disciples all joined in the
singing:

        'Oh, come and join this 'oly band and hon to glory go.'During the singing certain of the disciples went about amongst the
crowd distributing tracts.Presently one of them offered one to
Barrington and as the latter looked at the man he saw that it was
Slyme, who also recognized him at the same instant and greeted him by
name.Barrington made no reply except to decline the tract:

'I don't want that--from you,' he said contemptuously.'Oh, I know what you're thinking of,' he said after
a pause and speaking in an injured tone; 'but you shouldn't judge
anyone too hard.It wasn't only my fault, and you don't know 'ow much
I've suffered for it.If it 'adn't been for the Lord, I believe I
should 'ave drownded myself.'Barrington made no answer and Slyme slunk off, and when the hymn was
finished Brother Sweater stood forth and gave all those present a
hearty invitation to attend the services to be held during the ensuing
week at the Chapel of the Shining Light.He invited them there
specially, of course, because it was the place with which he was
himself connected, but he entreated and begged of them even if they
would not come there to go Somewhere; there were plenty of other places
of worship in the town; in fact, there was one at the corner of nearly
every street.Those who did not fancy the services at the Shining
Light could go to the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, but he really did
hope that all those dear people whom he saw standing round would go
Somewhere.A short prayer from Bosher closed the meeting, and now the reason for
the presence of the two poverty-stricken-looking shabbily dressed
disciples was made manifest, for while the better dressed and therefore
more respectable Brothers were shaking hands with and grinning at each
other or hovering round the two clergymen and Mr Sweater, these two
poor wretches carried away the harmonium and the lantern, together with
the hymn books and what remained of the tracts.As Barrington hurried
off to catch the train one of the 'Followers' gave him a card which he
read by the light of a street lamp--

                   Come and join the Brotherhood
                    at the Shining Light Chapel
                                PSA
                    Every Sunday at 3 o'clock.'Oh come and join this Holy Band
                        and on to Glory go.'Barrington thought he would, rather go to hell--if there were such a
place--with some decent people, than share 'glory' with a crew like
this.Nora sat sewing by the fireside in the front room, with the baby asleep
in her lap.Owen was reclining in the deck-chair opposite.They had
both been rather silent and thoughtful since Barrington's departure.It was mainly by their efforts that the reconciliation between Easton
and Ruth had been effected and they had been so desirous of
accomplishing that result that they had not given much thought to their
own position.'I feel that I could not bear to part with her for anything now,' said
Nora at last breaking the long silence, 'and Frankie is so fond of her
too.But all the same I can't feel happy about it when I think how ill
you are.''Oh, I shall be all right when the weather gets a little warmer,' said
Owen, affecting a cheerfulness he did not feel.'We have always pulled
through somehow or other; the poor little thing is not going to make
much difference, and she'll be as well off with us as she would have
been if Ruth had not gone back.'As he spoke he leaned over and touched the hand of the sleeping child
and the little fingers closed round one of his with a clutch that sent
a thrill all through him.As he looked at this little helpless,
dependent creature, he realized with a kind of thankfulness that he
would never have the heart to carry out the dreadful project he had
sometimes entertained in hours of despondency.'We've always got through somehow or other,' he repeated, 'and we'll do
so still.'Presently they heard Frankie's footsteps ascending the stairs and a
moment afterwards the boy entered the room.'We have to look out of the window and wave to Mr Barrington when his
train goes over the bridge,' he cried breathlessly.Open the window, quick, Dad, or it may be too late.''There's plenty of time yet,' replied Owen, smiling at the boy's
impetuosity.We don't want the window open
all that time.It's only a quarter to eight by our clock now, and
that's five minutes fast.'However, so as to make quite certain that the train should not run past
unnoticed, Frankie pulled up the blind and, rubbing the steam off the
glass, took up his station at the window to watch for its coming, while
Owen opened the letter:

'Dear Owen,

'Enclosed you will find two bank-notes, one for ten pounds and the
other for five.The first I beg you will accept from me for yourself
in the same spirit that I offer it, and as I would accept it from you
if our positions were reversed.If I were in need, I know that you
would willingly share with me whatever you had and I could not hurt you
by refusing.The other note I want you to change tomorrow morning.Give three pounds of it to Mrs Linden and the remainder to Bert White's
mother.'Wishing you all a happy Xmas and hoping to find you well and eager for
the fray when I come back in the spring,

                             'Yours for the cause,

                                                  'George Barrington.'Owen read it over two or three times before he could properly
understand it and then, without a word of comment--for he could not
have spoken at that moment to save his life--he passed it to Nora, who
felt, as she read it in her turn, as if a great burden had been lifted
from her heart.All the undefined terror of the future faded away as
she thought of all this small piece of paper made possible.Meanwhile, Frankie, at the window, was straining his eyes in the
direction of the station.'Don't you think we'd better have the window open now, Dad?'he said at
last as the clock struck eight.'The steam keeps coming on the glass
as fast as I wipe it off and I can't see out properly.I'm sure it's
nearly time now; p'raps our clock isn't as fast as you think it is.''All right, we'll have it open now, so as to be on the safe side,' said
Owen as he stood up and raised the sash, and Nora, having wrapped the
child up in a shawl, joined them at the window.'It can't be much longer now, you know,' said Frankie.They turned the red light off the signal just before you opened
the window.'In a very few minutes they heard the whistle of the locomotive as it
drew out of the station, then, an instant before the engine itself came
into sight round the bend, the brightly polished rails were
illuminated, shining like burnished gold in the glare of its headlight;
a few seconds afterwards the train emerged into view, gathering speed
as it came along the short stretch of straight way, and a moment later
it thundered across the bridge.It was too far away to recognize his
face, but they saw someone looking out of a carriage window waving a
handkerchief, and they knew it was Barrington as they waved theirs in
return.Soon there remained nothing visible of the train except the
lights at the rear of the guard's van, and presently even those
vanished into the surrounding darkness.The lofty window at which they were standing overlooked several of the
adjacent streets and a great part of the town.On the other side of the
road were several empty houses, bristling with different house agents'
advertisement boards and bills.About twenty yards away, the shop
formerly tenanted by Mr Smallman, the grocer, who had become bankrupt
two or three months previously, was also plastered with similar
decorations.A little further on, at the opposite corner, were the
premises of the Monopole Provision Stores, where brilliant lights were
just being extinguished, for they, like most of the other shops, were
closing their premises for the night, and the streets took on a more
cheerless air as one after another their lights disappeared.It had been a fine day, and during the earlier part of the evening the
moon, nearly at the full, had been shining in a clear and starry sky;
but a strong north-east wind had sprung up within the last hour; the
weather had become bitterly cold and the stars were rapidly being
concealed from view by the dense banks of clouds that were slowly
accumulating overhead.As they remained at the window looking out over this scene for a few
minutes after the train had passed out of sight, it seemed to Owen that
the gathering darkness was as a curtain that concealed from view the
Infamy existing beyond.In every country, myriads of armed men waiting
for their masters to give them the signal to fall upon and rend each
other like wild beasts.All around was a state of dreadful anarchy;
abundant riches, luxury, vice, hypocrisy, poverty, starvation, and
crime.Men literally fighting with each other for the privilege of
working for their bread, and little children crying with hunger and
cold and slowly perishing of want.The gloomy shadows enshrouding the streets, concealing for the time
their grey and mournful air of poverty and hidden suffering, and the
black masses of cloud gathering so menacingly in the tempestuous sky,
seemed typical of the Nemesis which was overtaking the Capitalist
System.That atrocious system which, having attained to the fullest
measure of detestable injustice and cruelty, was now fast crumbling
into ruin, inevitably doomed to be overwhelmed because it was all so
wicked and abominable, inevitably doomed to sink under the blight and
curse of senseless and unprofitable selfishness out of existence for
ever, its memory universally execrated and abhorred.But from these ruins was surely growing the glorious fabric of the
Co-operative Commonwealth.Mankind, awaking from the long night of
bondage and mourning and arising from the dust wherein they had lain
prone so long, were at last looking upward to the light that was riving
asunder and dissolving the dark clouds which had so long concealed from
them the face of heaven.The light that will shine upon the world wide
Fatherland and illumine the gilded domes and glittering pinnacles of
the beautiful cities of the future, where men shall dwell together in
true brotherhood and goodwill and joy.The Golden Light that will be
diffused throughout all the happy world from the rays of the risen sun
of Socialism.Appendix

Mugsborough


Mugsborough was a town of about eighty thousand inhabitants, about two
hundred miles from London.It was built in a verdant valley.Looking
west, north or east from the vicinity of the fountain on the Grand
Parade in the centre of the town, one saw a succession of pine-clad
hills.To the south, as far as the eye could see, stretched a vast,
cultivated plain that extended to the south coast, one hundred miles
away.The climate was supposed to be cool in summer and mild in winter.The town proper nestled in the valley: to the west, the most beautiful
and sheltered part was the suburb of Irene: here were the homes of the
wealthy residents and prosperous tradespeople, and numerous
boarding-houses for the accommodation of well-to-do visitors.East,
the town extended up the <DW72> to the top of the hill and down the
other side to the suburb of Windley, where the majority of the working
classes lived.Years ago, when the facilities for foreign travel were fewer and more
costly, Mugsborough was a favourite resort of the upper classes, but of
late years most of these patriots have adopted the practice of going on
the Continent to spend the money they obtain from the working people of
England.However, Mugsborough still retained some semblance of
prosperity.Summer or winter the place was usually fairly full of what
were called good-class visitors, either holidaymakers or invalids.The
Grand Parade was generally crowded with well-dressed people and
carriages.The shops appeared to be well-patronized and at the time of
our story an air of prosperity pervaded the town.But this fair
outward appearance was deceitful.The town was really a vast whited
sepulchre; for notwithstanding the natural advantages of the place the
majority of the inhabitants existed in a state of perpetual poverty
which in many cases bordered on destitution.One of the reasons for
this was that a great part of the incomes of the tradespeople and
boarding-house-keepers and about a third of the wages of the working
classes were paid away as rent and rates.For years the Corporation had been borrowing money for necessary public
works and improvements, and as the indebtedness of the town increased
the rates rose in proportion, because the only works and services
undertaken by the Council were such as did not yield revenue.Every
public service capable of returning direct profit was in the hands of
private companies, and the shares of the private companies were in the
hands of the members of the Corporation, and the members of the
Corporation were in the hands of the four most able and intellectual of
their number, Councillors Sweater, Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, each of
whom was a director of one or more of the numerous companies which
battened on the town.The Tramway Company, the Water Works Company, the Public Baths Company,
the Winter Gardens Company, the Grand Hotel Company and numerous
others.There was, however, one Company in which Sweater, Rushton,
Didlum and Grinder had no shares, and that was the Gas Company, the
oldest and most flourishing of them all.This institution had grown
with the place; most of the original promoters were dead, and the
greater number of the present shareholders were non-residents; although
they lived on the town, they did not live in it.The profits made by this Company were so great that, being prevented by
law from paying a larger dividend than ten percent, they frequently
found it a difficult matter to decide what to do with the money.They
paid the Directors and principal officials--themselves shareholders, of
course--enormous salaries.They built and furnished costly and
luxurious offices and gave the rest to the shareholders in the form of
Bonuses.There was one way in which the Company might have used some of the
profits: it might have granted shorter hours and higher wages to the
workmen whose health was destroyed and whose lives were shortened by
the terrible labour of the retort-houses and the limesheds; but of
course none of the directors or shareholders ever thought of doing
that.It was not the business of the Company to concern itself about
them.Years ago, when it might have been done for a comparatively small
amount, some hare-brained Socialists suggested that the town should buy
the Gas Works, but the project was wrecked by the inhabitants, upon
whom the mere mention of the word Socialist had the same effect that
the sight of a red rag is popularly supposed to have on a bull.Of course, even now it was still possible to buy out the Company, but
it was supposed that it would cost so much that it was generally
considered to be impracticable.Although they declined to buy the Gas works, the people of Mugsborough
had to buy the gas.The amount paid by the municipality to the Company
for the public lighting of the town loomed large in the accounts of the
Council.The review was to come off at four o'clock, when the July sun
would be somewhat diminished in warmth, and from some hints that Jerry
let fall, Mrs.Lockitt, and the fat cook, Mrs.Mincemeat, were holding
high council up at the house, over a certain collation to be partaken of
at the end of the entertainments.As the day wore on the excitement of our friends the Zouaves increased.They could hardly either eat their dinners, or sit down for more than a
moment at a time; and when, about three o'clock, Mr.Schermerhorn
entered the busy little camp, he was surrounded directly with a crowd of
eager questioners, all talking at once, and making as much noise as a
colony of rooks."Patience, patience, my good friends!"Schermerhorn, holding
up a finger for silence.Tom, here are your 'double
headers,' with love from your mother.Fred, I saw your father to-day,
and they are all coming down to the review.George, here is a note left
for you in my box at the Post Office, and Dashahed Zouaves in
general--I have one piece of advice to give you.Get dressed quietly,
and then sit down and rest yourselves.You will be tired out by the end
of the afternoon, at all events; so don't frisk about more than you can
help at present;" and Mr.Schermerhorn left the camp; while the boys,
under strong pressure of Jerry, and the distant notes of a band which
suddenly began to make itself heard, dressed themselves as nicely as
they could, and sat down with heroic determination to wait for four
o'clock.Presently, carriages began to crunch over the gravel road one after
another, filled with merry children, and not a few grown people besides.Jourdain, with Bella, were among the first to arrive; and
soon after the Carltons' barouche drove up.Jessie, for some unknown
reason, was full of half nervous glee, and broke into innumerable little
trilling laughs when any one spoke to her.A sheet of lilac note paper,
folded up tight, which she held in her hand, seemed to have something to
do with it, and her soft brown curls and spreading muslin skirts were in
equal danger of irremediable "mussing," as she fidgetted about on the
carriage seat, fully as restless as any of the Zouaves.Schermerhorn received his guests on the piazza, where all the chairs
in the house, one would think, were placed for the company, as the best
view of the lawn was from this point.To the extreme right were the
white tents of the camp, half hidden by the immense trunk of a
magnificent elm, the only tree that broke the smooth expanse of the
lawn.On the left a thick hawthorne hedge separated the ornamental
grounds from the cultivated fields of the place, while in front the view
was bounded by the blue and sparkling waters of the Sound.Soon four o'clock struck; and, punctual to the moment, the Zouaves could
be seen in the distance, forming their ranks.Jerry, in his newest suit
of regimentals, bustled about here and there, and presently his voice
was heard shouting, "Are ye all ready now?and to
the melodious notes of "Dixie," performed by the band, which was
stationed nearer the house, the regiment started up the lawn!Jerry
marching up beside them, and occasionally uttering such mysterious
mandates as, "Easy in the centre!Oh, what a burst of delighted applause greeted them as they neared the
house!The boys hurrahed, the girls clapped their hands, ladies and
gentlemen waved their hats and handkerchiefs; while the Dashahed
Zouaves, too soldierly _now_ to grin, drew up in a long line, and stood
like statues, without so much as winking.And now the music died away, and everybody was as still as a mouse,
while Jerry advanced to the front, and issued the preliminary order:

"To the rear--open order!"and the rear rank straightway fell back;
executing, in fact, that wonderful "tekkinapesstoth'rare" which had
puzzled them so much on the first day of their drilling.Then came those
other wonderful orders:

          "P'_sent_ humps!And so on, at which the muskets flew backward and forward, up and down,
with such wonderful precision.The spectators were delighted beyond
measure; an enthusiastic young gentleman, with about three hairs on
each side of his mustache, who belonged to the Twenty-second Regiment,
declared "It was the best drill he had seen out of his company room!"a
celebrated artist, whose name I dare not tell for the world, sharpened
his pencil, and broke the point off three times in his hurry, and at
last produced the beautiful sketch which appears at the front of this
volume; while all the little boys who were looking on, felt as if they
would give every one of their new boots and glass agates to belong to
the gallant Dashahed Zouaves.[Illustration: "DOUBLE-QUICK."]After the guns had been put in every possible variety of position, the
regiment went through their marching.They broke into companies,
formed the line again, divided in two equal parts, called "breaking into
platoons," showed how to "wheel on the right flank," and all manner of
other mysteries.Finally, they returned to their companies, and on Jerry's giving the
order, they started at "double quick" (which is the most comical
tritty-trot movement you can think of), dashed down the <DW72> of the
lawn, round the great elm, up hill again full speed, and in a moment
more were drawn up in unbroken lines before the house, and standing once
again like so many statues.Round after round of applause greeted the
Zouaves, who kept their positions for a moment, then snatching off
their saucy little fez caps, they gave the company three cheers in
return, of the most tremendous description; which quite took away the
little remaining breath they had after the "double quick."Thus ended the first part of the review; and now, with the assistance of
their rather Lilliputian battery, and Tom's double headers, they went
through some firing quite loud enough to make the little girls start and
jump uncomfortably; so this part of the entertainment was brought to
rather a sudden conclusion.Jerry had just issued the order, "Close up
in ranks to dismiss," when Mr.Schermerhorn, who, with Miss Carlton and
Jessie, had left the piazza a few minutes before, came forward, saying,
"Have the goodness to wait a moment, Colonel; there is one more ceremony
to go through with."The boys looked at each other in silent curiosity, wondering what could
be coming; when, all at once, the chairs on the piazza huddled back in a
great hurry, to make a lane for a beautiful little figure, which came
tripping from the open door.It was Jessie; but a great change had been made in her appearance.Over
her snowy muslin skirts she had a short classic tunic of red, white, and
blue silk; a wreath of red and white roses and bright blue jonquils
encircled her curls, and in her hand she carried a superb banner.It
was made of dark blue silk, trimmed with gold fringe; on one side was
painted an American eagle, and on the other the words "Dashahed
Zouaves," surrounded with a blaze of glory and gold stars.She advanced
to the edge of the piazza, and in a clear, sweet voice, a little
tremulous, but very distinct, she said:

          "COLONEL AND BRAVE SOLDIERS:

          "I congratulate you, in the name of our friends,
          on the success you have achieved.You have shown
          us to-day what Young America can do; and as a
          testimonial of our high admiration, I present you
          the colors of your regiment!"Take them, as the assurance that our hearts are
          with you; bear them as the symbol of the Cause you
          have enlisted under; and should you fall beneath
          them on the field of battle, I bid you lay down
          your lives cheerfully for the flag of your
          country, and breathe with your last sigh the name
          of the Union!Freddy's cheeks grew crimson, and the great tears swelled to his eyes as
he advanced to take the flag which Jessie held toward him.And now our
little Colonel came out bright, sure enough.Perhaps not another member
of the regiment, called upon to make a speech in this way, could have
thought of a word to reply; but Freddy's quick wit supplied him with
the right ideas; and it was with a proud, happy face, and clear voice
that he responded:

          "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:

          "I thank you, in the name of my regiment, for the
          honor you have done us.Inspired by your praises,
          proud to belong to the army of the Republic, we
          hope to go on as we have begun.To your kindness
          we owe the distinguishing colors under which we
          march hereafter; and by the Union for which we
          fight, they shall never float over a retreating
          battalion!"the cheers and clapping of hands which followed this little speech!Everybody was looking at Freddy as he stood there, the colors in his
hand, and the bright flush on his cheek, with the greatest admiration.Of course, his parents weren't proud of him; certainly not!But the wonders were not at an end yet; for suddenly the band began
playing a new air, and to this accompaniment, the sweet voice of some
lady unseen, but which sounded to those who knew, wonderfully like Miss
Lucy Carlton's, sang the following patriotic ballad:

          "We will stand by our Flag--let it lead where it will--
          Our hearts and our hopes fondly cling to it still;
          Through battle and danger our Cause must be won--
          Yet forward!still unsullied and bright,
          As when first its fair stars lit oppression's dark night
          And the standard that guides us forever shall be
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"A handful of living--an army of dead,
          The last charge been made and the last prayer been said;
          What is it--as sad we retreat from the plain
          That cheers us, and nerves us to rally again?to our country God-given,
          That gleams through our ranks like a glory from heaven!And the foe, as they fly, in our vanguard shall see
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"We will fight for the Flag, by the love that we bear
          In the Union and Freedom, we'll baffle despair;
          Trust on in our country, strike home for the right,
          And Treason shall vanish like mists of the night.every star in it glows,
          The terror of traitors!And the victory that crowns us shall glorified be,
          'Neath the Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"As the song ended, there was another tumult of applause; and then the
band struck up a lively quickstep, and the company, with the Zouaves
marching ahead, poured out on the lawn toward the camp, where a
bountiful collation was awaiting them, spread on the regimental table.Two splendid pyramids of flowers ornamented the centre, and all manner
of "goodies," as the children call them, occupied every inch of space on
the sides.At the head of the table Jerry had contrived a canopy from a
large flag, and underneath this, Miss Jessie, Colonel Freddy, with the
other officers, and some favored young ladies of their own age, took
their seats.The other children found places around the table, and a
merrier fete champetre never was seen.The band continued to play lively
airs from time to time, and I really can give you my word as an author,
that nobody looked cross for a single minute!Between you and me, little reader, there had been a secret arrangement
among the grown folks interested in the regiment, to get all this up in
such fine style.Every one had contributed something to give the Zouaves
their flag and music, while to Mr.Schermerhorn it fell to supply the
supper; and arrangements had been made and invitations issued since the
beginning of the week.The regiment, certainly, had the credit, however,
of getting up the review, it only having been the idea of their good
friends to have the entertainment and flag presentation.So there was a
pleasant surprise on both sides; and each party in the transaction, was
quite as much astonished and delighted as the other could wish.The long sunset shadows were rapidly stealing over the velvet sward as
the company rose from table, adding a new charm to the beauty of the
scene.Everywhere the grass was dotted with groups of elegant ladies and
gentlemen, and merry children, in light summer dresses and quaintly
pretty uniforms.The little camp, with the stacks of guns down its
centre, the bayonets flashing in the last rays of the sun, was all
crowded and brilliant with happy people; looking into the tents and
admiring their exquisite order, inspecting the bright muskets, and
listening eagerly or good-humoredly, as they happened to be children or
grown people, to the explanations and comments of the Zouaves.And on the little grassy knoll, where the flag staff was planted,
central figure of the scene, stood Colonel Freddy, silent and thoughtful
for the first time to-day, with Jerry beside him.The old man had
scarcely left his side since the boy took the flag; he would permit no
one else to wait upon him at table, and his eyes followed him as he
moved among the gay crowd, with a glance of the utmost pride and
affection.The old volunteer seemed to feel that the heart of a soldier
beat beneath the little dandy ruffled shirt and gold-laced jacket of the
young Colonel.Suddenly, the boy snatches up again the regimental
colors; the Stars and Stripes, and little Jessie's flag, and shakes
them out to the evening breeze; and as they flash into view and once
more the cheers of the Zouaves greet their colors, he says, with
quivering lip and flashing eye, "Jerry, if God spares me to be a man,
I'll live and die a soldier!"The soft evening light was deepening into night, and the beautiful
planet Venus rising in the west, when the visitors bade adieu to the
camp; the Zouaves were shaken hands with until their wrists fairly
ached; and then they all shook hands with "dear" Jessie, as Charley was
heard to call her before the end of the day, and heard her say in her
soft little voice how sorry she was they must go to-morrow (though she
certainly couldn't have been sorrier than _they_ were), and then the
good people all got into their carriages again, and drove off; waving
their handkerchiefs for good-by as long as the camp could be seen; and
so, with the sound of the last wheels dying away in the distance, ended
the very end of

                                THE GRAND REVIEW.AND now, at last, had come that "day of disaster," when Camp McClellan
must be deserted.The very sun didn't shine so brilliantly as usual,
thought the Zouaves; and it was positively certain that the past five
days, although they had occurred in the middle of summer, were the very
shortest ever known!Eleven o'clock was the hour appointed for the
breaking up of the camp, in order that they might return to the city by
the early afternoon boat."Is it possible we have been here a week?"exclaimed Jimmy, as he sat
down to breakfast."It seems as if we had only come yesterday.""What a jolly time it has been!""I don't want
to go to Newport a bit."To Baltimore--but I don't mean to Secesh!"added Tom, with a little
blush."I have a cousin in the Palmetto Guards at Charleston, and that's
one too many rebels in the family."cried George Chadwick; "the Pringles are a first rate
family; the rest of you are loyal enough, I'm sure!"and George gave
Tom such a slap on the back, in token of his good will, that it quite
brought the tears into his eyes.When breakfast was over, the Zouaves repaired to their tents, and
proceeded to pack their clothes away out of the lockers.They were not
very scientific packers, and, in fact, the usual mode of doing the
business was to ram everything higgledy-piggledy into their valises, and
then jump on them until they consented to come together and be locked.Presently Jerry came trotting down with a donkey cart used on the farm,
and under his directions the boys folded their blankets neatly up, and
placed them in the vehicle, which then drove off with its load, leaving
them to get out and pile together the other furnishings of the tents;
for, of course, as soldiers, they were expected to wind up their own
affairs, and we all know that boys will do considerable _hard work_ when
it comes in the form of _play_.Just as the cart, with its vicious
little wrong-headed steed, had tugged, and jerked, and worried itself
out of sight, a light basket carriage, drawn by two dashing black
Canadian ponies, drew up opposite the camp, and the reins were let fall
by a young lady in a saucy "pork pie" straw hat, who was driving--no
other than Miss Carlton, with Jessie beside her.The boys eagerly
surrounded the little carriage, and Miss Carlton said, laughing, "Jessie
begged so hard for a last look at the camp, that I had to bring her."Really," repeated Freddy; "but I am so glad you came, Miss Jessie, just
in time to see us off.""You know soldiers take themselves away houses and all," said George;
"you will see the tents come down with a run presently."As he spoke, the donkey
cart rattled up, and Jerry, touching his cap to the ladies, got out, and
prepared to superintend the downfall of the tents.By his directions,
two of the Zouaves went to each tent, and pulled the stakes first from
one corner, then the other; then they grasped firmly the pole which
supported the centre, and when the sergeant ejaculated "Now!"the tents slid smoothly to the ground all at the same moment,
just as you may have made a row of blocks fall down by upsetting the
first one.And now came the last ceremony, the hauling down of the flag.shouted Jerry, and instantly a company was
detached, who brought the six little cannon under the flagstaff, and
charged them with the last of the double headers, saved for this
purpose; Freddy stood close to the flagstaff, with the halyards ready in
his hands.and the folds of the flag stream out proudly in the breeze, as it
rapidly descends the halyards, and flutters softly to the greensward.There was perfectly dead silence for a moment; then the voice of Mr.Schermerhorn was heard calling, "Come, boys, are you ready?Jump in,
then, it is time to start for the boat."The boys turned and saw the
carriages which had brought them so merrily to the camp waiting to
convey them once more to the wharf; while a man belonging to the farm
was rapidly piling the regimental luggage into a wagon.With sorrowful faces the Zouaves clustered around the pretty pony
chaise; shaking hands once more with Jessie, and internally vowing to
adore her as long as they lived.Then they got into the carriages, and
old Jerry grasped Freddy's hand with an affectionate "Good-by, my little
Colonel, God bless ye!Old Jerry won't never forget your noble face as
long as he lives."It would have seemed like insulting the old man to
offer him money in return for his loving admiration, but the handsome
gilt-edged Bible that found its way to him soon after the departure of
the regiment, was inscribed with the irregular schoolboy signature of
"Freddy Jourdain, with love to his old friend Jeremiah Pike."As for the regimental standards, they were found to be rather beyond
the capacity of a rockaway crammed full of Zouaves, so Tom insisted on
riding on top of the baggage, that he might have the pleasure of
carrying them all the way.Up he mounted, as brisk as a lamplighter,
with that monkey, Peter, after him, the flags were handed up, and with
three ringing cheers, the vehicles started at a rapid trot, and the
regiment was fairly off.They almost broke their necks leaning back to
see the last of "dear Jessie," until the locusts hid them from sight,
when they relapsed into somewhat dismal silence for full five minutes.As Peter was going on to Niagara with his father, Mr.Schermerhorn
accompanied the regiment to the city, which looked dustier and red
brickier (what a word!)than ever, now that they were fresh from the
lovely green of the country.Schermerhorn's advice, the party
took possession of two empty Fifth avenue stages which happened to be
waiting at the Fulton ferry, and rode slowly up Broadway to Chambers
street, where Peter and his father bid them good-by, and went off to the
depot.As Peter had declined changing his clothes before he left, they
had to travel all the way to Buffalo with our young friend in this
unusual guise; but, as people had become used to seeing soldiers
parading about in uniform, they didn't seem particularly surprised,
whereat Master Peter was rather disappointed.To go back to the Zouaves, however.When the stages turned into Fifth
avenue, they decided to get out; and after forming their ranks in fine
style, they marched up the avenue, on the sidewalk this time, stopping
at the various houses or street corners where they must bid adieu to one
and another of their number, promising to see each other again as soon
as possible.At last only Tom and Freddy were left to go home by themselves.As they
marched along, keeping faultless step, Freddy exclaimed, "I tell you
what, Tom!I mean to ask my father, the minute he comes home, to let me
go to West Point as soon as I leave school!I must be a soldier--I
can't think of anything else!""That's just what I mean to do!"cried Tom, with sparkling eyes; "and,
Fred, if you get promoted before me, promise you will have me in your
regiment, won't you?"answered Freddy; "but you're the oldest, Tom,
and, you know, the oldest gets promoted first; so mind you don't forget
me when you come to your command!"As he spoke, they reached his own home; and our hero, glad after all to
come back to father, mother, and sister, bounded up the steps, and rang
the bell good and _hard_, just to let Joseph know that a personage of
eminence had arrived.As the door opened, he turned gayly round, cap in
hand, saying, "Good-by, Maryland; you've left the regiment, but you'll
never leave the Union!"and the last words he heard Tom say were, "No,
by George, _never_!"*       *       *       *       *

And now, dear little readers, my boy friends in particular, the history
of Freddy Jourdain must close.He still lives in New York, and attends
Dr.Larned's school, where he is at the head of all his classes.The Dashahed Zouaves have met very often since the encampment, and had
many a good drill in their room--the large attic floor which Mr.Jourdain allowed them for their special accommodation, and where the
beautiful regimental colors are carefully kept, to be proudly displayed
in every parade of the Zouaves.When he is sixteen, the boy Colonel is to enter West Point Academy, and
learn to be a real soldier; while Tom--poor Tom, who went down to
Baltimore that pleasant July month, promising so faithfully to join
Freddy in the cadet corps, may never see the North again.And in conclusion let me say, that should our country again be in danger
in after years, which God forbid, we may be sure that first in the
field, and foremost in the van of the grand army, will be our gallant
young friend,

                                 COLONEL FREDDY.IT took a great many Saturday afternoons to finish the story of "Colonel
Freddy," and the children returned to it at each reading with renewed
and breathless interest.George and Helen couldn't help jumping up off
their seats once or twice and clapping their hands with delight when
anything specially exciting took place in the pages of the wonderful
story that was seen "before it was printed," and a great many "oh's" and
"ah's" testified to their appreciation of the gallant "Dashahed
Zouaves."They laughed over the captive Tom, and cried over the true
story of the old sergeant; and when at length the very last word had
been read, and their mother had laid down the manuscript, George sprang
up once more, exclaiming; "Oh, I wish I could be a boy soldier!Mamma,
mayn't I recruit a regiment and camp out too?"cried his sister; "I wish I had been Jessie; what a
pity it wasn't all true!""And what if I should tell you," said their mother, laughing, "that a
little bird has whispered in my ear that 'Colonel Freddy' was
wonderfully like your little Long Island friend Hilton R----?""Oh, something funny I heard about him last summer; never mind what!"The children wisely concluded that it was no use to ask any more
questions; at the same moment solemnly resolving that the very next time
they paid a visit to their aunt, who lived at Astoria, they would beg
her to let them drive over to Mr.R----'s place, and find out all about
it.After this, there were no more readings for several Saturdays; but at
last one morning when the children had almost given up all hopes of more
stories, George opened his eyes on the sock hanging against the door,
which looked more bulgy than ever.he shouted; "Aunt Fanny's
daughter hasn't forgotten us, after all!"and dressing himself in a
double quick, helter-skelter fashion, George dashed out into the entry,
forgot his good resolution, and slid down the banisters like a streak of
lightning and began pummelling on his sister's door with both fists;
shouting, "Come, get up!here's another Sock story for
us!"This delightful announcement was quite sufficient to make Helen's
stockings, which she was just drawing on in a lazy fashion, fly up to
their places in a hurry; then she popped her button-over boots on the
wrong feet, and had to take them off and try again; and, in short, the
whole of her dressing was an excellent illustration of that time-honored
maxim, "The more _haste_, the worse _speed_;" George, meanwhile,
performing a distracted Indian war dance in the entry outside, until his
father opened his door and wanted to know what the racket was all about.At this moment Helen came out, and the two children scampered down
stairs, and sitting down side by side on the sofa, they proceeded to
examine this second instalment of the Sock stories.They found it was
again a whole book; and the title, on a little page by itself, read
"GERMAN SOCKS.""These must be more stories like that
dear 'Little White Angel.'"And so they proved to be; for, on their mother's commencing to read the
first story, it was found to be called, "God's Pensioners;" and
commenced, "It was a cold--" but stop!This book was to be devoted
to "Colonel Freddy;" but if you will only go to Mr.Leavitt's, the
publishers, you will there discover what was the rest of the second Sock
Stories.*       *       *       *       *

CONSUMPTION CURED.An old physician, retired from practice, having had placed in his hands by
an East India missionary the formula of a simple vegetable remedy for the
speedy and permanent cure of Consumption, Bronchitis, Catarrh, Asthma and

Nervous Debility and all Nervous Complaints, after having tested its
wonderful curative powers in thousands of cases, has felt it his duty to
make it known to his suffering fellows.Actuated by this motive and a

two tiny new twin babes.He looked reflectively from one to the other for
a minute or two, then, poking his chubby finger into the plumpest baby, he
said decidedly, "Save this one."In promulgating your esoteric cogitation on articulating superficial
sentimentalities and philosophical psychological observation, beware of
platitudinous ponderosity.Let your conversation possess a clarified
conciseness, compact comprehensiveness, coalescent consistency, and a
concatenated cognancy; eschew all conglomerations of flatulent garrulity
and jejune babblement.In other words, don't use such big words.A boy once took it in his head
  That he would exercise his sled.He took the sled into the road
  And, lord a massy!And as he slid, he laughing cried,
  "What fun upon my sled to slide."And as he laughed, before he knewed,
  He from that sliding sled was slude.Upon the slab where he was laid

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Prairie Farmer, Vol.It is easily forgotten that Luther desired the execution of
a rationalist, and that Calvin did burn a Socinian.The furious language
of Protestants against Rome, and of Presbyterians against the English
Church, is considered even heroic, like the invective ascribed to
Christ, "Generation of vipers, how can you escape the damnation of
hell!"Although vehement language grates on the ear of an age that
understands the real forces of evolution, the historic sense remembers
that moral revolutions have been made with words hard as cannon-balls.It was only when soft phrases about the evil of slavery, which
"would pass away in God's good time," made way for the abolitionist
denunciation of the Constitution as "an agreement with hell," that the
fortress began to fall.In other words, reforms are wrought by those who
are in earnest.* It is difficult in our time to place one's self in
the situation of a heretic of Paine's time.Darwin, who is buried
in Westminster, remembered the imprisonment of some educated men for
opinions far less heretical than his own.egoistic insanity
appears (1892) to have been inherited by an imperial descendant, and
should Germans be presently punished for their religion, as Paine's
early followers were in England, we shall again hear those words that
are the "half-battles" preceding victories.* "In writing upon this, as upon every other subject, I
     speak a language plain and intelligible.I deal not in hints
     and intimations.I have several reasons for this: first,
     that I may be clearly understood; secondly, that it may be
     seen I am in earnest; and thirdly, because it is an affront
     to truth to treat falsehood with complaisance."--Paine's
     reply to Bishop Watson.There is even greater difficulty in the appreciation by one generation
of the inner sense of the language of a past one.The common notion
that Paines "Age of Reason" abounds in "vulgarity" is due to the lack
of literary culture in those--probably few--who have derived that
impression from its perusal.It is the fate of all genius potent enough
to survive a century that its language will here and there seem coarse.The thoughts of Boccaccio, Rabelais, Shakespeare,--whose works are
commonly expurgated,--are so modern that they are not generally granted
the allowances conceded to writers whose ideas are as antiquated as
their words.Only the instructed minds can set their classic nudities in
the historic perspective that reveals their innocency and value.Paine's
book has done as much to modify human belief as any ever written.It is
one of the very few religious works of the last century which survives
in unsectarian circulation.It requires a scholarly perception to
recognize in its occasional expressions, by some called "coarse," the
simple Saxon of Nor-folkshire.Similar expressions abound in pious
books of the time; they are not censured, because they are not read.Priestley--found no
fault with Paine's words, though the former twice accuses his assertions
as "indecent."In both cases, however, Paine is pointing out some
biblical triviality or indecency--or what he conceived such.I have
before me original editions of both Parts of the "Age of Reason" printed
from Paine's manuscripts.Part First may be read by the most prudish
parent to a daughter, without an omission.In Part Second six or seven
sentences might be omitted by the parent, where the writer deals,
without the least prurience, with biblical narratives that can hardly be
daintily touched.Paine would have been astounded at the suggestion of
any impropriety in his expressions.He passes over four-fifths of the
passages in the Bible whose grossness he might have cited in support of
his objection to its immorality."Obscenity," he says, "in matters of
faith, however wrapped up, is always a token of fable and imposture; for
it is necessary to our serious belief in God that we do not connect it
with stories that run, as this does, into ludicrous interpretations.The
story [of the miraculous conception] is, upon the face of it, the same
kind of story as that of Jupiter and Leda."By R. Llandaff" [Dr.Another fostered prejudice supposes "The Age of Reason" largely made up
of scoffs.The Bishop of Llandaff, in his reply to Paine, was impressed
by the elevated Theism of the work, to portions of which he ascribed
"a philosophical sublimity."Watson apparently tried to constrain
his ecclesiastical position into English fair play, so that his actual
failures to do so were especially misleading, as many knew Paine only as
represented by this eminent antagonist.For instance, the Bishop says,
"Moses you term a coxcomb, etc."But Paine, commenting on Numbers xii.,
3, "Moses was very meek, above all men," had argued that Moses could
not have written the book, for "If Moses said this of himself he was a
coxcomb."Again the Bishop says Paine terms Paul "a fool."But Paine had
quoted from Paul, "'Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened
except it die.'To which [he says] one might reply in his own language,
and say, 'Thou fool, Paul, that which thou sowest is not quickened
except it die not.'"No intellect that knows the law of literature, that deep answers only
unto deep, can suppose that the effect of Paine's "Age of Reason," on
which book the thirty years' war for religious freedom in England was
won, after many martyrdoms, came from a scoffing or scurrilous work.It
is never Paine's object to raise a laugh; if he does so it is because
of the miserable baldness of the dogmas, and the ignorant literalism,
consecrated in the popular mind of his time.Through page after page he
peruses the Heavens, to him silently declaring the glory of God, and it
is not laughter but awe when he asks, "From whence then could arise the
solitary and strange conceit, that the Almighty, who had millions of
worlds equally dependent on his protection, should quit the care of all
the rest, and come to die in our world, because, they say, one man and
one woman had eaten an apple!"In another work Paine finds allegorical truth in the legend of Eden.The
comparative mythlogists of to-day, with many sacred books of the East,
can find mystical meaning and beauty in many legends of the Bible
wherein Paine could see none, but it is because of their liberation by
the rebels of last century from bondage to the pettiness of literalism.Paine sometimes exposes an absurdity with a taste easily questionable by
a generation not required like his own to take such things under foot
of the letter.But his spirit is never flippant, and the sentences that
might so seem to a casual reader are such as Browning defended in his
"Christmas Eve.""If any blames me,
     Thinking that merely to touch in brevity
     The topics I dwell on, were unlawful--
     Or, worse, that I trench, with undue levity,
     On the bounds of the Holy and the awful,
     I praise the heart, and pity the head of him,
     And refer myself to Thee, instead of him;
     Who head and heart alike discernest,
     Looking below light speech we utter,
     When the frothy spume and frequent sputter
     Prove that the soul's depths boil in earnest!"James Martineau, whose reverential spirit no one can question,
once raised a smile in his audience, of which the present writer was
one, by saying that the account of the temptation of Jesus, if true,
must have been reported by himself, or "by the only other party
present."Any allusion to the devil in our day excites a smile.But it
was not so in Paine's day, when many crossed themselves while speaking
of this dark prince.Paine has "too much respect for the moral character
of Christ" to suppose that he told the story of the devil showing him
all the kingdoms of the world."How happened it that he did not discover
America; or is it only with kingdoms that his sooty highness has any
interest?"This is not flippancy; it was by following the inkstand
Luther threw at the devil with equally vigorous humor that the grotesque
figure was eliminated, leaving the reader of to-day free to appreciate
the profound significance of the Temptation.How free Paine is from any disposition to play to pit or gallery, any
more than to dress circle, is shown in his treatment of the Book of
Jonah.It is not easy to tell the story without exciting laughter;
indeed the proverbial phrases for exaggeration,--"a whale," a "fish
story,"--probably came from Jonah.He says,
"it would have approached nearer to the idea of a miracle if Jonah had
swallowed the whale"; but this is merely in passing to an argument that
miracles, in the early world, would hardly have represented Divinity.Had the fish cast up Jonah in the streets of Nineveh the people would
probably have been affrighted, and fancied them both devils.But in the
second Part of the work there is a very impressive treatment of the Book
of Jonah.This too is introduced with a passing smile--"if credulity
could swallow Jonah and the whale it could swallow anything."But it
is precisely to this supposed "scoffer" that we owe the first
interpretation of the profound and pathetic significance of the book,
lost sight of in controversies about its miracle.Paine anticipates Baur
in pronouncing it a poetical work of Gentile origin.He finds in it the
same lesson against intolerance contained in the story of the reproof of
Abraham for piously driving the suffering fire-worshipper from his tent.(This story is told by the Persian Saadi, who also refers to Jonah: "And
now the whale swallowed Jonah: the sun set.")In the prophet mourning
for his withered gourd, while desiring the destruction of a city, Paine
finds a satire; in the divine rebuke he hears the voice of a true
God, and one very different from the deity to whom the Jews ascribed
massacres.The same critical acumen is shown in his treatment of the
Book of Job, which he believes to be also of Gentile origin, and much
admires.The large Paine Mythology cleared aside, he who would learn the
truth about this religious teacher will find in his way a misleading
literature of uncritical eulogies.Indeed the pious prejudices against
Paine have largely disappeared, as one may see by comparing the earlier
with the later notices of him in religious encyclopaedias.But though he
is no longer placed in an infernal triad as in the old hymn--"The world,
the devil, and Tom Paine"--and his political services are now candidly
recognized, he is still regarded as the propagandist of a bald
illiterate deism.This, which is absurdly unhistorical, Paine having
been dealt with by eminent critics of his time as an influence among the
educated, is a sequel to his long persecution.For he was relegated to
the guardianship of an unlearned and undiscriminating radicalism, little
able to appreciate the niceties of his definitions, and was gilded by
its defensive commonplaces into a figurehead.Paine therefore has now
to be saved from his friends more perhaps than from his enemies.It has
been shown on a former page that his governmental theories were of a
type peculiar in his time.Though such writers as Spencer, Frederic
Harrison, Bagehot, and Dicey have familiarized us with his ideas, few of
them have the historic perception which enables Sir George Trevelyan
to recognize Paine's connection with them.It must now be added that
Paine's religion was of a still more peculiar type.He cannot be classed
with deists of the past or theists of the present.Instead of being
the mere iconoclast, the militant assailant of Christian beliefs, the
"infidel" of pious slang, which even men who should know better suppose,
he was an exact thinker, a slow and careful writer, and his religious
ideas, developed through long years, require and repay study.The dedication of "The Age of Reason" places the work under the
"protection" of its authors fellow-citizens of the United States.To-day
the trust comes to many who really are such as Paine supposed all of his
countrymen to be,--just and independent lovers of truth and right.We shall see that his trust was not left altogether unfulfilled by
a multitude of his contemporaries, though they did not venture to do
justice to the man.Paine had idealized his countrymen, looking from
his prison across three thousand miles.But, to that vista of space, a
century of time had to be added before the book which fanatical Couthon
suppressed, and the man whom murderous Barrere sentenced to death, could
both be fairly judged by educated America."The Age of Reason" is in two Parts, published in successive years.These divisions are interesting as memorials of the circumstances
under which they were written and published,--in both cases with death
evidently at hand.But taking the two Parts as one work, there appears
to my own mind a more real division: a part written by Paine's century,
and another originating from himself.Each of these has an important and
traceable evolution.I. The first of these divisions may be considered, fundementally, as
a continuation of the old revolution against arbitrary authority.Carlyle's humor covers a profound insight when he remarks that Paine,
having freed America with his "Common Sense," was resolved to free this
whole world, and perhaps the other!All the authorities were and are
interdependent."If thou release this man thou art not Caesar's friend,"
cried the Priest to Pilate.The proconsul must face the fact that in
Judea Caesarism rests on the same foundation with Jahvism.Authority
leans on authority; none can stand alone.It is still a question whether
political revolutions cause or are caused by religious revolutions.Buckle maintained that the French Revolution was chiefly due to the
previous overthrow of spiritual authority; Rocquain, that the political
_regime_ was shaken before the philosophers arose.* In England religious
changes seem to have usually followed those of a political character,
not only in order of time, but in character.In beginning the "Age of
Reason," Paine says:

     * Felix Rocquain's fine work,  L'Esprit revolutionnaire
     avant la Revolution," though not speculative, illustrates
     the practical nature of revolution,--an uncivilized and
     often retrograde form of evolution."Soon after I had published the pamphlet 'Common Sense' in America I saw
the exceeding probability that a revolution in the system of government
would be followed by a revolution in the system of religion.The
adulterous connection of church and state, wherever it had taken place,
whether Jewish, Christian, or Turkish, had so effectually prohibited by
pains and penalties every discussion upon established creeds, and upon
first principles of religion, that until the system of government should
be changed those subjects could not be brought fairly and openly before
the world; but that whenever this should be done a revolution in the
system of religion would follow.Human inventions and priestcraft
would be detected; and man would return to the pure, unmixed, and
unadulterated belief of one God and no more."The historical continuity of the critical negations of Paine with the
past is represented in his title.The Revolution of 1688,--the secular
arm transferring the throne from one family to another,--brought the
monarchical superstition into doubt; straightway the Christian authority
was shaken.One hundred years before Paine's book, appeared Charles Blount's
"Oracles of Reason."Macaulay describes Blount as the head of a small
school of "infidels," troubled with a desire to make converts; his
delight was to worry the priests by asking them how light existed before
the sun was made, and where Eve found thread to stitch her fig-leaves.But to this same Blount, Macaulay is constrained to attribute
emancipation of the press in England.Blount's title was taken up in America by Ethan Allen, leader of the
"Green Mountain Boys."Allen's "Oracles of Reason" is forgotten; he is
remembered by his demand (1775) for the surrender of Fort Ticonderoga,
"in the name of Jehovah and the Continental Congress."The last five
words of this famous demand would have been a better title for the
book.It introduces the nation to a Jehovah qualified by the
Continental Congress.Ethan Allen's deity is no longer a King of kings:
arbitrariness has disappeared; men are summoned to belief in a governor
administering laws inherent in the constitution of a universe co-eternal
with himself, and with which he is interdependent.His administration
is not for any divine glory, but, in anticipation of our constitutional
preamble, to "promote the general welfare."The old Puritan alteration
in the Lord's Prayer, "Thy Commonwealth come!"would in Allen's church
have been "Thy Republic come!"That is, had he admitted prayer, which
to an Executive is of course out of place.It must not, however, be
supposed that Ethan Allen is conscious that his system is inspired
by the Revolution.His book is a calm, philosophical analysis of New
England theology and metaphysics; an attempt to clear away the ancient
biblical science and set Newtonian science in its place; to found what
he conceives "Natural Religion."In editing his "Account of Arnold's Campaign in Quebec," John Joseph
Henry says in a footnote that Paine borrowed from Allen.But the aged
man was, in his horror of Paine's religion, betrayed by his memory.The
only connection between the books runs above the consciousness of either
writer.There was necessarily some resemblance between negations dealing
with the same narratives, but a careful comparison of the books leaves
me doubtful whether Paine ever read Allen.His title may have been
suggested by Blount, whose "Oracles of Reason" was in the library of
his assistant at Bor-dentown, John Hall.The works are distinct in aim,
products of different religious climes.Allen is occupied mainly with
the metaphysical, Paine with quite other, aspects of their common
subject.There is indeed a conscientious originality in the freethinkers
who successively availed themselves of the era of liberty secured by
Blount.Collins, Bolingbroke, Hume, Toland, Chubb, Woolston, Tindal,
Middleton, Annet, Gibbon,--each made an examination for himself, and
represents a distinct chapter in the religious history of England.Annet's "Free Inquirer," aimed at enlightenment of the lower classes,
proved that free thought was tolerated only as an aristocratic
privilege; the author was pilloried, just thirty years before the
cheapening of the "Rights of Man" led to Paine's prosecution.Probably
Morgan did more than any of the deists to prepare English ground for
Paine's sowing, by severely criticising the Bible by a standard
of civilized ethics, so far as ethics were civilized in the early
eighteenth century.But none of these writers touched the deep chord of
religious feeling in, the people.The English-speaking people were timid
about venturing too much on questions which divided the learned, and
were content to express their protest against the worldliness of the
Church and faithlessness to the lowly Saviour, by following pietists and
enthusiasts.The learned clergy, generally of the wealthy classes, were
largely deistical, but conservative.They gradually perceived that the
political and the theological authority rested on the same foundation.So between the deists and the Christians there was, as Leslie Stephen
says, a "comfortable compromise, which held together till Wesley from
one side, and Thomas Paine from another, forced more serious thoughts on
the age."*

     * "History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century."While "The Age of Reason" is thus, in one aspect, the product of its
time, the renewal of an old siege--begun far back indeed as Celsus,--its
intellectual originality is none the less remarkable.Paine is
more complete master of the comparative method than Tindal in his
"Christianity as old as the Creation."In his studies of "Christian
Mythology" (his phrase), one is surprised by anticipations of Baur
and Strauss.These are all the more striking by reason of his
homely illustrations.Thus, in discussing the liabilities of ancient
manuscripts to manipulation, he mentions in his second Part that in the
first, printed less than two years before, there was already a sentence
he never wrote; and contrasts this with the book of nature wherein
no blade of grass can be imitated or altered.* He distinguishes the
historical Jesus from the mythical Christ with nicety, though none had
previously done this.He is more discriminating than the early deists
in his explanations of the scriptural marvels which he discredits.There
was not the invariable alternative of imposture with which the orthodoxy
of his time had been accustomed to deal.He does indeed suspect Moses
with his rod of conjuring, and thinks no better of those who pretended
knowledge of future events; but the incredible narratives are
traditions, fables, and occasionally "downright lies."* The sentence imported into Paine's Part First is: "The
     book of Luke was carried by one voice only."I find the
     words added as a footnote in the Philadelphia edition, 1794,
     p.While Paine in Paris was utilizing the ascent of the
     footnote to his text, Dr.Priestley in Pennsylvania was
     using it to show Paine's untrustworthiness.("Letters to a
     Philosophical Unbeliever," p.But it would appear,
     though neither discovered it, that Paine's critic was the
     real offender.In quoting the page, before answering it,
     Priestley incorporated in the text the footnote of an
     American editor.Priestley could not of course imagine such
     editorial folly, but all the same the reader may here see
     the myth-insect already building the Paine Mythology."It is not difficult to discover the progress by which even simple
supposition, with the aid of credulity, will in time grow into a lie,
and at last be told as a fact; and wherever we can find a charitable
reason for a thing of this kind we ought not to indulge a severe one."Paine's use of the word "lies" in this connection is an archaism.Carlyle told me that his father always spoke of such tales as "The
Arabian Nights" as "downright lies"; by which he no doubt meant fables
without any indication of being such, and without any moral.Elsewhere
Paine uses "lie" as synonymous with "fabulous"; when he means by the
word what it would now imply, "wilful" is prefixed.In the Gospels he
finds "inventions" of Christian Mythologists--tales founded on
vague rumors, relics of primitive works of imagination mistaken for
history,--fathered upon disciples who did not write them.His treatment of the narrative of Christ's resurrection may be selected
as an example of his method.He rejects Paul's testimony, and his five
hundred witnesses to Christ's reappearance, because the evidence did not
convince Paul himself, until he was struck by lightning, or otherwise
converted.He finds disagreements in the narratives of the gospels,
concerning the resurrection, which, while proving there was no concerted
imposture, show that the accounts were not written by witnesses of the
events; for in this case they would agree more nearly.He finds in the
narratives of Christ's reappearances,--"suddenly coming in and going out
when doors are shut, vanishing out of sight and appearing again,"--and
the lack of details, as to his dress, etc., the familiar signs of a
ghost-story, which is apt to be told in different ways."Stories of this
kind had been told of the assassination of Julius Caesar, not many years
before, and they generally have their origin in violent deaths, or in
the execution of innocent persons.In cases of this kind compassion
lends its aid, and benevolently stretches the story.It goes on a little
and a little further, till it becomes a most certain truth.Once start
a ghost, and credulity fills up its life and assigns the cause of its
appearance."The moral and religious importance of the resurrection
would thus be an afterthought.The secrecy and privacy of the alleged
appearances of Christ after death are, he remarks, repugnant to the
supposed end of convincing the world.*

     * In 1778 Lessing set forth his "New Hypothesis of the
     Evangelists," that they had independently built on a basis
     derived from some earlier Gospel of the Hebrews,--a theory
     now confirmed by the recovered fragments of that lost
     Memoir, collected by Dr.It is tolerably certain that Paine was unacquainted with
     Lessing's work, when he became convinced, by variations in
     the accounts of the resurrection, that some earlier
     narrative "became afterwards the foundation of the four
     books ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,"--these
     being, traditionally eye-witnesses.Paine admits the power of the deity to make a revelation.He therefore
deals with each of the more notable miracles on its own evidence,
adhering to his plan of bringing the Bible to judge the Bible.Such an
investigation, written with lucid style and quaint illustration, without
one timid or uncandid sentence, coming from a man whose services and
sacrifices for humanity were great, could not have failed to give the
"Age of Reason" long life, even had these been its only qualities.Four
years before the book appeared, Burke said in Parliament: "Who, born
within the last forty years, has read one word of Collins, and
Toland, and Tindal, and Chubb, and Morgan, and the whole race who call
themselves freethinkers?"Paine was, in one sense, of this intellectual
pedigree; and had his book been only a digest and expansion of previous
negative criticisms, and a more thorough restatement of theism, these
could have given it but a somewhat longer life; the "Age of Reason" must
have swelled Burke's list of forgotten freethinking books.But there was
an immortal soul in Paine's book.It is to the consideration of this its
unique life, which has defied the darts of criticism for a century, and
survived its own faults and limitations, that we now turn.Paine's book is the uprising of the human heart against the
Religion of Inhumanity.This assertion may be met with a chorus of denials that there was, or
is, in Christendom any Religion of Inhumanity.And, if Thomas Paine is
enjoying the existence for which he hoped, no heavenly anthem would
be such music in his ears as a chorus of stormiest denials from earth
reporting that the Religion of Inhumanity is so extinct as to be
incredible.Nevertheless, the Religion of Inhumanity did exist, and
it defended against Paine a god of battles, of pomp, of wrath; an
instigator of race hatreds and exterminations; an establisher of
slavery; a commander of massacres in punishment of theological beliefs;
a sender of lying spirits to deceive men, and of destroying angels to
afflict them with plagues; a creator of millions of human beings under
a certainty of their eternal torture by devils and fires of his own
creation.This apotheosis of Inhumanity is here called a religion,
because it managed to survive from the ages of savagery by violence of
superstition, to gain a throne in the Bible by killing off all who did
not accept its authority to the letter, and because it was represented
by actual inhumanities.The great obstruction of Science and
Civilization was that the Bible was quoted in sanction of war, crusades
against alien religions, murders for witchcraft, divine right of
despots, degradation of reason, exaltation of credulity, punishment of
opinion and unbiblical discovery, contempt of human virtues and human
nature, and costly ceremonies before an invisible majesty, which,
exacted from the means of the people, were virtually the offering of
human sacrifices.There had been murmurs against this consecrated Inhumanity through the
ages, dissentients here and there; but the Revolution began with Paine.He was just the one man in the world who had
undergone the training necessary for this particular work.The higher clergy, occupied with the old textual controversy, proudly
instructing Paine in Hebrew or Greek idioms, little realized their
ignorance in the matter now at issue.Their ignorance had been too
carefully educated to even imagine the University in which words are
things, and things the word, and the many graduations passed between
Thetford Quaker meeting and the French Convention.What to scholastics,
for whom humanities meant ancient classics, were the murders and
massacres of primitive tribes, declared to be the word and work of God?But Paine had seen that
war-god at his work.In childhood he had seen the hosts of the Defender
of the Faith as, dripping with the blood of Culloden and Inverness, they
marched through Thetford; in manhood he had seen the desolations wrought
"by the grace of" that deity to the royal invader of America; he
had seen the massacres ascribed to Jahve repeated in France, while
Robespierre and Couthon were establishing worship of an infra-human
deity.By sorrow, poverty, wrong, through long years, amid revolutions
and death-agonies, the stay-maker's needle had been forged into a pen of
lightning.No Oxonian conductor could avert that stroke, which was
not at mere irrationalities, but at a huge idol worshipped with human
sacrifices.The creation of the heart of Paine, historically traceable,
is so wonderful, its outcome seems so supernatural, that in earlier ages
he might have been invested with fable, like some Avatar.Of some such
man, no doubt, the Hindu poets dreamed in their picture of young Arguna
(in the _Bhagavatgita_).The warrior, borne to the battlefield in his
chariot, finds arrayed against him his kinsmen, friends, preceptors.He bids his charioteer pause; he cannot fight those he loves.His
charioteer turns: 't is the radiant face of divine Chrishna, his
Saviour!Even He has led him to this grievous contention with kinsmen,
and those to whose welfare he was devoted.Chrishna instructs his
disciple that the war is an illusion; it is the conflict by which,
from age to age, the divine life in the world is preserved."This
imperishable devotion I declared to the sun, the sun delivered it to
Manu, Manu to Ikshaku; handed down from one to another it was studied by
the royal sages.In the lapse of time that devotion was lost.It is even
the same discipline which I this day communicate to thee, for thou
art my servant and my friend.Both thou and I have passed through many
births.Mine are known to me; thou knowest not of thine.I am made
evident by my own power: as often as there is a decline of virtue, and
an insurrection of wrong and injustice in the world, I appear."Paine could not indeed know his former births; and, indeed, each former
self of his--Wycliffe, Fox, Roger Williams--was sectarianized beyond
recognition.He could hardly see kinsmen in the Unitarians, who were
especially eager to disown the heretic affiliated on them by opponents;
nor in the Wesleyans, though in him was the blood of their apostle, who
declared salvation a present life, free to all.In a profounder sense,
Paine was George Fox.Here was George Fox disowned, freed from his
accidents, naturalized in the earth and humanized in the world of men.Paine is explicable only by the intensity of his Quakerism, consuming
its own traditions as once the church's ceremonies and sacraments.On
him, in Thetford meeting-house, rolled the burden of that Light that
enlighteneth every man, effacing distinctions of rank, race, sex, making
all equal, clearing away privilege, whether of priest or mediator,
subjecting all scriptures to its immediate illumination.This faith was a fearful heritage to carry, even in childhood, away from
the Quaker environment which, by mixture with modifying "survivals," in
habit and doctrine, cooled the fiery gospel for the average tongue.The intermarriage of Paine's father with a family in the English Church
brought the precocious boy's Light into early conflict with his kindred,
his little lamp being still fed in the meeting-house.A child brought up
without respect for the conventional symbols of religion, or even with
pious antipathy to them, is as if born with only one spiritual skin; he
will bleed at a touch."I well remember, when about seven or eight years of age, hearing
a sermon read by a relation of mine, who was a great devotee of the
Church, upon the subject of what is called _redemption by the death of
the Son of God_.After the sermon was ended I went into the garden,
and as I was going down the garden steps, (for I perfectly remember the
spot), I revolted at the recollection of what I had heard, and thought
to myself that it was making God Almighty act like a passionate man,
that killed his son when he could not revenge himself in any other way;
and, as I was sure a man would be hanged that did such a thing, I could
not see for what purpose they preached such sermons.This was not one of
that kind of thoughts that had anything in it of childish levity; it was
to me a serious reflection, arising from the idea I had, that God was
too good to do such an action, and also too almighty to be under any
necessity of doing it.I believe in the same manner at this moment; and
I moreover believe that any system of religion that has anything in it
which shocks the mind of a child, cannot be a true system."The child took his misgivings out into the garden; he would not by a
denial shock his aunt Cocke's faith as his own had been shocked.For
many years he remained silent in his inner garden, nor ever was drawn
out of it until he found the abstract dogma of the death of God's Son an
altar for sacrificing men, whom he reverenced as all God's sons.What he
used to preach at Dover and Sandwich cannot now be known.His ignorance
of Greek and Latin, the scholastic "humanities," had prevented his
becoming a clergyman, and introduced him to humanities of another kind.His mission was then among the poor and ignorant.*

     * "Old John Berry, the late Col.Hay's servant, told me he
     knew Paine very well when he was at Dover--had heard him
     preach there--thought him a staymaker by trade."--W.Weedon,
     of Glynde, quoted in Notes and Queries (London), December
     29, 1866.Sixteen years later he is in Philadelphia, attending the English Church,
in which he had been confirmed.There were many deists in that Church,
whose laws then as now were sufficiently liberal to include them.In his
"Common Sense" (published January 10, 1776) Paine used the reproof of
Israel (I. Samuel) for desiring a King.John Adams, a Unitarian and
monarchist, asked him if he really believed in the inspiration of the
Old Testament.Paine said he did not, and intended at a later period to
publish his opinions on the subject.There was nothing inconsistent in
Paine's believing that a passage confirmed by his own Light was a
divine direction, though contained in a book whose alleged inspiration
throughout he did not accept.Before
that, soon after his arrival in the country, when he found African
Slavery supported by the Old Testament, Paine had repudiated the
authority of that book; he declares it abolished by "Gospel light,"
which includes man-stealing among the greatest crimes.When, a year
later, on the eve of the Revolution, he writes "Common Sense," he has
another word to say about religion, and it is strictly what the human
need of the hour demands.Whatever his disbeliefs, he could never
sacrifice human welfare to them, any more than he would, suffer dogmas
to sacrifice the same.It would have been a grievous sacrifice of the
great cause of republican independence, consequently, of religious
liberty, had he introduced a theological controversy at the moment
when it was of vital importance that the sects should rise above their
partition-walls and unite for a great common end.The Quakers, deistical
as they were, preserved religiously the separatism once compulsory; and
Paine proved himself the truest Friend among them when he was "moved"
by the Spirit of Humanity, for him at length the Holy Spirit, to utter
(1776) his brave cheer for Catholicity."As to religion, I hold it to be the indispensable duty of all
governments to protect all conscientious professors thereof, and I know
of no other business which government hath to do therewith.Let a man
throw aside that narrowness of soul, that selfishness of principle,
which the niggards of all professions are so unwilling to part with, and
he will be at once delivered of his fears on that head.Suspicion is the
companion of mean souls, and the bane of all good society.For myself,
I fully and conscientiously believe, that it is the will of the Almighty
that there should be a diversity of religious opinions amongst us: it
affords a larger field for our Christian kindness.Were we all of
one way of thinking, our religious dispositions would want matter
for probation; and, on this liberal principle, I look on the various
denominations among us to be like children of the same family, differing
only in what is called their Christian names."There was no pedantry whatever about Paine, this obedient son of
Humanity.He would defend Man against men, against sects and parties;
he would never quarrel about the botanical label of a tree bearing such
fruits as the Declaration of Independence.But no man better knew the
power of words, and that a botanical error may sometimes result in
destructive treatment of the tree.For this reason he censured the
Quakers for opposing the Revolution on the ground that, in the words
of their testimony (1776), "the setting up and putting down kings and
governments is God's peculiar prerogative."Kings, he answers, are not
removed by miracles, but by just such means as the Americans were using.Charles, then, died not by the hands of
man; and should the present proud imitator of him come to the same
untimely end, the writers and publishers of the Testimony are bound, by
the doctrine it contains, to applaud the fact."In his "Epistle to Quakers" he speaks of the
dispersion of the Jews as "foretold by our Saviour."In his famous first
_Crisis_ he exhorts the Americans not to throw "the burden of the day
upon Providence, but'show your faith by your works,' that God may bless
you."For in those days there was visible to such eyes as his, as to
anti-slavery eyes in our civil war,

     "A fiery Gospel writ in burnished rows of steel."The Republic, not American but Human, became Paine's religion."Divine
Providence intends this country to be the asylum of persecuted
virtue from every quarter of the globe."So he had written before the
Declaration of Independence.In 1778 he finds that there still survives
some obstructive superstition among English churchmen in America about
the connection of Protestant Christianity with the King.In his seventh
_Crisis_(November 21, 1778) he wrote sentences inspired by his new
conception of religion."In a Christian and philosophical sense, mankind seem to have stood
still at individual civilization, and to retain as nations all the
original rudeness of nature.... As individuals we profess ourselves
Christians, but as nations we are heathens, Romans, and what not.I
remember the late Admiral Saunders declaring in the House of Commons,
and that in the time of peace, 'That the city of Madrid laid in ashes
was not a sufficient atonement for the Spaniards taking off the rudder
of an English sloop of war.'...The arm of Britain has been spoken of as
the arm of the Almighty, and she has lived of late as if she thought
the whole world created for her diversion.Her politics, instead
of civilizing, has tended to brutalize mankind, and under the vain
unmeaning title of 'Defender of the Faith,' she has made war like an
Indian on the Religion of Humanity."'Thus, forty years before Auguste Comte sat, a youth of twenty, at the
feet of Saint Simon, learning the principles now known as "The Religion
of Humanity,"* Thomas Paine had not only minted the name, but with it
the idea of international civilization, in which nations are to treat
each other as gentlemen in private life.National honor was, he said,
confused with "bullying"; but "that which is the best character for an
individual is the best character for a nation."The great and pregnant
idea was, as in the previous instances, occasional.It was a sentence
passed upon the "Defender-of-the-Faith" superstition, which detached
faith from humanity, and had pressed the Indian's tomahawk into the
hands of Jesus.Thaddeus B. Wakeman, an eminent representative of the
     "Religion of Humanity," writes me that he has not found this
     phrase in any work earlier than Paine's _Crisis_, vii.At the close of the American Revolution there appeared little need for
a religious reformation.The people were happy, prosperous, and, there
being no favoritism toward any sect under the new state constitutions,
but perfect equality and freedom, the Religion of Humanity meant
sheathing of controversial swords also.It summoned every man to lend a
hand in repairing the damages of war, and building the new nationality.Paine therefore set about constructing his iron bridge of thirteen
symbolic ribs, to overleap the ice-floods and quicksands of rivers.His
assistant in this work, at Bordentown, New Jersey, John Hall, gives us
in his journal, glimpses of the religious ignorance and fanaticism of
that region.But Paine showed no aggressive spirit towards them."My
employer," writes Hall (1786), "has _Common Sense_ enough to disbelieve
most of the common systematic theories of Divinity, but does not seem
to establish any for himself."In all of his intercourse with Hall (a
Unitarian just from England), and his neighbors, there is no trace
of any disposition to deprive any one of a belief, or to excite any
controversy.Humanity did not demand it, and by that direction he left
the people to their weekly toils and Sunday sermons.But when (1787) he was in England, Humanity gave another command.It was
obeyed in the eloquent pages on religious liberty and equality in "The
Rights of Man."Burke had alarmed the nation by pointing out that the
Revolution in France had laid its hand on religion.The cry was raised
that religion was in danger.Paine then uttered his impressive paradox:

"Toleration is not the opposite of intoleration, but the counterfeit
of it.The one assumes the right of withholding
liberty of conscience, and the other of granting it.The one is the pope
armed with fire and <DW19>, the other is the pope selling or granting
indulgences.... Toleration by the same assumed authority by which it
tolerates a man to pay his worship, presumptuously and blasphemously
sets itself up to tolerate the Almighty to receive it.... Who then art
thou, vain dust and ashes, by whatever name thou art called, whether a
king, a bishop, a church or a state, a parliament or anything else, that
obtrudest thine insignificance between the soul of man and his maker?If he believes not as thou believest, it is a
proof that thou believest not as he believeth, and there is no earthly
power can determine between you.... Religion, without regard to names,
as directing itself from the universal family of mankind to the divine
object of all adoration, is man bringing to his maker the fruits of his
heart; and though these fruits may differ like the fruits of the earth,
the grateful tribute of every one is accepted."This, which I condense with reluctance, was the affirmation which the
Religion of Humanity needed in England.But when he came to sit in the
French Convention a new burden rolled upon him.There was Marat with the
Bible always before him, picking out texts that justified his murders;
there were Robespierre and Couthon invoking the God of Nature to
sanction just such massacres as Marat found in his Bible; and there were
crude "atheists" consecrating the ferocities of nature more dangerously
than if they had named them Siva, Typhon, or Satan.Paine had published
the rights of man for men; but here human hearts and minds had been
buried under the superstitions of ages.The great mischief had ensued,
to use his own words, "by the possession of power before they understood
principles: they earned liberty in words but not in fact" Exhumed
suddenly, as if from some Nineveh, resuscitated into semi-conscious
strength, they remembered only the methods of the allied inquisitors and
tyrants they were overthrowing; they knew no justice but vengeance; and
when on crumbled idols they raised forms called "Nature" and "Reason,"
old idols gained life in the new forms.These were the gods which had
but too literally created, by the slow evolutionary force of human
sacrifices, the new revolutionary priesthood.Their massacres could not
be questioned by those who acknowledged the divine hand in the slaughter
of Canaanites.*

     * On August 10, 1793, there was a sort of communion of the
     Convention around the statue of Nature, whose breasts were
     fountains of water.Herault de Sechelles, at that time
     president, addressed the statue: "Sovereign of the savage
     and of the enlightened nations, O Nature, this great people,
     gathered at the first beam of day before thee, is free!It
     is in thy bosom, it is in thy sacred sources, that it has
     recovered its rights, that it has regenerated itself after
     traversing so many ages of error and servitude: it must
     return to the simplicity of thy ways to rediscover liberty
     and equality.receive the expression of the
     eternal attachment of the French people for thy laws; and
     may the teeming waters gushing from thy breasts, may this
     pure beverage which refreshed the first human beings,
     consecrate in this Cup of Fraternity and Equality the vows
     that France makes thee this day,--the most beautiful that
     the sun has illumined since it was suspended in the
     immensity of space."The cup passed around from lip to lip,
     amid fervent ejaculations.Next year Nature's breasts
     issued Herault's blood.The Religion of Humanity again issued its command to its minister.The
"Age of Reason" was written, in its first form, and printed in French."Couthon," says Lanthenas, "to whom I sent it, seemed offended with me
for having translated it"* Couthon raged against the priesthood, but
could not tolerate a work which showed vengeance to be atheism, and
compassion--not merely for men, but for animals--true worship of God.*  The letter of Lanthenas to Merlin de Thionville, of which
     the original French is before me, is quoted in an article in
     Scribner, September, 1880, by Hon.E. B. Washbarne (former
     Minister to France); it is reprinted in Remsburg's
     compilation of testimonies: "Thomas Paine, the Apostle of
     Religions and Political Liberty" (1880).135
     of this volume.On the other hand, Paine's opposition to atheism would appear to have
brought him into danger from another quarter, in which religion could
not be distinguished from priestcraft.In a letter to Samuel Adams Paine
says that he endangered his life by opposing the king's execution, and
"a second time by opposing atheism."Those who denounce the "Age of
Reason" may thus learn that red-handed Couthon, who hewed men to pieces
before his Lord, and those who acknowledged no Lord, agreed with
them.Under these menaces the original work was as I have inferred,
suppressed.But the demand of Humanity was peremptory, and Paine
re-wrote it all, and more.When it appeared he was a prisoner; his
life was in Couthon's hands.He had personally nothing to gain by its
publication--neither wife, child, nor relative to reap benefit by its
sale.It was published as purely for the good of mankind as any work
ever written.Nothing could be more simply true than his declaration,
near the close of life:

"As in my political works my motive and object have been to give man an
elevated sense of his own character, and free him from the slavish and
superstitious absurdity of monarchy and hereditary government, so, in my
publications on religious subjects, my endeavors have been directed
to bring man to a right use of the reason that God has given him; to
impress on him the great principles of divine morality, justice, and
mercy, and a benevolent disposition to all men, and to all creatures;
and to inspire in him a spirit of trust, confidence and consolation, in
his Creator, unshackled by the fables of books pretending to be the word
of God."It is misleading at the present day to speak of Paine as an opponent
of Christianity.This would be true were Christianity judged by the
authorized formulas of any church; but nothing now acknowledged as
Christianity by enlightened Christians of any denomination was known
to him.In our time, when the humanizing wave, passing through all
churches, drowns old controversies, floats the dogmas, till it seems
ungenerous to quote creeds and confessions in the presence of our
"orthodox" lovers of man--even "totally depraved" and divinely doomed
man--the theological eighteenth century is inconceivable.Could one
wander from any of our churches, unless of the Christian Pagans or
remote villagers (_pagani_), into those of the last century, he would
find himself moving in a wilderness of cinders, with only the plaintive
song of John and Charles Wesley to break the solitude.If he would hear
recognition of the human Jesus, on whose credit the crowned Christ is
now maintained, he would be sharply told that it were a sin to "know
Christ after the flesh," and must seek such recognition among those
stoned as infidels.Three noble and pathetic tributes to the Man of
Nazareth are audible from the last century--those of Rousseau, Voltaire,
and Paine.From its theologians and its pulpits not one!Should the
tribute of Paine be to-day submitted, without his name, to our most
eminent divines, even to leading American and English Bishops, beside
any theological estimate of Christ from the same century, the Jesus of
Paine would be surely preferred.Should our cultured Christian of to-day press beyond those sectarian,
miserable controversies of the eighteenth century, known to him now as
cold ashes, into the seventeenth century, he would find himself in a
comparatively embowered land; that is, in England, and in a few oases
in America--like that of Roger Williams in Rhode Island.In England he
would find brain and heart still in harmony, as in Tillotson and South;
still more in Bishop Jeremy Taylor, "Shakespeare of divines."He would
hear this Jeremy reject the notions of original sin and transmitted
guilt, maintain the "liberty of prophesying," and that none should
suffer for conclusions concerning a book so difficult of interpretation
as the Bible.In those unsophisticated years Jesus and the disciples
and the Marys still wore about them the reality gained in miracle-plays.What Paine need arise where poets wrote the creed, and men knew the
Jesus of whom Thomas Dekker wrote:

                    "The best of men
     That e'er wore earth about him was a sufferer;
     A soft, meek, patient, humble, tranquil spirit,
     The first true gentleman that ever breathed."Dean Swift, whose youth was nourished in that living age, passed into
the era of dismal disputes, where he found the churches "dormitories of
the living as well as of the dead."Some ten years before Paine's birth
the Dean wrote: "Since the union of Divinity and Humanity is the great
Article of our Religion, 't is odd to see some clergymen, in their
writings of Divinity, wholly devoid of Humanity."Men have, he said,
enough religion to hate, but not to love.Had the Dean lived to the
middle of the eighteenth century he might have discovered exceptions
to this holy heartlessness, chiefly among those he had traditionally
feared--the Socinians.These, like the Magdalene, were seeking the lost
humanity of Jesus.He would have sympathized with Wesley, who escaped
from "dormitories of the living" far enough to publish the Life of a
Socinian (Firmin), with the brave apology, "I am sick of opinions, give
me the life."But Socianism, in eagerness to disown its bolder children,
presently lost the heart of Jesus, and when Paine was recovering it the
best of them could not comprehend his separation of the man from the
myth.So came on the desiccated Christianity of which Emerson said,
even among the Unitarians of fifty years ago, "The prayers and even the
dogmas of our church are like the zodiac of Denderah, wholly insulated
from anything now extant in the life and business of the people."Emerson may have been reading Paine's idea that Christ and the Twelve
were mythically connected with Sun and Zodiac, this speculation being
an indication of their distance from the Jesus he tenderly revered.If
Paine rent the temple-veils of his time, and revealed the stony images
behind them, albeit with rudeness, let it not be supposed that those
forms were akin to the Jesus and the Marys whom skeptical criticism is
re-incarnating, so that they dwell with us.Outside Paine's heart the
Christ of his time was not more like the Jesus of our time than Jupiter
was like the Prometheus he bound on a rock.The English Christ was not
the Son of Man, but a Prince of Dogma, bearing handcuffs for all who
reasoned about him; a potent phantasm that tore honest thinkers
from their families and cast them into outer darkness, because they
circulated the works of Paine, which reminded the clergy that the Jesus
even of their own Bible sentenced those only who ministered not to the
hungry and naked, the sick and in prison.There the brain had retreated to deistic caves, the heart had
gone off to "Salvationism" of the time; the churches were given over
to the formalist and the politician, who carried divine sanction to the
repetition of biblical oppressions and massacres by Burke and Pitt.And
in all the world there had not been one to cry _Sursum Corda_ against
the consecrated tyranny until that throb of Paine's heart which
brought on it the vulture.But to-day, were we not swayed by names and
prejudices, it would bring on that prophet of the divine humanity, even
the Christian dove.Soon after the appearance of Part First of the "Age of Reason" it
was expurgated of its negative criticisms, probably by some English
Unitarians, and published as a sermon, with text from Job xi., 7: "Canst
thou by searching find out God?Canst thou find out the Almighty to
perfection?"It was printed anonymously; and were its sixteen pages
read in any orthodox church to-day it would be regarded as admirable.It might be criticised by left wings as somewhat old-fashioned in the
warmth of its theism.It is fortunate that Paine's name was not appended
to this doubtful use of his work, for it would have been a serious
misrepresentation.*

     * "A Lecture on the Existence and Attributes of the Deity,
     as Deduced from a Contemplation of His Works.The copy in my possession is inscribed with pen: "This was
     J. Joyce's copy, and noticed by him as Paine's work."It is probable that the
     suppression of Paine's name was in deference to his
     outlawry, and to the dread, by a sect whose legal position
     was precarious, of any suspicion of connection with
     "Painite" principles.That his Religion of Humanity took the deistical form was an
evolutionary necessity.English deism was not a religion, but at first a
philosophy, and afterwards a scientific generalization.Its founder, as
a philosophy, Herbert of Cherbury, had created the matrix in which
was formed the Quaker religion of the "inner light," by which Paine's
childhood was nurtured; its founder as a scientific theory of creation,
Sir Isaac Newton, had determined the matrix in which all unorthodox
systems should originate.The real issue was between a sanctified
ancient science and a modern science.The utilitarian English race,
always the stronghold of science, had established the freedom of the
new deism, which thus became the mould into which all unorthodoxies ran.From the time of Newton, English and American thought and belief have
steadily become Unitarian.The dualism of Jesus, the thousand years
of faith which gave every soul its post in a great war between God
and Satan, without which there would have been no church, has steadily
receded before a monotheism which, under whatever verbal disguises,
makes the deity author of all evil.English Deism prevailed only to be
reconquered into alliance with a tribal god of antiquity, developed
into the tutelar deity of Christendom.And this evolution involved the
transformation of Jesus into Jehovah, deity of a "chosen" or "elect"
people.It was impossible for an apostle of the international republic,
of the human brotherhood, whose Father was degraded by any notion of
favoritism to a race, or to a "first-born son," to accept a name in
which foreign religions had been harried, and Christendom established on
a throne of thinkers' skulls.The philosophical and scientific deism of
Herbert and Newton had grown cold in Paine's time, but it was detached
from all the internecine figure-heads called gods; it appealed to the
reason of all mankind; and in that manger, amid the beasts, royal and
revolutionary, was cradled anew the divine humanity.Paine wrote "Deism" on his banner in a militant rather than an
affirmative way.He was aiming to rescue the divine Idea from
traditional degradations in order that he might with it confront a
revolutionary Atheism defying the celestial monarchy.In a later work,
speaking of a theological book, "An Antidote to Deism," he remarks: "An
antidote to Deism must be Atheism."So far as it is theological, the
"Age of Reason" was meant to combat Infidelity.It raised before the
French the pure deity of Herbert, of Newton, and other English deists
whose works were unknown in France.But when we scrutinize Paine's
positive Theism we find a distinctive nucleus forming within the
nebulous mass of deistical speculations.Paine recognizes a deity only
in the astronomic laws and intelligible order of the universe, and in
the corresponding reason and moral nature of man.Like Kant, he was
filled with awe by the starry heavens and man's sense of right*.The
first part of the "Age of Reason" is chiefly astronomical; with those
celestial wonders he contrasts such stories as that of Samson and the
foxes."When we contemplate the immensity of that Being who directs and
governs the incomprehensible Whole, of which the utmost ken of human
sight can discover but a part, we ought to feel shame at calling such
paltry stories the word of God."Then turning to the Atheist he says:
"We did not make ourselves; we did not make the principles of science,
which we discover and apply but cannot alter."The only revelation of
God in which he believes is "the universal display of himself in the
works of creation, and that repugnance we feel in ourselves to bad
actions, and disposition to do good ones.""The only idea we can have
of serving God, is that of contributing to the happiness of the living
creation that God has made."* Astronomy, as we know, he had studied profoundly.In early
     life he had studied astronomic globes, purchased at the cost
     of many a dinner, and the orrery(sp), and attended lectures
     at the Royal Society.In the "Age of Reason" he writes,
     twenty-one years before Herschel's famous paper on the
     Nebulae: "The probability is that each of those fixed stars
     is also a sun, round which another system of worlds or
     planets, though too remote for as to discover, performs its
     revolutions."It thus appears that in Paine's Theism the deity is made manifest, not
by omnipotence, a word I do not remember in his theories, but in this
correspondence of universal order and bounty with rcason and conscience,
and the humane heart In later works this speculative side of his Theism
presented a remarkable Zoroastrian variation.When pressed with Bishop
Butler's terrible argument against previous Deism,--that the God of
the Bible is no more cruel than the God of Nature,--Paine declared his
preference for the Persian religion, which exonerated the deity from
responsibility for natural evils, above the Hebrew which attributed
such things to God.He was willing to sacrifice God's omnipotence to
his humanity.He repudiates every notion of a devil, but was evidently
unwilling to ascribe the unconquered realms of chaos to the divine Being
in whom he believed.Thus, while theology was lowering Jesus to a mere King, glorying in
baubles of crown and throne, pleased with adulation, and developing
him into an authorizor of all the ills and agonies of the world, so
depriving him of his humanity, Paine was recovering from the universe
something like the religion of Jesus himself."Why even of yourselves
judge ye not what is right" In affirming the Religion of Humanity, Paine
did not mean what Comte meant, a personification of the continuous life
of our race*; nor did he merely mean benevolence towards all living
creatures.* Paine's friend and fellow-prisoner, Anacharsis Clootz, was
     the first to describe Humanity as "L'Etre Supreme."He affirmed a Religion based on the authentic divinity of that which
is supreme in human nature and distinctive of it The sense of right,
justice, love, mercy, is God himself in man; this spirit judges all
things,--all alleged revelations, all gods.In affirming a deity too
good, loving, just, to do what is ascribed to Jahve, Paine was animated
by the same spirit that led the early believer to turn from heartless
elemental gods to one born of woman, bearing in his breast a human
heart.Pauline theology took away this human divinity, and effected a
restoration, by making the Son of Man Jehovah, and commanding the heart
back from its seat of judgment, where Jesus had set it."Shall the clay
say to the potter, why hast thou formed me thus?""Yes," answered
Paine, "if the thing felt itself hurt, and could speak."He knew as did
Emerson, whom he often anticipates, that "no god dare wrong a worm."The force of the "Age of Reason" is not in its theology, though this
ethical variation of Deism in the direction of humanity is of exceeding
interest to students who would trace the evolution of avatars and
incarnations.Paine's theology was but gradually developed, and in this
work is visible only as a tide beginning to rise under the fiery orb of
his religious passion."If the
belief of errors not morally bad did no mischief, it would make no part
of the moral duty of man to oppose and remove them."He evinces regret
that the New Testament, containing so many elevated moral precepts,
should, by leaning on supposed prophecies in the Old Testament, have
been burdened with its barbarities."It must follow the fate of its
foundation."This fatal connection, he knows, is not the work of Jesus;
he ascribes it to the church which evoked from the Old Testament a
crushing system of priestly and imperial power reversing the benign
principles of Jesus.It is this oppression, the throne of all
oppressions, that he assails.His affirmations of the human deity are
thus mainly expressed in his vehement denials.This long chapter must now draw to a close.It would need a volume to
follow thoroughly the argument of this epoch-making book, to which
I have here written only an introduction, calling attention to its
evolutionary factors, historical and spiritual.Such then was the new
Pilgrim's Progress.As in that earlier prison, at Bedford, there shone
in Paine's cell in the Luxembourg a great and imperishable vision, which
multitudes are still following.The Christian teacher of to-day may well ponder this fact.The atheists
and secularists of our time are printing, reading, revering a work that
opposes their opinions.For above its arguments and criticisms they see
the faithful heart contending with a mighty Apollyon, girt with all the
forces of revolutionary and Royal Terrorism.Just this one Englishman,
born again in America, confronting George III.and Robespierre on earth
and tearing the like of them from the throne of the universe!Were it
only for the grandeur of this spectacle in the past Paine would maintain
his hold on thoughtful minds.But in America the hold is deeper than that.In this self-forgetting
insurrection of the human heart against deified Inhumanity there is an
expression of the inarticulate wrath of humanity against continuance of
the same wrong.In the circulation throughout the earth of the Bible as
the Word of God, even after its thousand serious errors of translation
are turned, by exposure, into falsehoods; in the deliverance to savages
of a scriptural sanction of their tomahawks and poisoned arrows; in the
diffusion among cruel tribes of a religion based on human sacrifice,
after intelligence has abandoned it; in the preservation of costly
services to a deity who "needs nothing at men's hands," beside hovels
of the poor who need much; in an exemption of sectarian property from
taxation which taxes every man to support the sects, and continues the
alliance of church and state; in these things, and others--the list is
long--there is still visible, however refined, the sting and claw of the
Apollyon against whom Paine hurled his far-reaching dart.The "Age of
Reason" was at first published in America by a religious house, and as
a religious book.It was circulated in Virginia by Washington's old
friend, Parson Weems.It is still circulated, though by supposed
unbelievers, as a religious book, and such it is.Its religion is expressed largely in those same denunciations which
theologians resent.I have explained them; polite agnostics apologize
for them, or cast Paine over as a Jonah of the rationalistic ship.But
to make one expression more gentle would mar the work.As it stands,
with all its violences and faults, it represents, as no elaborate or
polite treatise could, the agony and bloody sweat of a heart breaking in
the presence of crucified Humanity.What dear heads, what noble hearts
had that man seen laid low; what shrieks had he heard in the desolate
homes of the Condorcets, the Brissots; what Canaanite and Midianite
massacres had he seen before the altar of Brotherhood, erected by
himself!And all because every human being had been taught from his
cradle that there is something more sacred than humanity, and to which
man should be sacrificed.Of all those mas-sacred thinkers not one voice
remains: they have gone silent: over their reeking guillotine sits
the gloating Apollyon of Inhumanity.But here is one man, a prisoner,
preparing for his long silence.He alone can speak for those slain
between the throne and the altar.In these outbursts of laughter and
tears, these outcries that think not of literary style, these appeals
from surrounding chaos to the starry realm of order, from the tribune of
vengeance to the sun shining for all, this passionate horror of cruelty
in the powerful which will brave a heartless heaven or hell with its
immortal indignation,--in all these the unfettered mind may hear the
wail of enthralled Europe, sinking back choked with its blood, under the
chain it tried to break.So long as a link remains of the same chain,
binding reason or heart, Paine's "Age of Reason" will live.It is not a
mere book--it is a man's heart.FRIENDSHIPS

Baron Pichon, who had been a sinuous Secretary of Legation in America
under Genet and Fauchet, and attached to the Foreign Office in France
under the Directory, told George Ticknor, in 1837, that "Tom Paine, who
lived in Monroe's house at Paris, had a great deal too much influence
over Monroe."*

     *  "Life of George Ticknor," ii., p.223

The Baron, apart from his prejudice against republicanism (Talleyrand
was his master), knew more about American than French politics at the
time of Monroe's mission in France.The agitation caused in France
by Jay's negotiations in England, and rumors set afloat by their
secrecy,--such secrecy being itself felt as a violation of good
faith--rendered Monroe's position unhappy and difficult.After Paine's
release from prison, his generous devotion to France, undiminished
by his wrongs, added to the painful illness that reproached the
Convention's negligence, excited a chivalrous enthusiasm for him.Monroe for him, the fact that this faithful
friend of France was in their house, were circumstances of international
importance.Of Paine's fidelity to republican principles, and his
indignation at their probable betrayal in England, there could be no
doubt in any mind.He was consulted by the French Executive, and was
virtually the most important _attache_ of the United States Legation.The "intrigue" of which Thibaudeau had spoken, in Convention, as having
driven Paine from that body, was not given to the public, but it was
well understood to involve the American President.If Paine's suffering
represented in London Washington's deference to England, all the more
did he stand to France as a representative of those who in America
were battling for the Alliance.He was therefore a tower of strength
to Monroe.It will be seen by the subjoined letter that while he was
Monroe's guest it was to him rather than the Minister that the Foreign
Office applied for an introduction of a new Consul to Samuel Adams,
Governor of Massachusetts--a Consul with whom Paine was not personally
acquainted.The general feeling and situation in France at the date of
this letter (March 6th), and the anger at Jay's secret negotiations in
England, are reflected in it:

"My Dear Friend,--Mr.Mozard, who is appointed Consul, will present you
this letter.He is spoken of here as a good sort of man, and I can have
no doubt that you will find him the same at Boston.When I came from
America it was my intention to return the next year, and I have intended
the same every year since.The case I believe is, that as I am embarked
in the revolution, I do not like to leave it till it is finished,
notwithstanding the dangers I have run.I am now almost the only
survivor of those who began this revolution, and I know not how it is
that I have escaped.I know however that I owe nothing to the government
of America.The executive department has never directed either the
former or the present Minister to enquire whether I was dead or alive,
in prison or in liberty, what the cause of the imprisonment was, and
whether there was any service or assistance it could render.Monroe
acted voluntarily in the case, and reclaimed me as an American citizen;
for the pretence for my imprisonment was that I was a foreigner, born in
England."The internal scene here from the 31 of May 1793 to the fall of
Robespierre has been terrible.I was shut up in the prison of the
Luxembourg eleven months, and I find by the papers of Robespierre
that have been published by the Convention since his death, that I
was designed for a worse fate.The following memorandum is in his own
handwriting; 'Demander que Thomas Paine soit decrete d'accusation pour
les interets de l'Amerique autant que de la France.'"You will see by the public papers that the successes of the French arms
have been and continue to be astonishing, more especially since the fall
of Robespierre, and the suppression of the system of Terror.They
have fairly beaten all the armies of Austria, Prussia, England, Spain,
Sardignia, and Holland.Holland is entirely conquered, and there is now
a revolution in that country."I know not how matters are going on your side the water, but I think
everything is not as it ought to be.The appointment of G. Morris to
be Minister here was the most unfortunate and the most injudicious
appointment that could be made.Jefferson at
the time, and I said the same to Morris.Had he not been removed at
the time he was I think the two countries would have been involved in a
quarrel, for it is a fact, that he would either have been ordered away
or put in arrestation; for he gave every reason to suspect that he was
secretly a British Emissary.Jay is about in England I know not; but is it possible that
any man who has contributed to the Independence of America, and to free
her from the tyranny of the British Government, can read without shame
and indignation the note of Jay to Grenville?That the _United States
has no other resource than in the justice and magnanimity of his
Majesty_, is a satire upon the Declaration of Independence, and exhibits
[such] a spirit of meanness on the part of America, that, were it true,
I should be ashamed of her.Such a declaration may suit the spaniel
character of Aristocracy, but it cannot agree with manly character of a
Republican.Mozard is this moment come for this letter, and he sets off
directly.--God bless you, remember me among the circle of our friends,
and tell them how much I wish to be once more among them."*

     * Mr.Spofford, Librarian of Congress, has kindly copied
     this letter for me from the original, among the papers of
     George Bancroft.There are indications of physical feebleness as well as haste in this
letter.The spring and summer brought some vigor, but, as we have seen
by Monroe's letter to Judge Jones, he sank again and in the autumn
seemed nearing his end.Once more the announcement of his death appeared
in England, this time bringing joy to the orthodox.From the same
quarter, probably, whence issued, in 1793, "Intercepted Correspondence
from Satan to Citizen Paine," came now ( 1795 ) a folio sheet: "Glorious
News for Old England.The British Lyon rous'd; or John Bull for ever."The Fox has lost his Tail
     The Ass has done his Braying,
     The Devil has got Tom Paine."Good-hearted as Paine was, it must be admitted that he was cruelly
persistent in disappointing these British obituaries.Despite anguish,
fever, and abscess--this for more than a year eating into his side,--he
did not gratify those prayerful expectations by becoming a monument of
divine retribution.Nay, amid all these sufferings he had managed to
finish Part Second of the "Age of Reason," write the "Dissertation on
Government," and give the Address before the Convention, Nevertheless
when, in November, he was near death's door, there came from England
tidings grievous enough to crush a less powerful constitution.It was
reported that many of his staunchest old friends had turned against
him on account of his heretical book.This report seemed to find
confirmation in the successive volumes of Gilbert Wakefield in reply to
the two Parts of Paine's book.Wakefield held Unitarian opinions, and
did not defend the real fortress besieged by Paine.He was enraged that
Paine should deal with the authority of the Bible, and the orthodox
dogmas, as if they were Christianity, ignoring unorthodox versions
altogether.This, however, hardly explains the extreme and coarse
vituperation of these replies, which shocked Wakefield's friends.*

     * "The office of 'castigation' was unworthy of our friend's
     talents, and detrimental to his purpose of persuading
     others.Such a contemptuous treatment, even of an unfair
     disputant, was also too well calculated to depredate in the
     public estimation that benevolence of character by which Mr.--"Life of Gilbert
     Wakefield," 1804, ii., p.Although in his thirty-eighth year at this time, Wakefield was not old
enough to escape the _sequelae_ of his former clericalism.He had been a
Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, afterwards had a congregation, and
had continued his connection with the English Church after he was
led, by textual criticism, to adopt Unitarian opinions.He had
great reputation as a linguist, and wrote Scriptural expositions and
retranslations.But few read his books, and he became a tutor in a
dissenting college at Hackney, mainly under influence of the Unitarian
leaders, Price and Priestley.Wakefield would not condescend to any
connection with a dissenting society, and his career at Hackney was
marked by arrogant airs towards Unitarians, on account of a university
training, then not open to dissenters.He attacked Price and Priestley,
his superiors in every respect, apart from their venerable position
and services, in a contemptuous way; and, in fact, might be brevetted a
prig, with a fondness for coarse phrases, sometimes printed with blanks.He flew at Paine as if he had been waiting for him; his replies, not
affecting any vital issue, were displays of linguistic and textual
learning, set forth on the background of Paine's page, which he
blackened.He exhausts his large vocabulary of vilification on a book
whose substantial affirmations he concedes; and it is done in the mean
way of appropriating the credit of Paine's arguments.Gilbert Wakefield was indebted to the excitement raised by Paine for
the first notice taken by the general public of anything he ever
wrote.Paine, however, seems to have been acquainted with a sort of
autobiography which he had published in 1792.In this book Wakefield
admitted with shame that he had subscribed the Church formulas when he
did not believe them, while indulging in flings at Price, Priestley, and
others, who had suffered for their principles.At the same time there
were some things in Wakefield's autobiography which could not fail to
attract Paine: it severely attacked slavery, and also the whole course
of Pitt towards France.It
was consequently a shock when Gilbert Wakefield's outrageous abuse
of himself came to the invalid in his sick-room.It appeared to be an
indication of the extent to which he was abandoned by the Englishmen
who had sympathized with his political principles, and to a large extent
with his religious views.This acrimonious repudiation added groans to
Paine's sick and sinking heart, some of which were returned upon his
Socinian assailant, and in kind.This private letter my reader must
see, though it was meant for no eye but that of Gilbert Wakefield.It is
dated at Paris, November 19, 1795."Dear Sir,--When you prudently chose, like a starved apothecary,
to offer your eighteenpenny antidote to those who had taken my
two-and-sixpenny Bible-purge,* you forgot that although my dose
was rather of the roughest, it might not be the less wholesome for
possessing that drastick quality; and if I am to judge of its salutary
effects on your infuriate polemic stomach, by the nasty things it has
made you bring away, I think you should be the last man alive to take
your own panacea.As to the collection of words of which you boast the
possession, nobody, I believe, will dispute their amount, but every one
who reads your answer to my 'Age of Reason' will wish there were not so
many scurrilous ones among them; for though they may be very usefull
in emptying your gallbladder they are too apt to move the bile of other
people.* These were the actual prices of the books."Those of Greek and Latin are rather foolishly thrown away, I think, on
a man like me, who, you are pleased to say, is 'the greatest ignoramus
in nature': yet I must take the liberty to tell you, that wisdom does
not consist in the mere knowledge of language, but of things."You recommend me to _know myself_--a thing very easy to advise, but
very difficult to practice, as I learn from your own book; for you take
yourself to be a meek disciple of Christ, and yet give way to passion
and pride in every page of its composition."You have raised an ant-hill about the roots of my sturdy oak, and it
may amuse idlers to see your work; but neither its body nor its branches
are injured by you; and I hope the shade of my Civic Crown may be able
to preserve your little contrivance, at least for the season."When you have done as much service to the world by your writings, and
suffered as much for them, as I have done, you will be better entitled
to dictate: but although I know you to be a keener politician than Paul,
I can assure you, from my experience of mankind, that you do not much
commend the Christian doctrines to them by announcing that it requires
the labour of a learned life to make them understood."May I be permitted, after all, to suggest that your truly vigorous
talents would be best employed in teaching men to preserve their
liberties exclusively,--leaving to that God who made their immortal
souls the care of their eternal welfare."I am, dear Sir,

"Your true well-wisher,

"Tho.After a first perusal of this letter has made its unpleasant impression,
the reader will do well to read it again.Paine has repaired to his
earliest Norfolk for language appropriate to the coarser tongue of his
Nottinghamshire assailant; but it should be said that the offensive
paragraph, the first, is a travesty of one written by Wakefield.In his
autobiography, after groaning over his books that found no buyers,
a veritable "starved apothecary," Wakefield describes the uneasiness
caused by his pamphlet on "Religious Worship" as proof that the disease
was yielding to his "potion."He says that "as a physician of spiritual
maladies" he had seconded "the favourable operation of the first
prescription,"--and so forth.Paine, in using the simile, certainly
allows the drugs and phials of his sick-room to enter it to a
disagreeable extent, but we must bear in mind that we are looking over
his shoulder.We must also, by the same consideration of its privacy,
mitigate the letter's egotism.Wakefield's ant-hill protected by
the foliage, the "civic crown," of Paine's oak which it has
attacked,--gaining notice by the importance of the work it
belittles,--were admirable if written by another; and the egotism is
not without some warrant.It is the rebuke of a scarred veteran of the
liberal army to the insults of a subaltern near twenty years his junior.It was no doubt taken to heart For when the agitation which Gilbert
Wakefield had contributed to swell, and to lower, presently culminated
in handcuffs for the circulators of Paine's works, he was filled with
anguish.He vainly tried to resist the oppression, and to call back the
Unitarians, who for twenty-five years continued to draw attention from
their own heresies by hounding on the prosecution of Paine's adherents.*

     * "But I would not forcibly suppress this book ["Age of
     Reason"]; much less would I punish (O my God, be such
     wickedness far from me, or leave me destitute of thy favour
     in the midst of this perjured and sanguinary generation!)much less would I punish, by fine or imprisonment, from any
     possible consideration, the publisher or author of these
     pages."--Letter of Gilbert Wakefield to Sir John Scott,
     Attorney General, 1798.For evidence of Unitarian
     intolerance see the discourse of W, J. Fox on "The Duties of
     Christians towards Deists" (Collected Works, vol.In
     this discourse, October 24, 1819, on the prosecution of
     Carlile for publishing the "Age of Reason," Mr.Fox
     expresses his regret that the first prosecution should have
     been conducted by a Unitarian."Goaded," he says, "by the
     calumny which would identify them with those who yet reject
     the Saviour, they have, in repelling so unjust an
     accusation, caught too much of the tone of their opponents,
     and given the most undesirable proof of their affinity to
     other Christians by that unfairness towards the disbeliever
     which does not become any Christian."Fox
     became the champion of all the principles of "The Age of
     Reason" and "The Rights of Man."The prig perished; in his place stood a martyr of the freedom bound up
with the work he had assailed.Paine's other assailant, the Bishop of
Llandaff, having bent before Pitt, and episcopally censured the humane
side he once espoused, Gilbert Wakefield answered him with a boldness
that brought on him two years' imprisonment When he came out of prison
(1801) he was received with enthusiasm by all of Paine's friends, who
had forgotten the wrong so bravely atoned for.Had he not died in the
same year, at the age of forty-five, Gilbert Wakefield might have become
a standard-bearer of the freethinkers.Paine's recovery after such prolonged and perilous suffering was a
sort of resurrection.In April (1796) he leaves Monroe's house for the
country, and with the returning life of nature his strength is steadily
recovered.What to the man whose years of anguish, imprisonment,
disease, at last pass away, must have been the paths and hedgerows of
Versailles, where he now meets the springtide, and the more healing
sunshine of affection!Risen from his thorny bed of pain--

     "The meanest floweret of the vale,
     The simplest note that swells the gale,
     The common sun, the air, the skies,
     To him are opening paradise."So had it been even if nature alone had surrounded him.But Paine had
been restored by the tenderness and devotion of friends.Had it not been
for friendship he could hardly have been saved.We are little able, in
the present day, to appreciate the reverence and affection with which
Thomas Paine was regarded by those who saw in him the greatest apostle
of liberty in the world.Elihu Palmer spoke a very general belief when
he declared Paine "probably the most useful man that ever existed upon
the face of the earth."This may sound wild enough on the ears of those
to whom Liberty has become a familiar drudge.There was a time when she
was an ideal Rachel, to win whom many years of terrible service were
not too much; but now in the garish day she is our prosaic Leah,--a
serviceable creature in her way, but quite unromantic.In Paris there
were ladies and gentlemen who had known something of the cost of
Liberty,--Colonel and Mrs.Monroe, Sir Robert and Lady Smith, Madame
Lafayette, Mr.Barlow, M. and Madame De Bonneville.They
had known what it was to watch through anxious nights with terrors
surrounding them.He who had suffered most was to them a sacred person.He had come out of the succession of ordeals, so weak in body, so
wounded by American ingratitude, so sore at heart, that no delicate
child needed more tender care.Set those ladies and their charge a
thousand years back in the poetic past, and they become Morgan le Fay,
and the Lady Nimue, who bear the wounded warrior away to their Avalon,
there to be healed of his grievous hurts.Men say their Arthur is dead,
but their love is stronger than death.And though the service of
these friends might at first have been reverential, it had ended with
attachment, so great was Paine's power, so wonderful and pathetic his
memories, so charming the play of his wit, so full his response to
kindness.One especially great happiness awaited him when he became convalescent.Sir Robert Smith, a wealthy banker in Paris, made his acquaintance, and
he discovered that Lady Smith was no other than "The Little Corner of
the World," whose letters had carried sunbeams into his prison.* An
intimate friendship was at once established with Sir Robert and his
lady, in whose house, probably at Versailles, Paine was a guest after
leaving the Monroes.To Lady Smith, on discovering her, Paine addressed
a poem,--"The Castle in the Air to the Little Corner of the World":

     * Sir Robert Smith (Smythe in the Peerage List) was born in
     1744, and married, first, Miss Blake of London (1776).The
     name of the second Lady Smith, Paine's friend, before her
     marriage I have not ascertained."In the region of clouds, where the whirlwinds arise,
     My Castle of Fancy was built;
     The turrets reflected the blue from the skies,
     And the windows with sunbeams were gilt."The rainbow sometimes, in its beautiful state,
     Enamelled the mansion around;
     And the figures that fancy in clouds can create
     Supplied me with gardens and ground."I had grottos, and fountains, and orange-tree groves,
     I had all that enchantment has told;
     I had sweet shady walks for the gods and their loves,
     I had mountains of coral and gold."But a storm that I felt not had risen and rolled,
     While wrapped in a slumber I lay;
     And when I looked out in the morning, behold,
     My Castle was carried away."It passed over rivers and valleys and groves,
     The world it was all in my view;
     I thought of my friends, of their fates, of their loves,
     And often, full often, of you."At length it came over a beautiful scene,
     That nature in silence had made;
     The place was but small, but't was sweetly serene,
     And chequered with sunshine and shade."I gazed and I envied with painful good will,
     And grew tired of my seat in the air;
     When all of a sudden my Castle stood still,
     As if some attraction were there."Like a lark from the sky it came fluttering down,
     And placed me exactly in view,
     When whom should I meet in this charming retreat
     This corner of calmness, but--you."Delighted to find you in honour and ease,
     I felt no more sorrow nor pain;
     But the wind coming fair, I ascended the breeze,
     And went back with my Castle again."The kindness that rescued him from death was
followed by the friendship that beguiled him from horrors of the past.From gentle ladies he learned that beyond the Age of Reason lay the
forces that defeat Giant Despair."To reason [so he writes to Lady Smith] against feelings is as vain as
to reason against fire: it serves only to torture the torture, by adding
reproach to horror.All reasoning with ourselves in such cases acts upon
us like the reasoning of another person, which, however kindly done,
serves but to insult the misery we suffer.If Reason could remove the
pain, Reason would have prevented it.If she could not do the one, how
is she to perform the other?In all such cases we must look upon Reason
as dispossessed of her empire, by a revolt of the mind.She retires to a
distance to weep, and the ebony sceptre of Despair rules alone.All that
Reason can do is to suggest, to hint a thought, to signify a wish, to
cast now and then a kind of bewailing look, to hold up, when she
can catch the eye, the miniature shaded portrait of Hope; and though
dethroned, and can dictate no more, to wait upon us in the humble
station of a handmaid."The mouth of the rescued and restored captive was filled with song.Several little poems were circulated among his friends, but not printed;
among them the following:

"Contentment; or, if you please, Confession.Barlow, on
her pleasantly telling the author that, after writing against the
superstition of the Scripture religion, he was setting up a religion
capable of more bigotry and enthusiasm, and more dangerous to its
votaries--that of making a religion of Love._

     "O could we always live and love,
     And always be sincere,
     I would not wish for heaven above,
     My heaven would be here."Though many countries I have seen,
     And more may chance to see,
     My Little Corner of the World
     Is half the world to me."The other half, as you may guess,
     America contains;
     And thus, between them, I possess
     The whole world for my pains."I'm then contented with my lot,
     I can no happier be;
     For neither world I'm sure has got
     So rich a man as me."Then send no fiery chariot down
     To take me off from hence,
     But leave me on my heavenly ground--
     This prayer is _common sense_."Let others choose another plan,
     I mean no fault to find;
     The true theology of man
     Is happiness of mind."Paine gained great favor with the French government and fame throughout
Europe by his pamphlet, "The Decline and Fall of the English System of
Finance," in which he predicted the suspension of the Bank of England,
which followed the next year.He dated the pamphlet April 8th, and the
Minister of Foreign Affairs is shown, in the Archives of that office, to
have ordered, on April 27th, a thousand copies.It was translated in all
the languages of Europe, and was a terrible retribution for the forged
assignats whose distribution in France the English government had
considered a fair mode of warfare.This translation "into all the
languages of the continent" is mentioned by Ralph Broome, to whom the
British government entrusted the task of answering the pamphlet.* As
Broome's answer is dated June 4th, this circulation in six or seven
weeks is remarkable, The proceeds were devoted by Paine to the relief of
prisoners for debt in Newgate, London.**

     * "Observations on Mr.Broome
     escapes the charge of prejudice by speaking of "Mr.Paine,
     whose abilities I admire and deprecate in a breath."Paine's
     pamphlet was also replied to by George Chalmers ("Oldys")
     who had written the slanderous biography.** Richard Carlile's sketch of Paine, p.This large
     generosity to English sufferers appears the more
     characteristic beside the closing paragraph of Paine's
     pamphlet, "As an individual citizen of America, and as far
     as an individual can go, I have revenged (if I may use the
     expression without any immoral meaning) the piratical
     depredations committed on American commerce by the English
     government.I have retaliated for France on the subject of
     finance: and I conclude with retorting on Mr.Pitt the
     expression he used against France, and say, that the English
     system of finance 'is en the verge, nay even in the gulf of
     bankruptcy.'"Concerning the false French assignats forged in  England,
     see  Louis Blanc's "History of the Revolution," vol.xii.,
     p.The concentration of this pamphlet on its immediate subject, which made
it so effective, renders it of too little intrinsic interest in the
present day to delay us long, especially as it is included in all
editions of Paine's works.It possesses, however, much biographical
interest as proving the intellectual power of Paine while still but a
convalescent.He never wrote any work involving more study and mastery
of difficult details.It was this pamphlet, written in Paris, while
"Peter Porcupine," in America, was rewriting the slanders of "Oldys,"
which revolutionized Cobbett's opinion of Paine, and led him to try and
undo the injustice he had wrought.It now so turned out that Paine was able to repay all the kindnesses he
had received.The relations between the French government and Monroe,
already strained, as we have seen, became in the spring of 1796 almost
intolerable.The Jay treaty seemed to the French so incredible that,
even after it was ratified, they believed that the Representatives would
refuse the appropriation needed for its execution.But when tidings came
that this effort of the House of Representatives had been crushed by a
menaced _coup d'etat_, the ideal America fell in France, and was broken
in fragments.Monroe could now hardly have remained save on the credit
of Paine with the French.There was, of course, a fresh accession of
wrath towards England for this appropriation of the French alliance.Paine had been only the first sacrifice on the altar of the new
alliance; now all English families and all Americans in Paris except
himself were likely to become its victims.The English-speaking
residents there made one little colony, and Paine was sponsor for them
all.His fatal blow at English credit proved the formidable power of the
man whom Washington had delivered up to Robespierre in the interest of
Pitt.So Paine's popularity reached its climax; the American Legation
found through him a _modus vivendi_ with the French government; the
families which had received and nursed him in his weakness found in his
intimacy their best credential.Joel Barlow especially, while her
husband was in Algeria, on the service of the American government, might
have found her stay in Paris unpleasant but for Paine s friendship.The
importance of his guarantee to the banker, Sir Robert Smith, appears by
the following note, written at Versailles, August 13th:

"Citizen Minister: The citizen Robert Smith, a very particular friend
of mine, wishes to obtain a passport to go to Hamburg, and I will be
obliged to you to do him that favor.Himself and family have lived
several years in France, for he likes neither the government nor the
climate of England.He has large property in England, but his Banker
in that country has refused sending him remittances.This makes it
necessary for him to go to Hamburg, because from there he can draw his
money out of his Banker's hands, which he cannot do whilst in France.His family remains in France.--_Salut et fraternite._

"Thomas Paine."Amid his circle of cultured and kindly friends Paine had dreamed of a
lifting of the last cloud from his life, so long overcast.His eyes were
strained to greet that shining sail that should bring him a response to
his letter of September to Washington, in his heart being a great hope
that his apparent wrong would be explained as a miserable mistake,
and that old friendship restored.As the reader knows, the hope was
grievously disappointed.The famous public letter to Washington (August
3d), which was not published in France, has already been considered, in
advance of its chronological place.It will be found, however, of more
significance if read in connection with the unhappy situation, in which
all of Paine's friends, and all Americans in Paris, had been brought
by the Jay treaty.From their point of view the deliverance of Paine to
prison and the guillotine was only one incident in a long-planned and
systematic treason, aimed at the life of the French republic.Jefferson
in America, and Paine in France, represented the faith and hope of
republicans that the treason would be overtaken by retribution and
reversal.* Soon after Jefferson became President Paine wrote to him,
     suggesting that Sir Robert's firm might be safely depended
     on as the medium of American financial transactions in
     Europe.THEOPHILANTHROPY

In the ever-recurring controversies concerning Paine and his "Age
of Reason" we have heard many triumphal claims.Christianity and
the Church, it is said, have advanced and expanded, unharmed by such
criticisms.But there are several fallacies implied in
this mode of dealing with the religious movement caused by Paine's work.It assumes that Paine was an enemy of all that now passes under the name
of Christianity--a title claimed by nearly a hundred and fifty different
organizations, with some of which (as the Unitarians, Universalists,
Broad Church, and Hick-site Friends) he would largely sympathize.It
further assumes that he was hostile to all churches, and desired or
anticipated their destruction.Paine desired and
anticipated their reformation, which has steadily progressed.At the
close of the "Age of Reason" he exhorts the clergy to "preach something
that is edifying, and from texts that are known to be true.""The Bible of the creation is inexhaustible in texts.Every part of
science, whether connected with the geometry of the universe, with
the systems of animal and vegetable life, or with the properties of
inanimate matter, is a text for devotion as well as for philosophy--for
gratitude as for human improvement.It will perhaps be said, that, if
such a revolution in the system of religion takes place, every preacher
ought to be a philosopher.And every house of devotion
a school of science.It has been by wandering, from the immutable laws
of science, and the right use of reason, and setting up an invented
thing called revealed religion, that so many wild and blasphemous
conceits nave been formed of the Almighty.The Jews have made him the
assassin of the human species, to make room for the religion of the
Jews.The Christians have made him the murderer of himself, and the
founder of a new religion, to supersede and expel the Jewish religion.And to find pretence and admission for these things they must have
supposed his power and his wisdom imperfect, or his will changeable; and
the changeableness of the will is the imperfection of the judgment.The
philosopher knows that the laws of the Creator have never changed
with respect either to the principles of science, or the properties of
matter.Why then is it to be supposed they have changed with respect to
man?"To the statement that Christianity has not been impeded by the "Age of
Reason," it should be added that its advance has been largely due to
modifications rendered necessary by that work.The unmodified dogmas
are represented in small and eccentric communities.The advance has
been under the Christian name, with which Paine had no concern; but
to confuse the word "Christianity" with the substance it labels is
inadmissible.George and the Dragon; but
English culture has reduced the saint and dragon to a fable.The special wrath with which Paine is still visited, above all other
deists put together, or even atheists is a tradition from a so-called
Christianity which his work compelled to capitulate.That system is
now nearly extinct, and the vendetta it bequeathed should now end.The
capitulation began immediately with the publication of the Bishop of
Llandaff's "Apology for the Bible," a title that did not fail to attract
notice when it appeared (1796).There were more than thirty replies to
Paine, but they are mainly taken out of the Bishop's "Apology," to which
they add nothing.It is said in religious encyclopedias that Paine was
"answered" by one and another writer, but in a strict sense Paine was
never answered, unless by the successive surrenders referred to.As Bishop Watson's "Apology" is adopted by most authorities as the
sufficient "answer," it may be here accepted as a representative of the
rest.Whether Paine's points dealt with by the Bishop are answerable
or not, the following facts will prove how uncritical is the prevalent
opinion that they were really answered.Watson concedes generally to Paine the discovery of some "real
difficulties" in the Old Testament, and the exposure, in the Christian
grove, of "a few unsightly shrubs, which good men had wisely concealed
from public view" (p.* It is not Paine that here calls some
"sacred" things unsightly, and charges the clergy with concealing
them--it is the Bishop.Among the particular and direct concessions made
by the Bishop are the following:

     * Corey's edition.That Moses may not have written every part of the Pentateuch.Some
passages were probably written by later hands, transcribers or editors
(pp.[If human reason and scholarship are admitted to detach
any portions, by what authority can they be denied the right to bring
all parts of the Pentateuch, or even the whole Bible, under their human
judgment?]The law in Deuteronomy giving parents the right, under certain
circumstances, to have their children stoned to death, is excused only
as a "humane restriction of a power improper to be lodged with any
parent" (p.[Granting the Bishop's untrue assertion, that the same
"improper" power was arbitrary among the Romans, Gauls, and Persians,
why should it not have been abolished in Israel?Watson
possessed the right to call any law established in the Bible "improper,"
how can Paine be denounced for subjecting other things in the book
to moral condemnation?The moral sentiment is not an episcopal
prerogative.]The Bishop agrees that it is "the opinion of many learned men and
good Christians" that the Bible, though authoritative in religion, is
fallible in other respects, "relating the ordinary history of the times"
(p.[What but human reason, in the absence of papal authority, is
to draw the line between the historical and religious elements in the
Bible?]It is conceded that "Samuel did not write any part of the second book
bearing his name, and only a part of the first" (p.[One of many
blows dealt by this prelate at confidence in the Bible.]It is admitted that Ezra contains a contradiction in the estimate
of the numbers who returned from Babylon; it is attributed to a
transcriber's mistake of one Hebrew figure for another (p.[Paine's
question here had been: "What certainty then can there be in the Bible
for anything"?It is no answer to tell him how an error involving a
difference of 12,542 people may perhaps have occurred.]It is admitted that David did not write some of the Psalms ascribed
to him (p."It is acknowledged that the order of time is not everywhere
observed" [in Jeremiah]; also that this prophet, fearing for his life,
suppressed the truth [as directed by King Zedekiah]."He was under
no obligation to tell the whole [truth] to men who were certainly his
enemies and no good subjects of the king" (pp.[But how can it
be determined how much in Jeremiah is the "word of God," and how much
uttered for the casual advantage of himself or his king?]It is admitted that there was no actual fulfilment of Ezekie's
prophecy, "No foot of man shall pass through it [Egypt], nor foot of
beast shall pass through it, for forty years" (p.The discrepancies between the genealogies of Christ, in Matthew and
Luke, are admitted: they are explained by saying that Matthew gives the
genealogy of Joseph, and Luke that of Mary; and that Matthew commits "an
error" in omitting three generations between Joram and Ozias (p.[Paine had asked, why might not writers mistaken in the natural
genealogy of Christ be mistaken also in his celestial genealogy?Such are some of the Bishop's direct admissions.There are other admissions in his silences and evasions.For instance,
having elaborated a theory as to how the error in Ezra might occur, by
the close resemblance of Hebrew letters representing widely different
numbers, he does not notice Nehemiah's error in the same matter, pointed
out by Paine,--a self-contradiction, and also a discrepancy with Ezra,
which could not be explained by his theory.He says nothing about
several other contradictions alluded to by Paine.The Bishop's evasions
are sometimes painful, as when he tries to escape the force of Paine's
argument, that Paul himself was not convinced by the evidences of the
resurrection which he adduces for others.The Bishop says: "That Paul
had so far resisted the evidence which the apostles had given of the
resurrection and ascension of Jesus, as to be a persecutor of the
disciples of Christ, is certain; but I do not remember the place where
he declares that he had not believed them."But when Paul says, "I
verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to
the name of Jesus of Nazareth," surely this is inconsistent with his
belief in the resurrection and ascension.Paul declares that when it
was the good pleasure of God "to reveal his Son in me," immediately he
entered on his mission.He "was not disobedient to the heavenly vision."Clearly then Paul had not been convinced of the resurrection and
ascension until he saw Christ in a vision.In dealing with Paine's moral charges against the Bible the Bishop has
left a confirmation of all that I have said concerning the Christianity
of his time.An "infidel" of to-day could need no better moral arguments
against the Bible than those framed by the Bishop in its defence.He
justifies the massacre of the Canaanites on the ground that they were
sacrificers of their own children to idols, cannibals, addicted to
unnatural lust Were this true it would be no justification; but as no
particle of evidence is adduced in support of these utterly unwarranted
and entirely fictitious accusations, the argument now leaves the
massacre without any excuse at all.The extermination is not in the
Bible based on any such considerations, but simply on a divine command
to seize the land and slay its inhabitants.No legal right to the land
is suggested in the record; and, as for morality, the only persons
spared in Joshua's expedition were a harlot and her household, she
having betrayed her country to the invaders, to be afterwards exalted
into an ancestress of Christ.Of the cities destroyed by Joshua it is
said: "It was of Jehovah to harden their hearts, to come against Israel
in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have
no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Jehovah commanded Moses"
(Joshua xi., 20).As their hearts were thus in Jehovah's power for
hardening, it may be inferred that they were equally in his power for
reformation, had they been guilty of the things alleged by the Bishop.With these things before him, and the selection of Rahab for mercy
above all the women in Jericho--every woman slain save the harlot who
delivered them up to slaughter--the Bishop says: "The destruction of the
Canaanites exhibits to all nations, in all ages, a signal proof of God's
displeasure against sin."The Bishop rages against Paine for supposing that the commanded
preservation of the Midianite maidens, when all males and married women
were slain, was for their "debauchery.""Prove this, and I will allow that Moses was the horrid monster you make
him--prove this, and I will allow that the Bible is what you call it--'a
book of lies, wickedness, and blasphemy'--prove this, or excuse my
warmth if I say to you, as Paul said to Elymas the sorcerer, who sought
to turn away Sergius Paulus from the faith, 'O full of all subtilty,
and of all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all
righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the
Lord?'--I did not, when I began these letters, think that I should
have been moved to this severity of rebuke, by anything you could
have written; but when so gross a misrepresentation is made of God's
proceedings, coolness would be a crime."And what does my reader suppose is the alternative claimed by the
prelate's foaming mouth?The maidens, he declares, were not reserved for
debauchery, but for slavery!Little did the Bishop foresee a time when, of the two suppositions,
Paine's might be deemed the more lenient.The subject of slavery was
then under discussion in England, and the Bishop is constrained to add,
concerning this enslavement of thirty-two thousand maidens, from
the massacred families, that slavery is "a custom abhorrent from our
manners, but everywhere practised in former times, and still practised
in countries where the benignity of the Christian religion has not
softened the ferocity of human nature."Thus, Jehovah is represented
as not only ordering the wholesale murder of the worshippers of another
deity, but an adoption of their "abhorrent" and inhuman customs.This connection of the deity of the Bible with "the ferocity of human
nature" in one place, and its softening in another, justified Paine's
solemn rebuke to the clergy of his time."Had the cruel and murderous orders with which the Bible is filled,
and the numberless torturing executions of men, women, and children, in
consequence of those orders, been ascribed to some friend whose memory
you revered, you would have glowed with satisfaction at detecting the
falsehood of the charge, and gloried in defending his injured fame.It is because ye are sunk in the cruelty of superstition, or feel no
interest in the honor of your Creator, that ye listen to the horrid
tales of the Bible, or hear them with callous indifference."This is fundamentally what the Bishop has to answer, and of course he
must resort to the terrible _Tu quoque_ of Bishop Butler, Dr.Watson
says he is astonished that "so acute a reasoner" should reproduce the
argument."You profess yourself to be a deist, and to believe that there is a God,
who created the universe, and established the laws of nature, by which
it is sustained in existence.You profess that from a contemplation
of the works of God you derive a knowledge of his attributes; and you
reject the Bible because it ascribes to God things inconsistent (as you
suppose) with the attributes which you have discovered to belong to
him; in particular, you think it repugnant to his moral justice that
he should doom to destruction the crying and smiling infants of the
Canaanites.Why do you not maintain it to be repugnant to his moral
justice that he should suffer crying or smiling infants to be swallowed
up by an earthquake, drowned by an inundation, consumed by fire, starved
by a famine, or destroyed by a pestilence?"Watson did not, of course, know that he was following Bishop Butler
in laying the foundations of atheism, though such was the case.As was
said in my chapter on the "Age of Reason," this dilemma did not really
apply to Paine, His deity was inferred, despite all the disorders in
nature, exclusively from its apprehensible order without, and from the
reason and moral nature of man.He had not dealt with the problem of
evil, except implicitly, in his defence of the divine goodness, which is
inconsistent with the responsibility of his deity for natural evils, or
for anything that would be condemned by reason and conscience if done by
man.It was thus the Christian prelate who had abandoned the primitive
faith in the divine humanity for a natural deism, while the man he calls
a "child of the devil" was defending the divine humanity.This then was the way in which Paine was "answered," for I am not aware
of any important addition to the Bishop's "Apology" by other opponents.I cannot see how any Christian of the present time can regard it
otherwise than as a capitulation of the system it was supposed to
defend, however secure he may regard the Christianity of to-day.It
subjects the Bible to the judgment of human reason for the determination
of its authorship, the integrity of its text, and the correction of
admitted errors in authorship, chronology, and genealogy; it admits the
fallibility of the writers in matters of fact; it admits that some of
the moral laws of the Old Testament are "improper" and others, like
slavery, belonging to "the ferocity of human nature"; it admits the
non-fulfilment of one prophet's prediction, and the self-interested
suppression of truth by another; and it admits that "good men" were
engaged in concealing these "unsightly" things.Here are gates thrown
open for the whole "Age of Reason."The unorthodoxy of the Bishop's "Apology" does not rest on the judgment
of the present writer alone.If Gilbert Wakefield presently had to
reflect on his denunciations of Paine from the inside of a prison, the
Bishop of Llandaff had occasion to appreciate Paine's ideas on "mental
lying" as the Christian infidelity.The Bishop, born in the same year
(1737) with the two heretics he attacked--Gibbon and Paine--began his
career as a professor of chemistry at Cambridge (1764), but seven years
later became Regius professor of divinity there.His posthumous papers
present a remarkable picture of the church in his time.In replying to
Gibbon he studied first principles, and assumed a brave stand against
all intellectual and religious coercion.On the episcopal bench he
advocated a liberal policy toward France.In undertaking to answer Paine
he became himself unsettled; and at the very moment when unsophisticated
orthodoxy was hailing him as its champion, the sagacious magnates of
Church and State proscribed him.He learned that the king had described
him as "impracticable"; with bitterness of soul he saw prelates of
inferior rank and ability promoted over his head.He tried the effect
of a political recantation, in one of his charges; and when Williams was
imprisoned for publishing the "Age of Reason," and Gilbert Wakefield
for rebuking his "Charge," this former champion of free speech dared not
utter a protest.He seems to
have at length made up his mind that if he was to be punished for his
liberalism he would enjoy it.While preaching on "Revealed Religion" he
saw the Bishop of London shaking his head.In 18111, five years before
his death, he writes this significant note: "I have treated my divinity
as I, twenty-five years ago, treated my chemical papers: I have lighted
my fire with the labour of a great portion of my life."*

     * Patrick Henry's Answer to the "Age of Reason" shared the
     like fate."When, during the first two years of his
     retirement, Thomas Paine's 'Age of Reason' made its
     appearance, the old statesman was moved to write out a
     somewhat elaborate treatise in defence of the truth of
     Christianity.This treatise it was his purpose to have
     published.'He read the manuscript to his family as he
     progressed with it, and completed it a short time before his
     death' (1799).When it was finished, however, 'being
     diffident about his own work,' and impressed also by the
     great ability of the replies to Paine which were then
     appearing in England, 'he directed his wife to destroy' what
     he had written.She 'complied literally with his
     directions,' and thus put beyond the chance of publication a
     work which seemed, to some who heard it, 'the most eloquent
     and unanswerable argument in defence of the Bible which was
     ever written.'"quoted in Tyler's "Patrick
     Henry."Next to the "Age of Reason," the book that did most to advance Paine's
principles in England was, as I believe, Dr.Watson's "Apology for the
Bible."Dean Swift had warned the clergy that if they began to reason
with objectors to the creeds they would awaken skepticism.He pointed out, as Gilbert Wakefield did,
some exegetical and verbal errors in Paine's book, but they no more
affected its main purpose and argument than the grammatical mistakes in
"Common Sense" diminished its force in the American Revolution.David
Dale, the great manufacturer at Paisley, distributed three thousand
copies of the "Apology" among his workmen.The books carried among them
extracts from Paine, and the Bishop's admissions.Robert Owen married
Dale's daughter, and presently found the Paisley workmen a ripe harvest
for his rationalism and radicalism.Thus, in the person of its first clerical assailant, began the march
of the "Age of Reason" in England.In the Bishop's humiliations for
his concessions to truth, were illustrated what Paine had said of his
system's falsity and fraudulence.After the Bishop had observed the
Bishop of London manifesting disapproval of his sermon on "Revealed
Religion" he went home and wrote: "What is this thing called Orthodoxy,
which mars the fortunes of honest men?It is a sacred thing to which
every denomination of Christians lays exclusive claim, but to which no
man, no assembly of men, since the apostolic age, can prove a title."There is now a Bishop of London who might not acknowledge the claim
even for the apostolic age.The principles, apart from the particular
criticisms, of Paine's book have established themselves in the
English Church.They were affirmed by Bishop Wilson in clear language:
"Christian duties are founded on reason, not on the sovereignty of God
commanding what he pleases: God cannot command us what is not fit to be
believed or done, all his commands being founded in the necessities of
our nature."It was on this principle that Paine declared that things
in the Bible, "not fit to be believed or done," could not be divine
commands.His book, like its author, was outlawed, but men more heretical are
now buried in Westminster Abbey, and the lost bones of Thomas Paine are
really reposing in those tombs.It was he who compelled the hard and
heartless Bibliolatry of his time to repair to illiterate conventicles,
and the lovers of humanity, true followers of the man of Nazareth, to
abandon the crumbling castle of dogma, preserving its creeds as archaic
bric-a-brac.As his "Rights of Man" is now the political constitution
of England, his "Age of Reason" is in the growing constitution of its
Church,--the most powerful organization in Christendom because the
freest and most inclusive.The excitement caused in England by the "Age of Reason," and the large
number of attempted replies to it, were duly remarked by the _Moniteur_
and other French journals.The book awakened much attention in France,
and its principles were reproduced in a little French book entitled:
"Manuel des Theoantropophiles."In
January, 1797, Paine, with five families, founded in Paris the church
of Theo-philanthropy,--a word, as he stated in a letter to Erskine
"compounded of three Greek words, signifying God, Love, and Man.The
explanation given to this word is _Lovers of God and Man, or Adorers of
God and Friends of Man._" The society opened "in the street Denis, No."The Theophilanthropists believe in
the existence of God, and the immortality of the soul."The inaugural
discourse was given by Paine.It opens with these words: "Religion
has two principal enemies, Fanaticism and Infidelity, or that which
is called atheism.The first requires to be combated by reason and
morality, the other by natural philosophy."The discourse is chiefly an
argument for a divine existence based on motion, which, he maintains,
is not a property of matter.It proves a Being "at the summit of all
things."At the close he says:

"The society is at present in its infancy, and its means are small; but
I wish to hold in view the subject I allude to, and instead of teaching
the philosophical branches of learning as ornamental branches only, as
they have hitherto been taught, to teach them in a manner that shall
combine theological knowledge with scientific instruction.To do this to
the best advantage, some instruments will be necessary for the purpose
of explanation, of which the society is not yet possessed.But as the
views of the Society extend to public good, as well as to that of the
individual, and as its principles can have no enemies, means may be
devised to procure them.If we unite to the present instruction a series
of lectures on the ground I have mentioned, we shall, in the first
place, render theology the most entertaining of all studies.In the
next place, we shall give scientific instruction to those who could
not otherwise obtain it.The mechanic of every profession will there be
taught the mathematical principles necessary to render him proficient
in his art.The cultivator will there see developed the principles of
vegetation; while, at the same time, they will be led to see the hand of
God in all these things."A volume of 214 pages put forth at the close of the year shows that the
Theophilanthropists sang theistic and humanitarian hymns, and read Odes;
also that ethical readings were introduced from the Bible, and from
the Chinese, Hindu, and Greek authors.A library was established
(rue Neuve-Etienne-l'Estrapade, No.25) at which was issued (1797),
"Instruction Elementaire sur la Morale religieuse,"--this being declared
to be morality based on religion.{1797}

Thus Paine, pioneer in many things, helped to found the first theistic
and ethical society.It may now be recognized as a foundation of the Religion of Humanity.It
was a great point with Paine that belief in the divine existence was the
one doctrine common to all religions.On this rock the Church of Man was
to be built Having vainly endeavored to found the international Republic
he must repair to an ideal moral and human world.Robespierre and Pitt
being unfraternal he will bring into harmony the sages of all races.It is a notable instance of Paine's unwillingness to bring a personal
grievance into the sacred presence of Humanity that one of the four
festivals of Theophilanthropy was in honor of Washington, while its
catholicity was represented in a like honor to St.The
others so honored were Socrates and Rousseau.These selections were no
doubt mainly due to the French members, but they could hardly have been
made without Paine's agreement.It is creditable to them all that, at a
time when France believed itself wronged by Washington, his services to
liberty should alone have been remembered.The flowers of all races, as
represented in literature or in history, found emblematic association
with the divine life in nature through the flowers that were heaped on
a simple altar, as they now are in many churches and chapels.The walls
were decorated with ethical mottoes, enjoining domestic kindness and
public benevolence.Paine's pamphlet of this year (1797) on "Agrarian Justice" should be
considered part of the theophil-anthropic movement.It was written as a
proposal to the French government, at a time when readjustment of landed
property had been rendered necessary by the Revolution.*

     * "Thomas Payne a la Legislature et au Directoire: ou la
     Justice Agraire Opposee a la Loi et aux Privileges
     Agraires."It was suggested by a sermon printed by the Bishop of Llandaff, on "The
wisdom and goodness of God in having made both rich and poor."Paine
denies that God made rich and poor: "he made only male and female, and
gave them the earth for their inheritance."The earth, though naturally
the equal possession of all, has been necessarily appropriated by
individuals, because their improvements, which alone render its
productiveness adequate to human needs, cannot be detached from the
soil.Paine maintains that these private owners do nevertheless owe
mankind ground-rent.He therefore proposes a tithe,--not for God,
but for man.He advises that at the time when the owner will feel
it least,--when property is passing by inheritance from one to
another,--the tithe shall be taken from it.Personal property also owes
a debt to society, without which wealth could not exist,--as in the case
of one alone on an island.By a careful estimate he estimates that a
tithe on inheritances would give every person, on reaching majority,
fifteen pounds, and after the age of fifty an annuity of ten pounds,
leaving a substantial surplus for charity.The practical scheme
submitted is enforced by practical rather than theoretical
considerations.Property is always imperilled by poverty, especially
where wealth and splendor have lost their old fascinations, and awaken
emotions of disgust."To remove the danger it is necessary to remove the antipathies, and
this can only be done by making property productive of a national
blessing, extending to every individual When the riches of one man above
another shall increase the national fund in the same proportion; when it
shall be seen that the prosperity of that fund depends on the prosperity
of individuals; when the more riches a man acquires, the better it shall
be for the general mass; it is then that antipathies will cease, and
property be placed on the permanent basis of national interest and
protection."I have no property in France to become subject to the plan I propose.What I have, which is not much, is in the United States of America.But
I will pay one hundred pounds sterling towards this fund in France, the
instant it shall be established; and I will pay the same sum in England,
whenever a similar establishment shall take place in that country."The tithe was to be given to rich and poor alike, including owners of
the property tithed, in order that there should be no association of
alms with this "agrarian justice."About this time the priesthood began to raise their heads again.A
report favorable to a restoration to them of the churches, the raising
of bells, and some national recognition of public worship, was made by
Camille Jordan for a committee on the subject The Jesuitical report was
especially poetical about church bells, which Paine knew would ring the
knell of the Republic.He wrote a theophilanthropic letter to Camille
Jordan, from which I quote some paragraphs."You claim a privilege incompatible with the Constitution, and with
Rights.The Constitution protects equally, as it ought to do, every
profession of religion; it gives no exclusive privilege to any.The
churches are the common property of all the people; they are national
goods, and cannot be given exclusively to any one profession, because
the right does not exist of giving to any one that which appertains to
all.It would be consistent with right that the churches should be sold,
and the money arising therefrom be invested as a fund for the education
of children of poor parents of every profession, and, if more than
sufficient for this purpose, that the surplus be appropriated to the
support of the aged poor.After this every profession can erect its own
place of worship, if it choose--support its own priests, if it choose to
have any--or perform its worship without priests, as the Quakers do.""It is a want of feeling to talk of priests and bells whilst so many
infants are perishing in the hospitals, and aged and infirm poor in the
streets.The abundance that France possesses is sufficient for every
want, if rightly applied; but priests and bells, like articles of
luxury, ought to be the least articles of consideration.""No man ought to make a living by religion.Religion is not an act that can be performed by proxy.Every person must perform it for himself; and
all that a priest can do is to take from him; he wants nothing but his
money, and then to riot in the spoil and laugh at his credulity.The
only people who, as a professional sect of Christians, provide for the
poor of their society, are people known by the name of Quakers.They assemble quietly in their places of worship,
and do not disturb their neighbors with shows and noise of bells.Religion does not unite itself to show and noise."One good schoolmaster is of more use than a hundred priests.If we look
back at what was the condition of France under the _ancien regime_ we
cannot acquit the priests of corrupting the morals of the nation.""Why has the Revolution of France been stained with crimes, while the
Revolution of the United States of America was not?Men are physically
the same in all countries; it is education that makes them different.Accustom a people to believe that priests, or any other class of men,
can forgive sins, and you will have sins in abundance."While Thomas Paine was thus founding; in Paris a religion of love to God
expressed in love to man, his enemies in England were illustrating
by characteristic fruits the dogmas based on a human sacrifice.The
ascendency of the priesthood of one church over others, which he
was resisting in France, was exemplified across the channel in the
prosecution of his publisher, and the confiscation of a thousand pounds
which had somehow fallen due to Paine.* The "Age of Reason," amply
advertised by its opponents, had reached a vast circulation, and a
prosecution of its publisher, Thomas Williams, for blasphemy, was
instituted in the King's Bench.Williams being a poor man, the defence
was sustained by a subscription.**

     * This loss, mentioned by Paine in a private note, occurred
     about the time when he had devoted the proceeds of his
     pamphlet on English Finance, a very large sum, to prisoners
     held for debt in Newgate.I suppose the thousand pounds were
     the proceeds of the "Age of Reason."** Subscriptions (says his circular) will be received by J.
     Ashley, Shoemaker, No.6 High Holborn; C. Cooper, Grocer,
     New Compton St., Soho; G. Wilkinson, Printer, No.115
     Shoreditch; J. Rhynd, Printer, Ray St., Clerkenwell; R.
     Hodgson, Hatter, No.It will be
     observed that the defence of free printing had fallen to
     humble people.The extent to which the English reign
of terror had gone was shown in the fact that Erskine was now the
prosecutor; he who five years before had defended the "Rights of Man,"
who had left the court in a carriage drawn by the people, now stood
in the same room to assail the most sacred of rights.He began with a
menace to the defendant's counsel (S. Kyd) on account of a notice served
on the prosecution, foreshadowing a search into the Scriptures.*

     * "The King v. Thomas Williams for Blasphemy.--Take notice
     that the Prosecutors of the Indictment against the above
     named Defendant will upon the Trial of this cause be
     required to produce a certain Book described in the said
     Indictment to be the Holy Bible.--John Martin.Solicitor for
     the Defendant.Dated the 17th day of June 1797.""No man," he cried, "deserves to be upon the Rolls of the Court who
dares, as an Attorney, to put his name to such a notice.It is an insult
to the authority and dignity of the Court of which he is an officer;
since it seems to call in question the very foundations of its
jurisdiction."So soon did Erskine point the satire of the fable he
quoted from Lucian, in Paine's defence, of Jupiter answering arguments
with thunderbolts.Erskine's argument was that the King had taken a
solemn oath "to maintain the Christian Religion as it is promulgated by
God in the Holy Scriptures.""Every man has a right to investigate, with
modesty and decency, controversial points of the Christian religion; but
no man, consistently with a law which only exists under its sanction,
has a right not only broadly to deny its very existence, but to pour
forth a shocking and insulting invective, etc."The law, he said,
permits, by a like principle, the intercourse between the sexes to
be set forth in plays and novels, but punishes such as "address the
imagination in a manner to lead the passions into dangerous excesses."Erskine read several passages from the "Age of Reason," which, their
main point being omitted, seemed mere aimless abuse.In his speech, he
quoted as Paine's words of his own collocation, representing the author
as saying, "The Bible teaches nothing but 'lies, obscenity, cruelty,
and injustice.'"This is his entire and inaccurate rendering of
what Paine,--who always distinguishes the "Bible" from the "New
Testament,"--says at the close of his comment on the massacre of the
Midianites and appropriation of their maidens:

"People in general know not what wickedness there is in this pretended
word of God.Brought up in habits of superstition, they take it for
granted that the Bible [Old Testament] is true, and that it is good;
they permit themselves not to doubt it; and they carry the ideas they
form of the benevolence of the Almighty to the book they have been
taught to believe was written by his authority.it is a book of lies, wickedness, and blasphemy;
for what can be greater blasphemy than to ascribe the wickedness of man
to the orders of the Almighty?"Erskine argued that the sanction of Law was the oath by which judges,
juries, witnesses administered law and justice under a belief in
"the revelation of the unutterable blessings which shall attend their
observances, and the awful punishments which shall await upon their
transgressions."The rest of his opening argument was, mainly, that
great men had believed in Christianity.Kyd, in replying, quoted from the Bishop of Llandaff's "Answer to
Gibbon": "I look upon the right of private judgment, in every respect
concerning God and ourselves, as superior to the control of human
authority"; and his claim that the Church of England is distinguished
from Mahometanism and Romanism by its permission of every man to utter
his opinion freely.Waddington,
the Bishop of Chichester, who declared that Woolston "ought not to be
punished for being an infidel, nor for writing against the Christian
religion."He quoted Paine's profession of faith on the first page of
the incriminated book: "I believe in one God and no more; I hope for
happiness, beyond this life; I believe in the equality of men, and I
believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy,
and endeavouring to make our fellow creatures happy."He also quoted
Paine's homage to the character of Jesus.He defied the prosecution to
find in the "Age of Reason" a single passage "inconsistent with the
most chaste, the most correct system of morals," and declared the very
passages selected for indictment pleas against obscenity and cruelty.Kyd pointed out fourteen narratives in the Bible (such as Sarah
giving Hagar to Abraham, Lot and his daughters, etc.)which, if found in
any other book, would be pronounced obscene.He was about to enumerate
instances of cruelty when the judge, Lord Kenyon, indignantly
interrupted him, and with consent of the jury said he could only allow
him to cite such passages without reading them.Kyd gratefully
acknowledged this release from the "painful task" of reading such
horrors from the "Word of God"!)One of the interesting things about
this trial was the disclosure of the general reliance on Butler's
"Analogy," used by Bishop Watson in his reply to Paine,--namely, that
the cruelties objected to in the God of the Bible are equally found
in nature, through which deists look up to their God.When Kyd, after
quoting from Bishop Watson, said, "Gentlemen, observe the weakness of
this answer," Lord Kenyon exclaimed: "I cannot sit in this place and
hear this kind of discussion."Kyd said: "My Lord, I stand here on the
privilege of an advocate in an English Court of Justice: this man has
applied to me to defend him; I have undertaken his defence; and I have
often heard your Lordship declare, that every man had a right to be
defended.I know no other mode by which I can seriously defend him
against this charge, than that which I am now pursuing; if your Lordship
wish to prevent me from pursuing it, you may as well tell me to abandon
my duty to my client at once."Lord Kenyon said: "Go on, Sir."Returning
to the analogy of the divinely ordered massacres in the Bible with the
like in nature, Kyd said:

"Gentlemen, this is reasoning by comparison; and reasoning by comparison
is often fallacious.On the present occasion the fallacy is this: that,
in the first case, the persons perish by the operation of the general
laws of nature, not suffering punishment for a crime; whereas, in the
latter, the general laws of nature are suspended or transgressed, and
God commands the slaughter to avenge his offended will.Is this then
a satisfactory answer to the objection?I think it is not; another may
think so too; which it may be fairly supposed the Author did; and then
the objection, as to him, remains in full force, and he cannot, from
insisting upon it, be fairly accused of malevolent intention."In his answer Erskine said: "The history of man is the history of man's
vices and passions, which could not be censured without adverting to
their existence; many of the instances that have been referred to were
recorded as memorable warnings and examples for the instruction of
mankind."But for this argument Erskine was indebted to his old client,
Paine, who did not argue against the things being recorded, but against
the belief "that the inhuman and horrid butcheries of men, women, and
children, told of in those books, were done, as those books say they
were done, at the command of God."Paine says: "Those accounts are
nothing to us, nor to any other persons, unless it be to the Jews, as
a part of the history of their nation; and there is just as much of
the word of God in those books as there is in any of the histories of
France, or Rapin's 'History of England,' or the history of any other
country."As in Paines own trial in 1792, the infallible scheme of a special jury
was used against Williams.Lord Kenyon closed his charge with the words:
"Unless it was for the most malignant purposes, I cannot conceive how it
was published.It is, however, for you to judge of it, and to do justice
between the Public and the Defendant.""The jury instantly found the Defendant--Guilty."Paine at once wrote a letter to Erskine, which was first printed in
Paris.He calls attention to the injustice of the special jury system,
in which all the jurymen are nominated by the crown.In London a special
jury generally consists of merchants."Talk to some London merchants
about scripture, and they will understand you mean scrip, and tell you
how much it is worth at the Stock Exchange.Ask them about Theology,
and they will say they know no such gentleman upon 'Change."He also
declares that Lord Kenyon's course in preventing Mr.Kyd from reading
passages from the Bible was irregular, and contrary to words, which he
cites, used by the same judge in another case.This Letter to Erskine contains some effective passages.In one of these
he points out the sophistical character of the indictment in declaring
the "Age of Reason" a blasphemous work, tending to bring in contempt
the holy scriptures."The charge should have stated that the work was
intended to prove certain books not the holy scriptures.It is one
thing if I ridicule a work as being written by a certain person; but it
is quite a different thing if I write to prove that such a work was not
written by such person.In the first case I attack the person through
the work; in the other case I defend the honour of the person against
the work."After alluding to the two accounts in Genesis of the creation
of man, according to one of which there was no Garden of Eden and no
forbidden tree, Paine says:

"Perhaps I shall be told in the cant language of the day, as I have
often been told by the Bishop of Llandaff and others, of the great and
laudable pains that many pious and learned men have taken to explain the
obscure, and reconcile the contradictory, or, as they say, the seemingly
contradictory passages of the Bible.It is because the Bible needs such
an undertaking, that is one of the first causes to suspect it is _not_
the word of God: this single reflection, when carried home to the mind,
is in itself a volume.does not the Creator of the Universe, the
Fountain of all Wisdom, the Origin of all Science, the Author of all
Knowledge, the God of Order and of Harmony, know how to write?When
we contemplate the vast economy of the creation, when we behold the
unerring regularity of the visible solar system, the perfection with
which all its several parts revolve, and by corresponding assemblage
form a whole;--when we launch our eye into the boundless ocean of space,
and see ourselves surrounded by innumerable worlds, not one of which
varies from its appointed place--when we trace the power of a Creator,
from a mite to an elephant, from an atom to an universe, can we suppose
that the mind [which] could conceive such a design, and the power
that executed it with incomparable perfection, cannot write without
inconsistence; or that a book so written can be the work of such a
power?The writings of Thomas Paine, even of Thomas Paine, need no
commentator to explain, compound, arrange, and re-arrange their several
parts, to render them intelligible--he can relate a fact, or write an
essay, without forgetting in one page what he has written in another;
certainly then, did the God of all perfection condescend to write or
dictate a book, that book would be as perfect as himself is perfect: The
Bible is not so, and it is confessedly not so, by the attempts to mend
it."Paine admonishes Erskine that a prosecution to preserve God's word, were
it really God's word, would be like a prosecution to prevent the sun
from falling out of heaven; also that he should be able to comprehend
that the motives of those who declare the Bible not God's word
are religious.He then gives him an account of the new church of
Theophilanthropists in Paris, and appends his discourse before that
society.In the following year, Paine's discourse to the Theophilanthropists was
separately printed by Clio Rickman, with a sentence from Shakespeare
in the title-page: "I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the
morality of imprisonment" There was also the following dedication:

"The following little Discourse is dedicated to the enemies of Thomas
Paine, by one who has known him long and intimately, and who is
convinced that he is the enemy of no man.It is printed to do good, by
a well wisher to the world.By one who thinks that discussion should
be unlimited, that all coercion is error; and that human beings should
adopt no other conduct towards each other but an appeal to truth and
reason."Paine wrote privately, in the same sense as to Erskine, to his
remonstrating friends.In one such letter (May 12th) he goes again
partly over the ground."You," he says, "believe in the Bible from the
accident of birth, and the Turks believe in the Koran from the same
accident, and each calls the other _infidel_.This answer to your letter
is not written for the purpose of changing your opinion.It is written
to satisfy you, and some other friends whom I esteem, that my disbelief
of the Bible is founded on a pure and religious belief in God.""All
are infidels who believe falsely of God.""Belief in a cruel God makes a
cruel man."Paine had for some time been attaining unique fame in England.Some
publisher had found it worth while to issue a book, entitled "Tom
Paine's Jests: Being an entirely new and select Collection of Patriotic
Bon Mots, Repartees, Anecdotes, Epigrams, &c, on Political Subjects.There are hardly a half dozen items by Paine in the book
(72 pages), which shows that his name was considered marketable.The
government had made the author a cause.Erskine, who had lost his office
as Attorney-General for the Prince of Wales by becoming Paine's counsel
in 1792, was at once taken back into favor after prosecuting the "Age of
Reason," and put on his way to become Lord Erskine.The imprisonment of
Williams caused a reaction in the minds of those who had turned
against Paine.The terror
manifested at the name of Paine--some were arrested even for showing his
portrait--was felt to be political.None of the aristocratic deists, who
wrote for the upper classes, were dealt with in the same way.Paine had
proclaimed from the housetops what, as Dr.Watson confessed, scholars
were whispering in the ear.There were lampoons of Paine, such as
those of Peter Pindar (Rev.John Wolcott), but they only served to
whet popular curiosity concerning him.* The "Age of Reason" had passed
through several editions before it was outlawed, and every copy of it
passed through many hands.From the prosecution and imprisonment of
Williams may be dated the consolidation of the movement for the
"Rights of Man," with antagonism to the kind of Christianity which
that injustice illustrated.Political liberalism and heresy thenceforth
progressed in England, hand in hand.* "I have preserved," says Royall Tyler, "an epigram of
     Peter Pindar's, written originally in a blank leaf of a copy
     of Paine's 'Age of Reason,' and not inserted in any of his
     works."'Tommy Paine wrote this book to prove that the bible Was an old woman's
dream of fancies most idle; That Solomon's proverbs were made by low
livers, That prophets were fellows who sang semiquavers; That religion
and miracles all were a jest, And the devil in torment a tale of the
priest.Though Beelzebub's absence from hell I 'll maintain!Yet we all
must allow that the Devil's in Paine.'"THE REPUBLICAN ABDIEL

The sight of James Monroe and Thomas Paine in France, representing
Republican America, was more than Gouverneur Morris could stand.He sent
to Washington the abominable slander of Monroe already quoted (ii., p.173), and the Minister's recall came at the close of 1796.* Monroe
could not sail in midwinter with his family, so they remained until
the following spring.Paine made preparations to return to America
with them, and accompanied them to Havre; but he found so many "british
frigates cruising in sight" (so he writes Jefferson) that he did not
"trust [himself] to their discretion, and the more so as [he] had no
confidence in the Captain of the Dublin Packet" Sure enough this Captain
Clay was friendly enough with the British cruiser which lay in wait
to catch Paine, but only succeeded in finding his letter to Jefferson.Before returning from Havre to Paris he wrote another letter to
Vice-President Jefferson.* This sudden recall involved Monroe in heavy expenses,
     which Congress afterwards repaid.Frederick McGuire, of Washington, for the manuscript of
     Monroe's statement of his expenses and annoyances caused by
     his recall, which he declares due to "the representations
     which were made to him [Washington] by those in whom he
     confided."He states that Paine remained in his house a year
     and a half, and that be advanced him 250 louis d'or.For
     these services to Paine, he adds, "no claims were ever
     presented on my part, nor is any indemnity now desired."This money was repaid ($1,188) to Monroe by an Act of
     Congress, April 7, 1831.The advances are stated in the Act
     to have been made "from time to time," and were no doubt
     regarded by both Paine and Monroe as compensated by the many
     services rendered by the author to the Legation."Havre, May 14th, 1797."Dear Sir,--I wrote to you by the Ship Dublin Packet, Captain Clay,
mentioning my intention to have returned to America by that Vessel, and
to have suggested to some Member of the House of Representatives the
propriety of calling Mr.Monroe before them to have enquired into the
state of their affairs in France.This might have laid the foundation
for some resolves on their part that might have led to an accommodation
with France, for that House is the only part of the American Government
that have any reputation here.Monroe of my design, and
he wishes to be called up."You will have heard before this reaches you that the Emperor has been
obliged to sue for peace, and to consent to the establishment of the new
republic in Lombardy.How France will proceed with respect to England,
I am not, at this distance from Paris, in the way of knowing, but am
inclined to think she meditates a descent upon that Country, and a
revolution in its Government.If this should be the plan, it will keep
me in Europe at least another year."As the british party has thrown the American commerce into wretched
confusion, it is necessary to pay more attention to the appointment of
Consuls in the ports of france, than there was occasion to do in time
of peace; especially as there is now no Minister, and Mr.Skipwith,
who stood well with the Government here, has resigned.Cutting, the
Consul for Havre, does not reside at it, and the business is altogether
in the hands of De la Motte, the Vice Consul, who is a frenchman, [and]
cannot have the full authority proper for the office in the difficult
state matters are now in.I do not mention this to the disadvantage of
Mr.Cutting, for no man is more proper than himself if he thought it an
object to attend to."I know not if you are acquainted with Captain Johnson of
Massachusetts--he is a staunch man and one of the oldest American
Captains in the American employ.He is now settled at Havre and is a
more proper man for a Vice Consul than La Motte.He has written to some of his friends to have
the appointment and if you can see an opportunity of throwing in a
little service for him, you will do a good thing.He would be well received as an
individual, but as an Envoy of John Adams he could do nothing.The following, in Paine's handwriting, is copied from the original in
the Morrison papers, at the British Museum.It was written in the summer
of 1797, when Lord Malmsbury was at Lille in negotiation for peace.The negotiations were broken off because the English commissioners were
unauthorized to make the demanded restorations to Holland and Spain.Paine's essay was no doubt sent to the Directory in the interests of
peace, suggesting as it does a compromise, as regards the Cape of Good
Hope."Cape of Good Hope.--It is very well known that Dun-das, the English
Minister for Indian affairs, is tenacious of holding the Cape of Good
Hope, because it will give to the English East India Company a monopoly
of the commerce of India; and this, on the other hand, is the very
reason that such a claim is inadmissible by France, and by all the
nations trading in India and to Canton, and would also be injurious to
Canton itself.--We pretend not to know anything of the negociations at
Lille, but it is very easy to see, from the nature of the case, what
ought to be the condition of the Cape.It ought to be a free port open
to the vessels of all nations trading to any part of the East Indias.It
ought also to be a neutral port at all times, under the guarantee of
all nations; the expense of keeping the port in constant repair to
be defrayed by a tonnage tax to be paid by every vessel, whether
of commerce or of war, and in proportion to the time of their
stay.--Nothing then remains but with respect to the nation who shall be
the port-master; and this ought to be the Dutch, because they understand
the business best.As the Cape is a half-way stage between Europe and
India, it ought to be considered as a tavern, where travellers on a long
journey put up for rest and refreshment.--T.The suspension of peace negotiations,* and the bloodless defeat of
Pichigru's conspiracy of 18 Fructidor (September 4th) were followed by a
pamphlet addressed to "The People of France and the French Armies."This
little work is of historical value, in connection with 18 Fructidor, but
it was evidently written to carry two practical points.The first was,
that if the war with England must continue it should be directed to the
end of breaking the Anglo-Germanic compact.England has the right to
her internal arrangements, but this is an external matter.While "with
respect to England it has been the cause of her immense national debt,
the ruin of her finances, and the insolvency of her bank," English
intrigues on the continent "are generated by, and act through, the
medium of this Anglo-Germanic compound.Let the elector retire to his electorate, and the world will have
peace."Paine's other main point is, that the neutral nations should
secure, in time of war, an unarmed neutrality.* In a letter to Duane, many years later, Paine relates the
     following story concerning the British Union: "When Lord
     Malmsbury arrived in Paris, in the time of the Directory
     Government, to open a negociation for a peace, his
     credentials ran in the old style of 'George, by the grace of
     God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, king.'Malmsbury
     was informed that although the assumed title of king of
     France, in his credentials, would not prevent France opening
     a negociation, yet that no treaty of peace could be
     concluded until that assumed title was removed.Pitt then
     hit on the Union.Bill, under which the assumed title of
     king of France was discontinued.""Were the neutral nations to associate, under an honorable injunction of
fidelity to each other, and publickly declare to the world, that if any
belligerent power shall seize or molest any ship or vessel belonging
to the citizens or subjects of any of the powers composing that
association, that the whole association will shut its ports against the
flag of the offending nation, and will not permit any goods, wares,
or merchandize, produced or manufactured in the offending nation, or
appertaining thereto, to be imported into any of the ports included
in the association, until reparation be made to the injured party; the
reparation to be three times the value of the vessel and cargo; and
moreover that all remittances in money, goods, and bills of exchange, do
cease to be made to the offending nation, until the said reparation be
made.Were the neutral nations only to do this, which it is their
direct interest to do, England, as a nation depending on the commerce of
neutral nations in time of war, dare not molest them, and France would
not But whilst, from want of a common system, they individually permit
England to do it, because individually they cannot resist it, they put
France under the necessity of doing the same thing.The supreme of all
laws, in all cases, is that of self-preservation."It is a notable illustration of the wayward course of political
evolution, that the English republic--for it is such--grew largely out
of the very parts of its constitution once so oppressive.The foreign
origin of the royal family helped to form its wholesome timidity about
meddling with politics, allowing thus a development of ministerial
government.The hereditary character of the throne, which George
III.'s half-insane condition associated with the recklessness of
irresponsibility, was by his complete insanity made to serve ministerial
independence.Regency is timid about claiming power, and childhood
cannot exercise it.The decline of royal and aristocratic authority in
England secured freedom to commerce, which necessarily gave hostages to
peace.The protection of neutral commerce at sea, concerning which Paine
wrote so much, ultimately resulted from English naval strength, which
formerly scourged the world.To Paine, England, at the close of 1797, could appear only as a
dragon-guarded prison of fair Humanity.The press was paralyzed,
thinkers and publishers were in prison, some of the old orators like
Erskine were bought up, and the forlorn hope of liberty rested only with
Fox and his fifty in Parliament, overborne by a majority made brutal by
strength.The groans of imprisoned thought in his native land reached
its outlawed representative in Paris.And at the same time the inhuman
decree went forth from that country that there should be no peace with
France.It had long been his conviction that the readiness of Great
Britain to go to war was due to an insular position that kept the
horrors at a distance.This conviction,
which we have several times met in these pages, returned to him with new
force when England now insisted on more bloodshed.He was convinced that
the right course of France would be to make a descent on England, ship
the royal family to Hanover, open the political prisons, and secure the
people freedom to make a Constitution.These views, freely expressed
to his friends of the Directory and Legislature, reached the ears of
Napoleon on his triumphal return from Italy.The great man called upon Paine in his little room, and invited him
to dinner.He made the eloquent professions of republicanism so
characteristic of Napoleons until they became pretenders.He told Paine
that he slept with the "Rights of Man" under his pillow, and that its
author ought to have a statue of gold.*

     * Rickman, p.He consulted Paine about a descent on England, and adopted the plan.He
invited the author to accompany the expedition, which was to consist of
a thousand gun-boats, with a hundred men each.Paine consented, "as
[so he wrote Jefferson] the intention of the expedition was to give the
people of England an opportunity of forming a government for themselves,
and thereby bring about peace."One of the points to be aimed at was
Norfolk, and no doubt Paine indulged a happy vision of standing once
more in Thetford and proclaiming liberty throughout the land!The following letter (December 29, 1797) from Paine to Barras is in the
archives of the Directory, with a French translation:

"Citizen President,--A very particular friend of mine, who had a
passport to go to London upon some family affairs and to return in three
months, and whom I had commissioned upon some affairs of my own (for
I find that the English government has seized upon a thousand pounds
sterling which I had in the hands of a friend), returned two days ago
and gave me the memorandum which I enclose:--the first part relates only
to my publication on the event of the 18 Fructidor, and to a letter to
Erskine (who had been counsel for the prosecution against a former
work of mine the 'Age of Reason') both of which I desired my friend to
publish in London.The other part of the memorandum respects the state
of affairs in that country, by which I see they have little or no idea
of a descent being made upon them; tant mieux--but they will be guarded
in Ireland, as they expect a descent there."I expect a printed copy of the letter to Erskine in a day or two.As
this is in English, and on a subject that will be amusing to the Citizen
Revelliere Le Peaux, I will send it to him.The friend of whom I speak
was a pupil of Dessault the surgeon, and whom I once introduced to
you at a public audience in company with Captain Cooper on his plan
respecting the Island of Bermuda.--Salut et Respect."{1798}

Thus once again did the great hope of a liberated, peaceful, and
republican Europe shine before simple-hearted Paine.He was rather poor
now, but gathered up all the money he had, and sent it to the Council of
Five Hundred.The accompanying letter was read by Coupe at the sitting
of January 28, 1798:

"Citizens Representatives,--Though it is not convenient to me, in the
present situation of my affairs, to subscribe to the loan towards the
descent upon England, my economy permits me to make a small patriotic
donation.I send a hundred livres, and with it all the wishes of my
heart for the success of the descent, and a voluntary offer of any
service I can render to promote it."There will be no lasting peace for France, nor for the world, until
the tyranny and corruption of the English government be abolished, and
England, like Italy, become a sister republic.As to those men, whether
in England, Scotland, or Ireland, who, like Robespierre in France, are
covered with crimes, they, like him, have no other resource than in
committing more.But the mass of the people are the friends of liberty:
tyranny and taxation oppress them, but they deserve to be free."Accept, Citizens Representatives, the congratulations of an old
colleague in the dangers we have passed, and on the happy prospect
before us.Coupe added: "The gift which Thomas Paine offers you appears very
trifling, when it is compared with the revolting injustice which this
faithful friend of liberty has experienced from the English government;
but compare it with the state of poverty in which our former colleague
finds himself, and you will then think it considerable."He moved that
the notice of this gift and Thomas Paine's letter be printed."Mention
honorable et impression," adds the Moniteur.The President of the Directory at this time was Larevelliere-Lepeaux, a
friend of the Theophilanthropic Society.To him Paine gave, in English,
which the president understood, a plan for the descent, which was
translated into French, and adopted by the Directory.Two hundred and
fifty gun-boats were built, and the expedition abandoned.To Jefferson,
Paine intimates his suspicion that it was all "only a feint to cover the
expedition to Egypt, which was then preparing."He also states that the
British descent on Ostend, where some two thousand of them were made
prisoners, "was in search of the gun-boats, and to cut the <DW18>s, to
prevent their being assembled."This he was told by Vanhuile, of Bruges,
who heard it from the British officers.After the failure of his attempt to return to America with the Monroes,
Paine was for a time the guest of Nicolas de Bonneville, in Paris,
and the visit ended in an arrangement for his abode with that family.Bonneville was an editor, thirty-seven years of age, and had been one of
the five members of Paine's Republican Club, which placarded Paris with
its manifesto after the king's flight in 1791.An enthusiastic
devotee of Paine's principles from youth, he had advocated them in
his successive journals, _Le Tribun du Peuple, Bouche de Fer, and
Bien Informe_.He had resisted Marat and Robespierre, and suffered
imprisonment during the Terror.He spoke English fluently, and was
well known in the world of letters by some striking poems, also by his
translation into French of German tales, and parts of Shakespeare.He
had set up a printing office at No.4 Rue du Theatre-Francais, where he
published liberal pamphlets, also his _Bien Informe_.Then, in 1794, he
printed in French the "Age of Reason."He also published, and probably
translated into French, Paine's letter to the now exiled Camille
Jordan,--"Lettre de Thomas Paine, sur les Cultes."Paine, unable to
converse in French, found with the Bonnevilles a home he needed.M. and
Madame Bonneville had been married three years, and their second child
had been named after Thomas Paine, who stood as his godfather.Paine,
as we learn from Rickman, who knew the Bonnevilles, paid board, but no
doubt he aided Bonneville more by his pen.With public affairs, either in France or America, Paine now mingled but
little.The election of John Adams to the presidency he heard of with
dismay.He wrote to Jefferson that since he was not president, he was
glad he had accepted the vice-presidency, "for John Adams has such a
talent for blundering and offending, it will be necessary to keep an eye
over him."Finding, by the abandonment of a descent on.England for
one on Egypt, that Napoleon was by no means his ideal missionary of
republicanism, he withdrew into his little study, and now remained so
quiet that some English papers announced his arrival and cool reception
in America.He was, however, fairly bored with visitors from all parts
of the world, curious to see the one international republican left.It became necessary for Madame Bonneville, armed with polite
prevarications, to defend him from such sight-seers.For what with
his visits to and from the Barlows, the Smiths, and his friends of the
Directory, Paine had too little time for the inventions in which he was
again absorbed,--his "Saints."Among his intimate friends at this time
was Robert Fulton, then residing in Paris.Paine's extensive studies
of the steam-engine, and his early discovery, of its adaptability to
navigation, had caused Rumsey to seek him in England, and Fitch to
consult him both in America and Paris.Paine's connection with the
invention of the steamboat was recognized by Fulton, as indeed by all of
his scientific contemporaries.* To Fulton he freely gave his ideas,
and may perhaps have had some hope that the steamboat might prove a
missionary of international republicanism, though Napoleon had failed.* Sir Richard Phillips says: "In 1778 Thomas Paine proposed,
     in America, this application of steam."("Million of Facts,"
     p.As Sir Richard assisted Fulton in his experiments
     on the Thames, he probably heard from him the fact about
     Paine, though, indeed, in the controversy between Rumsey and
     Fitch, Paine's priority to both was conceded.In America,
     however, the priority really belonged to the eminent
     mechanician William Henry, of Lancaster, Pa.When Fitch
     visited Henry, in 1785, he was told by him that he was not
     the first to devise steam-navigation; that he himself had
     thought of it in 1776, and mentioned it to Andrew Ellicott;
     and that Thomas Paine, while a guest at his house in 1778,
     had spoken to him on the subject I am indebted to Mr.John
     W. Jordan, of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, for
     notes from the papers of Henry, his ancestor, showing that
     Paine's scheme was formed without knowledge of others, and
     that it contemplated a turbine application of steam to a
     wheel.Both he and Henry, as they had not published their
     plans, agreed to leave Fitch the whole credit.Fitch
     publicly expressed his gratitude to Paine.Thurston adds
     that Paine, in 1788, proposed that Congress should adopt the
     whole matter for the national benefit.("History of the
     Growth of the Steam Engine," pp.It will not be forgotten that in the same year in which Paine startled
William Henry with a plan for steam-navigation, namely in 1778, he wrote
his sublime sentence about the "Religion of Humanity."The steamships,
which Emerson described as enormous shuttles weaving the races of
men into the woof of humanity, have at length rendered possible that
universal human religion which Paine foresaw.In that old Lancaster
mansion of the Henrys, which still stands, Paine left his spectacles,
now in our National Museum; they are strong and far-seeing; through them
looked eyes held by visions that the world is still steadily following.One cannot suppress some transcendental sentiment in view of
the mystical harmony of this man's inventions for human
welfare,--mechanical, political, religious.Of his gunpowder motor,
mention has already been made (i., p.On this he was engaged
about the time that he was answering Bishop Watson's book on the "Age of
Reason."He could not believe, he said,
that the qualities of gunpowder--the small and light grain with maximum
of force--were meant only for murder, and his faith in the divine
humanity is in the sentence.To supersede destroying gunpowder with
beneficent gunpowder, and to supersede the god of battles with the God
of Love, were kindred aims in Paine's heart Through the fiery furnaces
of his time he had come forth with every part of his being welded and
beaten and shaped together for this Human Service.Patriotism, in the
conventional sense, race-pride, sectarianism, partizanship, had been
burnt out of his nature.The universe could not have wrung from his
tongue approval of a wrong because it was done by his own country.It might be supposed that there were no heavier trials awaiting Paine's
political faith than those it had undergone.But it was becoming evident
that liberty had not the advantage he once ascribed to truth over
error,--"it cannot be unlearned."The United States had unlearned it as
far as to put into the President's hands a power of arbitrarily crushing
political opponents, such as even George III.The
British Treaty had begun to bear its natural fruits.Washington signed
the Treaty to avoid war, and rendered war inevitable with both France
and England.The affair with France was happily a transient squall, but
it was sufficient to again bring on Paine the offices of an American
Minister in France.Many an American in that country had occasion to
appreciate his powerful aid and unfailing kindness.Among these was
Captain Rowland Crocker of Massachusetts, who had sailed with a letter
of marque.'His vessel was captured by the French, and its wounded
commander brought to Paris, where he was more agreeably conquered by
kindness.Freeman's "History of Cape Cod" (of which region Crocker was a
native) has the following:

"His [Captain Crocker's] reminiscences of his residence in that country,
during the most extraordinary period of its history, were of a highly
interesting character.He had taken the great Napoleon by the hand; he
had familiarly known Paine, at a time when his society was sought for
and was valuable.Of this noted individual, we may in passing say, with
his uniform and characteristic kindness, he always spoke in terms which
sounded strange to the ears of a generation which has been taught, with
or without justice, to regard the author of 'The Age of Reason' with
loathing and abhorrence.He remembered Paine as a well-dressed and most
gentlemanly man, of sound and orthodox republican principles, of a good
heart, a strong intellect, and a fascinating address."{1799}

The _coup d'etat_ in America, which made President Adams virtual
emperor, pretended constitutionality, and was reversible.That which
Napoleon and Sieves--who had his way at last--effected in France
(November 9, 1799) was lawless and fatal.The peaceful Bonneville home
was broken up.Bonneville, in his _Bien Informe_ described Napoleon as
"a Cromwell," and was promptly imprisoned.Paine, either before or soon
after this catastrophe, went to Belgium, on a visit to his old friend
Vanhuile, who had shared his cell in the Luxembourg prison.Vanhuile
was now president of the municipality of Bruges, and Paine got from him
information about European affairs.On his return he found Bonneville
released from prison, but under severe surveillance, his journal being
suppressed.The family was thus reduced to penury and anxiety, but there
was all the more reason that Paine should stand by them.He continued
his abode in their house, now probably supported by drafts on his
resources in America, to which country they turned their thoughts.{1800}

The European Republic on land having become hopeless, Paine turned
his attention to the seas.He wrote a pamphlet on "Maritime Compact,"
including in it ten articles for the security of neutral commerce, to
be signed by the nations entering the "Unarmed Association," which he
proposed.This scheme was substantially the same as that already quoted
from his letter "To the People of France, and to the French Armies."It was translated by Bonneville, and widely circulated in Europe.Paine
sent it in manuscript to Jefferson, who at once had it printed.His
accompanying letter to Jefferson (October i, 1800) is of too much
biographical interest to be abridged.* Oliver Ellsworth, William V. Murray, and William R. Davie,
     were sent by President Adams to France to negotiate a
     treaty.There is little doubt that the famous letter of Joel
     Barlow to Washington, October 2, 1798, written in the
     interest of peace, was composed after consultation with
     Paine.Adams, on reading the letter, abused Barlow."Tom
     Paine," he said, "is not a more worthless fellow."But he
     obeyed the letter.The Commissioners he sent were associated
     with the anti-French and British party in America, but peace
     with America was of too much importance to the new despot of
     France for the opportunity to be missed of forming a Treaty."Dear Sir,--I wrote to you from Havre by the ship Dublin Packet in the
year 1797.It was then my intention to return to America; but there were
so many British frigates cruising in sight of the port, and which after
a few days knew that I was at Havre waiting to go to America, that I did
not think it best to trust myself to their discretion, and the more so,
as I had no confidence in the Captain of the Dublin Packet (Clay).I
mentioned to you in that letter, which I believe you received thro'
the hands of Colonel [Aaron] Burr, that I was glad since you were not
President that you had accepted the nomination of Vice President.have been here about eight months,
and three more useless mortals never came upon public business.Their
presence appears to me to have been rather an injury than a benefit They
set themselves up for a faction as soon as they arrived.Upon my return to Paris I learned they had made a point of not
returning the visits of Mr.Skipwith and Barlow, because, they said,
they had not the confidence of the executive.Every known republican was
treated in the same manner.Miller of Philadelphia,
who had occasion to see them upon business, that they did not intend to
return my visit, if I made one.This I supposed it was intended I should
know, that I might not make one.I told him, I did not come to see him as a
commissioner, nor to congratulate him upon his mission; that I came to
see him because I had formerly known him in Congress.I mean not, said
I, to press you with any questions, or to engage you in any conversation
upon the business you are come upon, but I will nevertheless candidly
say that I know not what expectations the Government or the people of
America may have of your mission, or what expectations you may have
yourselves, but I believe you will find you can do but little.The
treaty with England lies at the threshold of all your business.The
American Government never did two more foolish things than when it
signed that Treaty and recalled Mr.Monroe, who was the only man could
do them any service.Ellsworth put on the dull gravity of a Judge,
and was silent.I added, you may perhaps make a treaty like that you
have made with England, which is a surrender of the rights of the
American flag; for the principle that neutral ships make neutral
property must be general or not at all.I then changed the subject, for
I had all the talk to myself upon this topic, and enquired after Sam.Adams, (I asked nothing about John,) Mr.Monroe, and
others of my friends, and the melancholy case of the yellow fever,--of
which he gave me as circumstantial an account as if he had been summing
up a case to a Jury.Ellsworth been as
cunning as a statesman, or as wise as a Judge, he would have returned my
visit that he might appear insensible of the intention of mine."I now come to the affairs of this country and of Europe.You will, I
suppose, have heard before this arrives to you, of the battle of
Marengo in Italy, where the Austrians were defeated--of the armistice
in consequence thereof, and the surrender of Milan, Genoa, etc., to
the french--of the successes of the french army in Germany--and the
extension of the armistice in that quarter--of the preliminaries of
peace signed at Paris--of the refusal of the Emperor [of Austria] to
ratify these preliminaries--of the breaking of the armistice by the
french Government in consequence of that refusal--of the 'gallant'
expedition of the Emperor to put himself at the head of his Army--of his
pompous arrival there--of his having made his will--of prayers being put
in all his churches for the preservation of the life of this Hero--of
General Moreau announcing to him, immediately on his arrival at the
Army, that hostilities would commence the day after the next at sunrise,
unless he signed the treaty or gave security that he would sign within
45 days--of his surrendering up three of the principal keys of Germany
(Ulm, Philipsbourg, and Ingolstad), as security that he would sign them.This is the state things [they] are now in, at the time of writing this
letter; but it is proper to add that the refusal of the Emperor to sign
the preliminaries was motived upon a note from the King of England to be
admitted to the Congress for negociating Peace, which was consented to
by the french upon the condition of an armistice at Sea, which England,
before knowing of the surrender the Emperor had made, had refused.From
all which it appears to me, judging from circumstances, that the Emperor
is now so compleatly in the hands of the french, that he has no way of
getting out but by a peace.The Congress for the peace is to be held
at Luneville, a town in france.Since the affair of Rastadt the french
commissioners will not trust themselves within the Emperor's territory.I know not what the Commissioners have
done, but from a paper I enclose to you, which appears to have
some authority, it is not much.The paper as you will perceive is
considerably prior to this letter.I knew that the Commissioners before
this piece appeared intended setting off.It is therefore probable that
what they have done is conformable to what this paper mentions, which
certainly will not atone for the expence their mission has incurred,
neither are they, by all the accounts I hear of them, men fitted for the
business."But independently of these matters there appears to be a state of
circumstances rising, which if it goes on, will render all partial
treaties unnecessary.In the first place I doubt if any peace will be
made with England; and in the second place, I should not wonder to see a
coalition formed against her, to compel her to abandon her insolence on
the seas.This brings me to speak of the manuscripts I send you.1, without any title, was written in consequence of
a question put to me by Bonaparte.As he supposed I knew England
and English Politics he sent a person to me to ask, that in case of
negociating a Peace with Austria, whether it would be proper to include
England.Julian was in Paris, on the part of the
Emperor negociating the preliminaries:--which as I have before said the
Emperor refused to sign on the pretence of admitting England.2, entitled _On the Jacobinism of the English at
Sea_, was written when the English made their insolent and impolitic
expedition to Denmark, and is also an auxiliary to the politic of No.I shewed it to a friend [Bonneville] who had it translated into french,
and printed in the form of a Pamphlet, and distributed gratis among the
foreign Ministers, and persons in the Government.It was immediately
copied into several of the french Journals, and into the official Paper,
the Moniteur.It appeared in this paper one day before the last
dispatch arrived from Egypt; which agreed perfectly with what I had said
respecting Egypt.It hit the two cases of Denmark and Egypt in the exact
proper moment.3, entitled _Compact Maritime_, is the sequel of No.It is translating at the time I write this letter,
and I am to have a meeting with the Senator Garat upon the subject.The pieces 2 and 3 go off in manuscript to England, by a confidential
person, where they will be published."By all the news we get from the North there appears to be something
meditating against England.It is now given for certain that Paul has
embargoed all the English vessels and English property in Russia till
some principle be established for protecting the Rights of neutral
Nations, and securing the liberty of the Seas.The preparations in
Denmark continue, notwithstanding the convention that she has made with
England, which leaves the question with respect to the right set up by
England to stop and search Neutral vessels undecided.I send you the
paragraphs upon the subject."The tumults are great in all parts of England on account of the
excessive price of corn and bread, which has risen since the harvest.I attribute it more to the abundant increase of paper, and the
non-circulation of cash, than to any other cause, People in trade
can push the paper off as fast as they receive it, as they did by
continental money in America; but as farmers have not this opportunity
they endeavor to secure themselves by going considerably in advance."I have now given you all the great articles of intelligence, for I
trouble not myself with little ones, and consequently not with the
Commissioners, nor any thing they are about, nor with John Adams,
otherwise than to wish him safe home, and a better and wiser man in his
place."In the present state of circumstances and the prospects arising from
them, it may be proper for America to consider whether it is worth her
while to enter into any treaty at this moment, or to wait the event of
those circumstances which, if they go on will render partial treaties
useless by deranging them.But if, in the mean time, she enters into
any treaty it ought to be with a condition to the following purpose:
Reserving to herself the right of joining in an association of Nations
for the protection of the Rights of Neutral Commerce and the security of
the liberty of the Seas."The pieces 2, 3, may go to the press.They will make a small pamphlet
and the printers are welcome to put my name to it.It is best it should
be put from thence; they will get into the newspapers.I know that the
faction of John Adams abuses me pretty heartily.It
does not disturb me, and they lose their labour; and in return for it I
am doing America more service, as a neutral nation, than their expensive
Commissioners can do, and she has that service from me for nothing.1 is only for your own amusement and that of your friends."I come now to speak confidentially to you on a private subject.Ellsworth and Davie return to America, Murray will return to
Holland, and in that case there will be nobody in Paris but Mr.Skipwith
that has been in the habit of transacting business with the french
Government since the revolution began.He is on a good standing with
them, and if the chance of the day should place you in the presidency
you cannot do better than appoint him for any purpose you may have
occasion for in France.He is an honest man and will do his country
Justice, and that with civility and good manners to the government he
is commissioned to act with; a faculty which that Northern Bear Timothy
Pickering wanted, and which the Bear of that Bear, John Adams, never
possessed.Murray, otherwise than of his unfriendliness to
every American who is not of his faction, but I am sure that Joel Barlow
is a much fitter man to be in Holland than Mr.It is upon
the fitness of the man to the place that I speak, for I have not
communicated a thought upon the subject to Barlow, neither does he
know, at the time of my writing this (for he is at Havre), that I have
intention to do it."I will now, by way of relief, amuse you with some account of the
progress of Iron Bridges.Burke's attack
upon it, drew me off from any pontifical Works.Since my coming from
England in '92, an Iron Bridge of a single arch 236 feet span versed
sine 34 feet, has been cast at the Iron Works of the Walkers where my
model was, and erected over the river Wear at Sunderland in the county
of Durham in England.The two members in Parliament for the County,
Mr.Milbank, were the principal subscribers; but the
direction was committed to Mr.A very sincere friend of mine,
Sir Robert Smyth, who lives in france, and whom Mr.Monroe well knows,
supposing they had taken their plan from my model wrote to Mr.Milbank answered the letter, which answer I have
by me and I give you word for word the part concerning the Bridge: 'With
respect to the Bridge over the river Wear at Sunderland it certainly is
a Work well deserving admiration both for its structure, durability
and utility, and I have good grounds for saying that the first Idea was
taken from Mr.Paine's bridge exhibited at Paddington.But with respect
to any compensation to Mr.Paine, however desirous of rewarding the
labours of an ingenious man, I see not how it is in my power, having had
nothing to do with his bridge after the payment of my subscription, Mr.But if you can point out
any mode by which I can be instrumental in procuring for Mr.P. any
compensation for the advantages which the public may have derived from
his ingenious model, from which certainly the outlines of the Bridge
at Sunderland was taken, be assured it will afford me very great
satisfaction.'"I have now made two other models, one is pasteboard, five feet span
and five inches of height from the cords.It is in the opinion of every
person who has seen it one of the most beautiful objects the eye can
behold.I then cast a model in Metal following the construction of that
in pasteboard and of the same dimensions.The whole was executed in my
own Chamber.It is far superior in strength, elegance, and readiness in
execution to the model I made in America, and which you saw in Paris.I
shall bring those Models with me when I come home, which will be as soon
as I can pass the seas in safety from the piratical John Bulls."I suppose you have seen, or have heard of the Bishop of Landaff's
answer to my second part of the Age of reason.As soon as I got a
copy of it I began a third part, which served also as an answer to the
Bishop; but as soon as the clerical Society for promoting _Christian
Knowledge_ knew of my intention to answer the Bishop, they prosecuted,
as a Society, the printer of the first and second parts, to prevent that
answer appearing.No other reason than this can be assigned for their
prosecuting at the time they did, because the first part had been in
circulation above three years and the second part more than one, and
they prosecuted immediately on knowing that I was taking up their
Champion.Burke's attack on the french
revolution; served me as a back-ground to bring forward other subjects
upon, with more advantage than if the background was not there.This is
the motive that induced me to answer him, otherwise I should have gone
on without taking any notice of him.I have made and am still making
additions to the manuscript, and shall continue to do so till an
opportunity arrive for publishing it."If any American frigate should come to france, and the direction of
it fall to you, I will be glad you would give me the opportunity of
returning.The abscess under which I suffered almost two years is
entirely healed of itself, and I enjoy exceeding good health.This is
the first of October, and Mr.Skipwith has just called to tell me the
Commissioners set off for Havre tomorrow.This will go by the frigate
but not with the knowledge of the Commissioners.Remember me with much
affection to my friends and accept the same to yourself."As the Commissioners did not leave when they expected, Paine added
several other letters to Jefferson, on public affairs.In one (October
1st) he says he has information of increasing aversion in the English
people to their government."It was the hope of conquest, and is now the
hope of peace that keeps it [Pitt's administration] up."When
suspicion wakes the credit vanishes as the dream would.""England has a
large Navy, and the expense of it leads to her ruin."The English nation
is tired of war, longs for peace, "and calculates upon defeat as
it would upon victory."On October 4th, after the Commissioners had
concluded a treaty, Paine alludes to an article said to be in it,
requiring certain expenditures in France, and says that if he,
Jefferson, be "in the chair, and not otherwise," he should offer himself
for this business, should an agent be required "It will serve to defray
my expenses until I can return, but I wish it may be with the condition
of returning.I am not tired of working for nothing, but I cannot afford
it.This appointment will aid me in promoting the object I am now upon
of a law of nations for the protection of neutral commerce."On October
6th he reports to Jefferson that at an entertainment given the American
envoys, Consul Le Brun gave the toast: "A l'union de l'Amerique avec les
puissances du Nord pour faire respecter la liberte des mers."On October
15th the last of his enclosures to Jefferson is written.He says that
Napoleon, when asked if there would be more war, replied: "Nous
n'aurions plus qu'une guerre d'ecritoire."In all of Paine's writing
about Napoleon, at this time, he seems as if watching a thundercloud,
and trying to make out meteorologically its drift, and where it will
strike.{1801}

On July 15, 1801, Napoleon concluded with Pius VII.Naturally, the first victim offered on the restored altar was
Theophilan-thropy.I have called Paine the founder of this Society,
because it arose amid the controversy excited by the publication of "Le
Siecle de la Raison," its manual and tracts reproducing his ideas and
language; and because he gave the inaugural discourse.Theism was little
known in France save as iconoclasm, and an assault on the Church: Paine
treated it as a Religion.But, as he did not speak French, the practical
organization and management of the Society were the work of others, and
mainly of a Russian named Hauey.There had been a good deal of odium
incurred at first by a society which satisfied neither the pious nor the
freethinkers, but it found a strong friend on the Directory.This
was Larevelliere-Lepeaux, whose secretary, Antoine Vallee, and young
daughter, had become interested in the movement.This statesman never
joined the Society, but he had attended one of its meetings, and, when
a distribution of religious edifices was made, Theophilanthropy was
assigned ten parish churches.It is said that when Larevelliere-Lepeaux
mentioned to Talleyrand his desire for the spread of this Society, the
diplomat said: "All you have to do is to get yourself hanged, and revive
the third day."Paine, who had pretty nearly fulfilled that requirement,
saw the Society spread rapidly, and he had great hopes of its future.also had an interested eye on it, and though the
Concordat did not go into legal operation until 1802, Theophilanthropy
was offered as a preliminary sacrifice in October, 1801.The description of Paine by Walter Savage Landor, and representations
of his talk, in the "Imaginary Conversations," so mix up persons, times,
and places, that I was at one time inclined to doubt whether the two had
met.J. M. Wheeler, a valued correspondent in London, writes
me: "Landor told my friend Mr.Birch of Florence that he particularly
admired Paine, and that he visited him, having first obtained an
interview at the house of General Dumouriez.Landor declared that Paine
was always called 'Tom,' not out of disrespect, but because he was a
jolly good fellow."An interview with Paine at the house of Dumouriez
could only have occurred when the General was in Paris, in 1793.This
would account for what Landor says of Paine taking refuge from trouble
in brandy.There had been, as, Rickman testifies, and as all the facts
show, nothing of this kind since that period.It would appear therefore
that Landor must have mixed up at least two interviews with Paine, one
in the time of Dumouriez, the other in that of Napoleon.Not even
such an artist as Landor could invent the language ascribed to Paine
concerning the French and Napoleon."The whole nation may be made as enthusiastic about a salad as about a
constitution; about the colour of a cockade as about a consul or a king.You will shortly see the real strength and figure of Bonaparte.He is
wilful, headstrong, proud, morose, presumptuous; he will be guided no
longer; he has pulled the pad from his forehead, and will break his nose
or bruise his cranium against every table, chair, and brick in the room,
until at last he must be sent to the hospital."Paine prophesies that Napoleon will make himself emperor, and that "by
his intemperate use of power and thirst of dominion" he will cause the
people to "wish for their old kings, forgetting what beasts they were."Normandy" Landor disguises Thomas Poole,
referred to on a preceding page.Normandy's sufferings on account of one
of Paine's books are not exaggerated.Sanford's work is printed
a letter from Paris, July 20, 1802, in which Poole says: "I called one
Morning on Thomas Paine.Striking,
strong physiognomy.Said a great many quaint things, and read us part of
a reply which he intends to publish to Watson's 'Apology.'"* "Thomas Poole and His Friends," ii., p.Paine seems to have had no relation with the ruling powers at this time,
though an Englishman who visited him is quoted by Rickman (p.198) as
remarking his manliness and fearlessness, and that he spoke as freely as
ever after Bonaparte's supremacy.One communication only to any member
of the government appears; this was to the Minister of the Interior
concerning a proposed iron bridge over the Seine.* Political France and
Paine had parted.Under date of March 18, 1801, President Jefferson informs Paine that he
had sent his manuscripts (Maritime Compact) to the printer to be made
into a pamphlet, and that the American people had returned from their
frenzy against France.He adds:

"You expressed a wish to get a passage to this country in a public
vessel.Dawson is charged with orders to the captain of the Maryland
to receive and accommodate you back if you can be ready to depart
at such short warning.R. Livingston is appointed minister
plenipotentiary to the republic of France, but will not leave this till
we receive the ratification of the convention by Mr.** I am in
hopes you will find us returned generally to sentiments worthy of former
times.In these it will be your glory to have steadily labored, and with
as much effect as any man living.That you may long live to continue
your useful labors and to reap the reward in the thankfulness of
nations, is my sincere prayer.Accept assurances of my high esteem and
affectionate attachment."*  "The Minister of the Interior to Thomas Paine: I have
     received, Citizen, the observations that you have been so
     good as to address to me upon the construction of iron
     bridges.They will be of the greatest utility to us when the
     new kind of construction goes to be executed for the first
     time.With pleasure I assure you, Citizen, that you have
     rights of more than one kind to the gratitude of nations,
     and I give you, cordially, the expression of my particular
     esteem.--Chaptal."It is rather droll, considering the appropriation of his
     patent in England, and the confiscation of a thousand pounds
     belonging to him, to find Paine casually mentioning that at
     this time a person came from London with plans and drawings
     to consult with him about an iron arch of 600 feet, over the
     Thames, then under consideration by a committee of the House
     of Commons.**  "Beau Dawson," an eminent Virginia Congressman.The subjoined notes are from letters of Paine to Jefferson:

_Paris, June 9, 1801_.Dawson gave me
the real sensation of happy satisfaction, and what served to increase
it was that he brought it to me himself before I knew of his arrival.There has been no circumstance
with respect to America since the times of her revolution that excited
so much attention and expectation in France, England, Ireland, and
Scotland as the pending election for President of the United States, nor
any of which the event has given more general joy:

"I thank you for the opportunity you give me of returning by the
Maryland, but I shall wait the return of the vessel that brings Mr."The Parliamentaire, from America to Havre,
was taken in going out, and carried into England.The pretence, as the
papers say, was that a Swedish Minister was on board for America.If
I had happened to have been there, I suppose they would have made no
ceremony in conducting me on shore."*




{1802}

_Paris, March 17,1802_."As it is now Peace, though the definitive
Treaty is not yet signed, I shall set off by the first opportunity from
Havre or Dieppe, after the equinoctial gales are over.I continue in
excellent health, which I know your friendship will be glad to hear
of.--Wishing you and America every happiness, I remain your former
fellow-labourer and much obliged fellow-citizen."Paine's determination not to return to America in a national vessel was
owing to a paragraph he saw in a Baltimore paper, headed "Out at Last."It stated that Paine had written to the President, expressing a wish to
return by a national ship, and that "permission was given."There was
here an indication that Jefferson's invitation to Paine by the Hon.John
Dawson had become known to the President's enemies, and that Jefferson,
on being attacked, had apologized by making the matter appear an act
of charity.Paine would not believe that the President was personally
responsible for the apologetic paragraph, which seemed inconsistent with
the cordiality of the letter brought by Dawson; but, as he afterwards
wrote to Jefferson, "it determined me not to come by a national ship."*
His request had been made at a time when any other than a national
American ship was pretty certain to land him in an English prison.There
was evidently no thought of any _eclat_ in the matter, but no doubt a
regard for economy as well as safety.Jefferson had been charged
     with sending a national ship to France for the sole purpose
     of bringing Paine home, and Paine himself would have been
     the first to condemn such an assumption of power.Although
     the President's adherents thought it right to deny this,
     Jefferson wrote to Paine that he had nothing to do with the
     paragraph."With respect to the letter [offering the ship] I
     never hesitate to avow and justify it in conversation.In no
     other way do I trouble myself to contradict anything which
     is said.At that time, however, there were anomalies in the
     motions of some of our friends which events have at length
     reduced to regularity."The following to the eminent deist lecturer in New York, Elihu Palmer,
bears the date, "Paris, February 21, 1802, since the Fable of Christ":

"Dear Friend, I received, by Mr.Livingston, the letter you wrote me,
and the excellent work you have published ["The Principles of Nature"].I see you have thought deeply on the subject, and expressed your
thoughts in a strong and clear style.The hinting and intimating manner
of writing that was formerly used on subjects of this kind, produced
skepticism, but not conviction.Some people
can be reasoned into sense, and others must be shocked into it.Say a
bold thing that will stagger them, and they will begin to think."There is an intimate friend of mine, Colonel Joseph Kirk-bride of
Bordentown, New Jersey, to whom I would wish you to send your work.He
is an excellent man, and perfectly in our sentiments.You can send it by
the stage that goes partly by land and partly by water, between New York
and Philadelphia, and passes through Bordentown."I expect to arrive in America in May next.I have a third part of the
Age of Reason to publish when I arrive, which, if I mistake not, will
make a stronger impression than any thing I have yet published on the
subject."I write this by an ancient colleague of mine in the French Convention,
the citizen Lequinio, who is going [as] Consul to Rhode Island, and who
waits while I write.The following, dated July 8, 1802, to Consul Rotch, is the last letter I
find written by Paine from Paris:

"My Dear Friend,--The bearer of this is a young man that wishes to go
to America.He is willing to do anything on board a ship to lesson the
expense of his passage.If you know any captain to whom such a person
may be usefull I will be obliged to you to speak to him about it.Otte was to come to Paris in order to go to America, I wanted
to take a passage with him, but as he stays in England to negociate some
arrangements of Commerce, I have given up that idea.I wait now for the
arrival of a person from England whom I want to see,** after which, I
shall bid adieu to restless and wretched Europe.I am with affectionate
esteem to you and Mrs.Rotch,

"Yours,

"Thomas Paine."* J. M. Lequinio, author of "Prejudices Destroyed," and
     other rationalistic works, especially dealt with in
     Priestley's "Letters to the Philosophers of France."The President's cordial letter had raised a happy vision before the eyes
of one sitting amid the ruins of his republican world.As he said of
Job, he had "determined, in the midst of accumulating ills, to impose
upon himself the hard duty of contentment."Of the comrades with whom he
began the struggle for liberty in France but a small circle remained.As he wrote to Lady Smith,--from whom he must now part,--"I might almost
say like Job's servant, 'and I only am escaped.'"Of the American and
English friends who cared for him when he came out of prison few remain.The President's letter came to a poor man in a small room, furnished
only with manuscripts and models of inventions.Here he was found by
an old friend from England, Henry Redhead Yorke, who, in 1795, had been
tried in England for sedition.Yorke has left us a last glimpse of the
author in "wretched and restless Europe."The "rights of man" had become
so antiquated in Napoleon's France, that Yorke found Paine's name odious
on account of his antislavery writings, the people "ascribing to his
espousal of the rights of the <DW64>s of St.Domingo the resistance
which Leclercq had experienced from them."A "jolly-looking woman" (in whom we recognize
Madame Bonneville) scrutinized Yorke severely, but was smiling enough
on learning that he was Paine's old friend.He was ushered into a little
room heaped with boxes of documents, a chaos of pamphlets and journals.While Yorke was meditating on the contrast between this habitation of a
founder of two great republics and the mansions of their rulers, his old
friend entered, dressed in a long flannel gown."Time seemed to have made dreadful ravages over his whole frame, and a
settled melancholy was visible on his countenance.He desired me to be
seated, and although he did not recollect me for a considerable time,
he conversed with his usual affability.I confess I felt extremely
surprised that he should have forgotten me; but I resolved not to make
myself known to him, as long as it could be avoided with propriety.In
order to try his memory, I referred to a number of circumstances which
had occurred while we were in company, but carefully abstained from
hinting that we had ever lived together.He would frequently put his
hand to his forehead, and exclaim, 'Ah!I know that voice, but my
recollection fails!'At length I thought it time to remove his suspense,
and stated an incident which instantly recalled me to his mind.It
is impossible to describe the sudden change which this effected; his
countenance brightened, he pressed me by the hand, and a silent tear
stole down his cheek.For some
time we sat without a word escaping from our lips.'Thus are we met once
more, Mr.Paine,' I resumed, 'after a long separation of ten years,
and after having been both of us severely weather-beaten.''Aye,' he
replied, 'and who would have thought that we should meet in Paris?'He then enquired what motive had brought me here, and on my explaining
myself, he observed with a smile of contempt, 'They have shed blood
enough for liberty, and now they have it in perfection.This is not a
country for an honest man to live in; they do not understand any thing
at all of the principles of free government, and the best way is to
leave them to themselves.You see they have conquered all Europe, only
to make it more miserable than it was before.'Upon this, I remarked
that I was surprised to hear him speak in such desponding language of
the fortune of mankind, and that I thought much might yet be done for
the Republic.he exclaimed, 'do you call this a Republic?Why they are worse off than the slaves of Constantinople; for there,
they expect to be bashaws in heaven by submitting to be slaves below,
but here they believe neither in heaven nor hell, and yet are slaves by
choice.I know of no Republic in the world except America, which is the
only country for such men as you and I. It is my intention to get away
from this place as soon as possible, and I hope to be off in the autumn;
you are a young man and may see better times, but I have done with
Europe, and its slavish politics.'"I have often been in company with Mr.Paine, since my arrival here, and
I was not a little surprised to find him wholly indifferent about the
public spirit in England, or the remaining influence of his doctrines
among its people.Indeed he seemed to dislike the mention of the
subject; and when, one day, in order to provoke discussion, I told him
I had altered my opinions upon many of his principles, he answered, 'You
certainly have the right to do so; but you cannot alter the nature
of things; the French have alarmed all honest men; but still truth is
truth.Though you may not think that my principles are practicable in
England, without bringing on a great deal of misery and confusion, you
are, I am sure, convinced of their justice.'Here he took occasion to
speak in terms of the utmost severity of Mr------, who had obtained
a seat in parliament, and said that 'parsons were always mischievous
fellows when they turned politicians.'This gave rise to an observation
respecting his 'Age of Reason,' the publication of which I said had
lost him the good opinion of numbers of his English advocates.He
became uncommonly warm at this remark, and in a tone of singular energy
declared that he would not have published it if he had not thought it
calculated to 'inspire mankind with a more exalted idea of the Supreme
Architect of the Universe, and to put an end to villainous imposture.'He then broke out with the most violent invectives against our received
opinions, accompanying them at the same time with some of the most grand
and sublime conceptions of an Omnipotent Being, that I ever heard or
read of.In the support of his opinion, he avowed himself ready to
lay down his life, and said 'the Bishop of Llandaff may roast me in
Smithfield if he likes, but human torture cannot shake my conviction.'He reached down a copy of the Bishop's work, interleaved with remarks
upon it, which he read me; after which he admitted the liberality of
the Bishop, and regretted that in all controversies among men a similar
temper was not maintained.But in proportion as he appeared listless in
politics, he seemed quite a zealot in his religious creed; of which the
following is an instance.An English lady of our acquaintance, not less
remarkable for her talents than for elegance of manners, entreated me to
contrive that she might have an interview with Mr.In consequence
of this I invited him to dinner on a day when we were to be favoured
with her company.But as she is a very rigid Roman Catholic I cautioned
Mr.Paine, beforehand, against touching upon religious subjects,
assuring him at the same time that she felt much interested to make his
acquaintance.With much good nature he promised to be _discreet_.... For
above four hours he kept every one in astonishment and admiration of
his memory, his keen observation of men and manners, his numberless
anecdotes of the American Indians, of the American war, of Franklin,
Washington, and even of his Majesty, of whom he told several curious
facts of humour and benevolence.His remarks on genius and taste can
never be forgotten by those present.Thus far everything went on as I
could wish; the sparkling champagne gave a zest to his conversation,
and we were all delighted.an expression relating to his
'Age of Reason' having been mentioned by one of the company, he broke
out immediately.He began with Astronomy,--addressing himself to Mrs.Y.,--he declared that the least inspection of the motion of the stars
was a convincing proof that Moses was a liar.In
vain I attempted to change the subject, by employing every artifice in
my power, and even attacking with vehemence his political principles.He returned to the charge with unabated ardour.I called upon him for a
song though I never heard him sing in my life.He struck up one of
his own composition; but the instant he had finished it he resumed his
favourite topic.I felt extremely mortified, and remarked that he had
forgotten his promise, and that it was not fair to wound so deeply the
opinions of the ladies.said he, 'they 'll come again.What a pity
it is that people should be so prejudiced!'To which I retorted that
their prejudices might be virtues.'If so,' he replied, 'the blossoms
may be beautiful to the eye, but the root is weak.'One of the most
extraordinary properties belonging to Mr.Paine is his power of
retaining everything he has written in the course of his life.It is
a fact that he can repeat word for word every sentence in his 'Common
Sense,' 'Rights of Man,' etc., etc.The Bible is the only book which he
has studied, and there is not a verse in it that is not familiar to him.In shewing me one day the beautiful models of two bridges he had devised
he observed that Dr.Franklin once told him that 'books are written to
please, houses built for great men, churches for priests, but no bridges
for the people.'These models exhibit an extraordinary degree not only
of skill but of taste; and are wrought with extreme delicacy entirely
by his own hands.The largest is nearly four feet in length; the iron
works, the chains, and every other article belonging to it, were forged
and manufactured by himself.It is intended as the model of a bridge
which is to be constructed across the Delaware, extending 480 feet with
only one arch.The other is to be erected over a lesser river,
whose name I forget, and is likewise a single arch, and of his own
workmanship, excepting the chains, which, instead of iron, are cut out
of pasteboard, by the fair hand of his correspondent the 'Little Corner
of the World,' whose indefatigable perseverance is extraordinary.He was
offered L3000 for these models and refused it.The iron bars, which
I before mentioned that I noticed in a corner of his room, were also
forged by himself, as the model of a crane, of a new description.He put
them together, and exhibited the power of the lever to a most surprising
degree."'*"Letters from France," etc., London, 1804, 2 vols., 8vo.Thirty-three pages of the last letter are devoted to Paine.About this time Sir Robert Smith died, and another of the ties to Paris
was snapped.His beloved Bonnevilles promised to follow him to the New
World.His old friend Rickman has come over to see him off, and observed
that "he did not drink spirits, and wine he took moderately; he even
objected to any spirits being laid in as a part of his sea-stock."These
two friends journeyed together to Havre, where, on September 1st, the
way-worn man begins his homeward voyage.Poor Rickman, the perpetually
prosecuted, strains his eyes till the sail is lost, then sits on the
beach and writes his poetical tribute to Jefferson and America for
recalling Paine, and a touching farewell to his friend:

     "Thus smooth be thy waves, and thus gentle the breeze,
     As thou bearest my Paine far away;
     O waft him to comfort and regions of ease,
     Each blessing of freedom and friendship to seize,
     And bright be his setting sun's ray."Who can imagine the joy of those eyes when they once more beheld the
distant coast of the New World!Fifteen years have passed,--years
in which all nightmares became real, and liberty's sun had turned to
blood,--since he saw the happy land fading behind him.Oh, America,
thine old friend who first claimed thy republican independence, who laid
aside his Quaker coat and fought for thy cause, believing it sacred, is
returning to thy breast!This is the man of whom Washington wrote: "His
writings certainly had a powerful effect on the public mind,--ought they
not then to meet an adequate return?It is
not money he needs now, but tenderness, sympathy; for he comes back from
an old world that has plundered, outlawed, imprisoned him for his love
of mankind.He has seen his dear friends sent to the guillotine, and
others are pining in British prisons for publishing his "Rights of
Man,"--principles pronounced by President Jefferson and Secretary
Madison to be those of the United States.Heartsore, scarred,
white-haired, there remains to this veteran of many struggles for
humanity but one hope, a kindly welcome, a peaceful haven for his
tempest-tossed life.Never for an instant has his faith in the heart
of America been shaken.Already he sees his friend Jefferson's arms
extended; he sees his old comrades welcoming him to their hearths; he
sees his own house and sward at Bordentown, and the beautiful Kirk-bride
mansion beside the Delaware,--river of sacred memories, soon to be
spanned by his graceful arch.How the ladies he left girls,--Fanny.Kitty, Sally,--will come with their husbands to greet him!How will they
admire the latest bridge-model, with Lady Smith's delicate chain-work
for which (such is his estimate of friendship) he refused three thousand
pounds, though it would have made his mean room palatial!Ah, yes, poor
heart, America will soothe your wounds, and pillow your sinking head on
her breast!America, with Jefferson in power, is herself again.They do
not hate men in America for not believing in a celestial Robespierre.Thou stricken friend of man, who hast appealed from the god of wrath
to the God of Humanity, see in the distance that Maryland coast, which
early voyagers called Avalon, and sing again your song when first
stepping on that shore twenty-seven years ago:

      "I come to sing that summer is at hand,
      The summer time of wit, you 'll understand;
      Plants, fruits, and flowers, and all the smiling race
      That can the orchard or the garden grace;
      The Rose and Lily shall address the fair,
      And whisper sweetly out, 'My dears, take care:'
      With sterling worth the Plant of Sense shall rise,
      And teach the curious to philosophize.We 'll garnish out the scenes
      With stately rows of Evergreens,
      Trees that will bear the frost, and deck their tops
      With everlasting flowers, like diamond drops."* "The Snowdrop and Critic," Pennsylvania Magazine, 1775.THE AMERICAN INQUISITION

On October 30th Paine landed at Baltimore.More than two and a half
centuries had elapsed since the Catholic Lord Baltimore appointed a
Protestant Governor of Maryland, William Stone, who proclaimed in that
province (1648) religious freedom and equality.The Puritans, crowding
thither, from regions of oppression, grew strong enough to exterminate
the religion of Lord Baltimore who had given them shelter, and
imprisoned his Protestant Governor.So, in the New World, passed the
Inquisition from Catholic to Protestant hands.In Paine's first American pamphlet, he had repeated and extolled the
principle of that earliest proclamation of religious liberty."Diversity
of religious opinions affords a larger field for Christian kindness."The Christian kindness now consists in a cessation of sectarian strife
that they may unite in stretching the author of the "Age of Reason"
on their common rack, so far as was possible under a Constitution
acknowledging no deity.Soon after landing Paine wrote to President Jefferson:

"I arrived here on Saturday from Havre, after a passage of sixty days.I have several cases of models, wheels, etc., and as soon as I can get
them from the vessel and put them on board the packet for Georgetown
I shall set off to pay my respects to you.Your much obliged
fellow-citizen,--Thomas Paine."On reaching Washington City Paine found his dear friend Monroe starting
off to resume his ministry in Paris, and by him wrote to Mr.Este,
banker in Paris (Sir Robert Smith's son-in-law), enclosing a letter to
Rickman, in London."You can have no idea," he tells Rickman, "of the
agitation which my arrival occasioned."Every paper is "filled with
applause or abuse.""My property in this country has been taken care of by my friends, and
is now worth six thousand pounds sterling; which put in the funds will
bring me L400 sterling a year.Remember me in friendship and affection
to your wife and family, and in the circle of our friends.I am but just
arrived here, and the minister sails in a few hours, so that I have just
time to write you this.If he should not sail this tide I will write to
my good friend Col.Bosville, but in any case I request you to wait on
him for me.* Paine still had faith in Bosville.He was slow in
     suspecting any man who seemed enthusiastic for liberty.In
     this connection it may be mentioned that it is painful to
     find in the "Diary and Letters of Gouverneur Morris," (ii.,
     p.426) a confidential letter to Robert R. Livingston,
     Minister in France, which seems to assume that Minister's
     readiness to receive slanders of Jefferson, who appointed
     him, and of Paine whose friendship he seemed to value.Speaking of the President, Morris says: "The employment of
     and confidence in adventurers from abroad will sooner or
     later rouse the pride and indignation of this country."Morris' editor adds: "This was probably an allusion to
     Thomas Paine, who had recently returned to America and was
     supposed to be an intimate friend of Mr.Jefferson, who, it
     was said, received him warmly, dined him at the White House,
     and could be seen walking arm in arm with him on the street
     any fine afternoon."The allusion to "adventurers" was no
     doubt meant for Paine, but not to his reception by
     Jefferson, for Morris' letter was written on August 27th,
     some two months before Paine's arrival.It was probably
     meant by Morris to damage Paine in Paris, where it was known
     that he was intimate with Livingston, who had been
     introduced by him to influential men, among others to Sir
     Robert Smith and Este, bankers.It is to be hoped that
     Livingston resented Morris' assumption of his treacherous
     character.Morris, who had shortly before dined at the White
     House, tells Livingston that Jefferson is "descending to a
     condition which I find no decent word to designate."Surely
     Livingston's descendants should discover his reply to that
     letter.The defeated Federalists had already prepared their batteries to assail
the President for inviting Paine to return on a national ship, under
escort of a Congressman.It required some skill for these adherents of
John Adams, a Unitarian, to set the Inquisition in motion.It had to be
done, however, as there was no chance of breaking down Jefferson but
by getting preachers to sink political differences and hound the
President's favorite author.Out of the North, stronghold of the
"British Party," came this partisan crusade under a pious flag.In
Virginia and the South the "Age of Reason" was fairly discussed, its
influence being so great that Patrick Henry, as we have seen, wrote and
burnt a reply.In Virginia, Deism, though largely prevailing, had not
prevented its adherents from supporting the Church as an institution.It had become their habit to talk of such matters only in private.Jefferson had not ventured to express his views in public, and was
troubled at finding himself mixed up with the heresies of Paine.*

     * To the Rev.Waterhouse (Unitarian) who had asked
     permission to publish a letter of his, Jefferson, with a
     keen remembrance of Paine's fate, wrote (July 19, 1822):
     "No, my dear Sir, not for the world.Into what a hornet's
     nest would it thrust my head!--The genus irritabile vatmm,
     on whom argument is lost, and reason is by themselves
     disdained in matters of religion.Don Quixote undertook to
     redress the bodily wrongs of the world, but the redressaient
     of mental vagaries would be an enterprise more than Quixotic
     I should as soon undertake to bring the crazy skulls of
     Bedlam to sound understanding as to inculcate reason into
     that of an Athanasian.I am old, and tranquillity is now my
     summum bonum.Keep me therefore from the fire and <DW19> of
     Calvin and his victim Servetus.Happy in the prospect of a
     restoration of a primitive Christianity, I must leave to
     younger athletes to lop off the false branches which have
     been engrafted into it by the mycologists of the middle and
     modern ages."--MS.The author on reaching Lovell's Hotel, Washington, had made known
his arrival to the President, and was cordially received; but as the
newspapers came in with their abuse, Jefferson may have been somewhat
intimidated.Eager to disembarrass the
administration, Paine published a letter in the _National Intelligencer_
which had cordially welcomed him, in which he said that he should not
ask or accept any office.*

     * The National Intelligencer (Nov.3d), announcing Paine's
     arrival at Baltimore, said, among other things: "Be his
     religious sentiments what they may, it must be their [the
     American people's] wish that he may live in the undisturbed
     possession of our common blessings, and enjoy them the more
     from his active participation in their attainment."The same
     paper said, Nov.10th: "Thomas Paine has arrived in this
     city [Washington] and has received a cordial reception from
     the Whigs of Seventy-six, and the republicans of 1800, who
     have the independence to feel and avow a sentiment of
     gratitude for his eminent revolutionary services."He meant to continue writing and bring forward his mechanical projects.None the less did the "federalist" press use Paine's infidelity to
belabor the President, and the author had to write defensive letters
from the moment of his arrival.On October 29th, before Paine had
landed, the _National Intelligencer_ had printed (from a Lancaster,
Pa., journal) a vigorous letter, signed "A Republican," showing that the
denunciations of Paine were not religious, but political, as John Adams
was also unorthodox.The "federalists" must often have wished that they
had taken this warning, for Paine's pen was keener than ever, and the
opposition had no writer to meet him.His eight "Letters to the
Citizens of the United States" were scathing, eloquent, untrammelled by
partisanship, and made a profound impression on the country,--for even
the opposition press had to publish them as part of the news of the
day.*

     * They were published in the National Intelligencer of
     November 15th, 22d.29th, December 6th, January 25th, and
     February 2d, 1803.Of the others one appeared in the Aurora
     (Philadelphia), dated from Bordentown, N. J., March 12th,
     and the last in the Trenton True American % dated April
     21st.On Christmas Day Paine wrote the President a suggestion for the purchase
of Louisiana.The French, to whom Louisiana had been ceded by Spain,
closed New Orleans (November 26th) against foreign ships (including
American), and prohibited deposits there by way of the Mississippi.This
caused much excitement, and the "federalists" showed eagerness to push
the administration into a belligerent attitude toward France.Paines
"common sense" again came to the front, and he sent Jefferson the
following paper:

"OF LOUISIANA."Spain has ceded Louisiana to france, and france has excluded the
Americans from N. Orleans and the navigation of the Mississippi;
the people of the Western Territory have complained of it to their
Government, and the governt.is of consequence involved and interested
in the affair The question then is--What is the best step to be taken?"The one is to begin by memorial and remonstrance against an infraction
of a right.The other is by accommodation, still keeping the right in
view, but not making it a groundwork."Suppose then the Government begin by making a proposal to france to
repurchase the cession, made to her by Spain, of Louisiana, provided it
be with the consent of the people of Louisiana or a majority thereof."By beginning on this ground any thing can be said without carrying the
appearance of a threat,--the growing power of the western territory
can be stated as matter of information, and also the impossibility
of restraining them from seizing upon New Orleans, and the equal
impossibility of france to prevent it."Suppose the proposal attended to, the sum to be given comes next on the
carpet This, on the part of America, will be estimated between the
value of the Commerce, and the quantity of revenue that Louisiana will
produce."The french treasury is not only empty, but the Government has consumed
by anticipation a great part of the next year's revenue.A monied
proposal will, I believe, be attended to; if it should, the claims upon
france can be stipulated as part of the payment, and that sum can be
paid here to the claimants.

"------I congratulate you on the _birthday of the New Sun_, now called
christmas-day; and I make you a present of a thought on Louisiana."Jefferson next day told Paine, what was as yet a profound secret, that
he was already contemplating the purchase of Louisiana.*

     * "The idea occurred to me," Paine afterwards wrote to the
     President, "without knowing it had occurred to any other
     person, and I mentioned it to Dr.Leib who lived in the same
     house (Lovell's); and, as he appeared pleased with it, I
     wrote the note and showed it to him before I sent it.The
     next morning you said to me that measures were already taken
     in that business.When Leib returned from Congress I told
     him of it.'Why then,' said I, 'did
     you not tell me so, because in that case I would not have
     sent the note.''That is the very reason,' said he; 'I would
     not tell you, because two opinions concurring on a case
     strengthen it.'Leib's motion
     about Banks.Congress ought to be very cautious how it gives
     encouragement to this speculating project of banking, for it
     is now carried to an extreme.It is but another kind of
     striking paper money.Neither do I like the notion
     respecting the recession of the territory [District of
     Columbia.]."Michael Leib was a representative from
     Pennsylvania.{1803}

The "New Sun" was destined to bring his sunstrokes on Paine.The
pathetic story of his wrongs in England, his martyrdom in France,
was not generally known, and, in reply to attacks, he had to tell
it himself.He had returned for repose and found himself a sort of
battlefield.One of the most humiliating circumstances was the discovery
that in this conflict of parties the merits of his religion were of
least consideration.The outcry of the country against him, so far as
it was not merely political, was the mere ignorant echo of pulpit
vituperation.His well-considered theism, fruit of so much thought,
nursed amid glooms of the dungeon, was called infidelity or atheism.Even some from whom he might have expected discriminating criticism
accepted the vulgar version and wrote him in deprecation of a work
they had not read.Samuel Adams, his old friend, caught in this
_schwarmerei_, wrote him from Boston (November 30th) that he had "heard"
that he had "turned his mind to a defence of infidelity."Paine copied
for him his creed from the "Age of Reason," and asked, "My good friend,
do you call believing in God infidelity?"This letter to Samuel Adams (January 1, 1803) has indications that Paine
had developed farther his theistic ideal."We cannot serve the Deity in the manner we serve those who cannot do
without that service.We can add nothing to
eternity.But it is in our power to render a service acceptable to him,
and that is, not by praying, but by endeavoring to make his creatures
happy.A man does not serve God by praying, for it is himself he is
trying to serve; and as to hiring or paying men to pray, as if the Deity
needed instruction, it is in my opinion an abomination.I have been
exposed to and preserved through many dangers, but instead of buffeting
the Deity with prayers, as if I distrusted him, or must dictate to him,
I reposed myself on his protection; and you, my friend, will find, even
in your last moments, more consolation in the silence of resignation
than in the murmuring wish of a prayer."Paine must have been especially hurt by a sentence in the letter of
Samuel Adams in which he said: "Our friend, the president of the United
States, has been calumniated for his liberal sentiments, by men who have
attributed that liberality to a latent design to promote the cause of
infidelity."To this he did not reply, but it probably led him to feel a
deeper disappointment at the postponement of the interviews he had hoped
to enjoy with Jefferson after thirteen years of separation.A feeling
of this kind no doubt prompted the following note (January 12th) sent to
the President:

"I will be obliged to you to send back the Models, as I am packing up
to set off for Philadelphia and New York.My intention in bringing them
here in preference to sending them from Baltimore to Philadelphia, was
to have some conversation with you on those matters and others I have
not informed you of.But you have not only shown no disposition towards
it, but have, in some measure, by a sort of shyness, as if you stood in
fear of federal observation, precluded it.I am not the only one, who
makes observations of this kind."Jefferson at once took care that there should be no misunderstanding
as to his regard for Paine.The author was for some days a guest in the
President's family, where he again met Maria Jefferson (Mrs.Eppes) whom
he had known in Paris.Randall says the devout ladies of the family had
been shy of Paine, as was but natural, on account of the President's
reputation for rationalism, but "Paine's discourse was weighty, his
manners sober and inoffensive; and he left Mr.Jefferson's mansion the
subject of lighter prejudices than he entered it."*

     * "Life of Jefferson," ii., 642 sec.Randall is mistaken in
     some statements.Paine, as we have seen, did not return on
     the ship placed at his service by the President; nor did
     the President's letter appear until long after his return,
     when he and Jefferson felt it necessary in order to disabuse
     the public mind of the most absurd rumors on the subject.Paine's defamers have manifested an eagerness to ascribe his
maltreatment to personal faults.For some years
after his arrival in the country no one ventured to hint anything
disparaging to his personal habits or sobriety.On January 1, 1803, he
wrote to Samuel Adams: "I have a good state of health and a happy mind;
I take care of both by nourishing the first with temperance, and the
latter with abundance."Had not this been true the "federal" press would have noised it abroad.In all portraits, French and American, his
dress is in accordance with the fashion.There was not, so far as I can
discover, a suggestion while he was at Washington, that he was not a
suitable guest for any drawing-room in the capital On February 23,
1803, probably, was written the following which I find among the Cobbett
papers:

From Mr.Jefferson, on the occasion of a toast being given
at a federal dinner at Washington, of "May they

     NEVER KNOW PLEASURE WHO LOVE PAINE.""I send you, Sir, a tale about some Feds,
     Who, in their wisdom, got to loggerheads.The case was this, they felt so flat and sunk,
     They took a glass together and got drunk.Such things, you know, are neither new nor rare,
     For some will hary themselves when in despair.It was the natal day of Washington,
     And that they thought a famous day for fun;
     For with the learned world it is agreed,
     The better day the better deed.They talked away, and as the glass went round
     They grew, in point of wisdom, more profound;
     For at the bottom of the bottle lies
     That kind of sense we overlook when wise.Come, here's a toast, cried one, with roar immense,
     May none know pleasure who love Common Sense.some others cried,
     But left it to the waiter to decide.I think, said he, the case would be more plain,
     To leave out Common Sense, and put in Paine.On this a mighty noise arose among
     This drunken, bawling, senseless throng.Some said that Common Sense was all a curse,
     That making people wiser made them worse;
     It learned them to be careful of their purse,
     And not be laid about like babes at nurse,
     Nor yet believe in stories upon trust,
     Which all mankind, to be well governed must;
     And that the toast was better at the first,
     And he that didn't think so might be cursed.So on they went, till such a fray arose
     As all who know what Feds are may suppose."On his way northward, to his old home in Bor-dentown, Paine passed many
a remembered spot, but found little or no greeting on his journey.In
Baltimore a "New Jerusalemite," as the Sweden-borgian was then called,
the Rev.Hargrove, accosted him with the information that the key to
scripture was found, after being lost 4,000 years."Then it must be very rusty," answered Paine."His principles," wrote
Rush to Cheetham, "avowed in his 'Age of Reason,' were so offensive to
me that I did not wish to renew my intercourse with him."Paine made
arrangements for the reception of his bridge models at Peale's Museum,
but if he met any old friend there no mention of it appears.Most
of those who had made up the old circle--Franklin, Rittenhouse,
Muhlenberg--were dead, some were away in Congress; but no doubt Paine
saw George Clymer.However, he did not stay long in Philadelphia, for he
was eager to reach the spot he always regarded as his home, Bordentown.And there, indeed, his hope, for a time, seemed to be fulfilled It need
hardly be said that his old friend Colonel Kirkbride gave him hearty
welcome.John Hall, Paine's bridge mechanician, "never saw him jollier,"
and he was full of mechanical "whims and schemes" they were to pursue
together.Jefferson was candidate for the presidency, and Paine entered
heartily into the canvass; which was not prudent, but he knew nothing of
prudence.The issue not only concerned an old friend, but was turning on
the question of peace with France.On March 12th he writes against the
"federalist" scheme for violently seizing New Orleans.At a meeting in
April, over which Colonel Kirkbride presides, Paine drafts a reply to an
attack on Jefferson's administration, circulated in New York.On April
21 st he writes the refutation of an attack on Jefferson, _apropos_ of
the national vessel offered for his return, which had been coupled
with a charge that Paine had proposed to the Directory an invasion of
America!In June he writes about his bridge models (then at Peale's
Museum, Philadelphia), and his hope to span the Delaware and the
Schuylkill with iron arches.Here is a letter written to Jefferson from Bordentown

(August 2d) containing suggestions concerning the beginning of
government in Louisiana, from which it would appear that Paine's faith
in the natural inspiration of _vox populi_ was still imperfect:

"I take it for granted that the present inhabitants know little or
nothing of election and representation as constituting government.They
are therefore not in an immediate condition to exercise those powers,
and besides this they are perhaps too much under the influence of their
priests to be sufficiently free."I should suppose that a Government _provisoire_ formed by Congress for
three, five, or seven years would be the best mode of beginning.In
the meantime they may be initiated into the practice by electing their
Municipal government, and after some experience they will be in train to
elect their State government.I think it would not only be good policy
but right to say, that the people shall have the right of electing their
Church Ministers, otherwise their Ministers will hold by authority from
the Pope.I do not make it a compulsive article, but to put it in their
power to use it when they please.It will serve to hold the priests in a
stile of good behavior, and also to give the people an idea of elective
rights.Anything, they say, will do to learn upon, and therefore they
may as well begin upon priests."The present prevailing language is french and Spanish, but it will be
necessary to establish schools to teach english as the laws ought to be
in the language of the Union."As soon as you have formed any plan for settling the Lands I shall be
glad to know it.My motive for this is because there are thousands and
tens of thousands in England and Ireland and also in Scotland who are
friends of mine by principle, and who would gladly change their present
country and condition.Many among them, for I have friends in all ranks
of life in those countries, are capable of becoming monied purchasers to
any amount."If you can give me any hints respecting Louisiana, the quantity in
square miles, the population, and amount of the present Revenue I will
find an opportunity of making some use of it.When the formalities of
the cession are compleated, the next thing will be to take possession,
and I think it would be very consistent for the President of the United
States to do this in person."What is Dayton gone to New Orleans for?Is he there as an Agent for the
British as Blount was said to be?"Of the same date is a letter to Senator Breck-enridge, of Kentucky,
forwarded through Jefferson:

"My Dear Friend,--Not knowing your place of Residence in Kentucky I send
this under cover to the President desiring him to fill up the direction."I see by the public papers and the Proclamation for calling Congress,
that the cession of Louisiana has been obtained.The papers state the
purchase to be 11,250,000 dollars in the six per cents and 3,750,000
dollars to be paid to American claimants who have furnished supplies to
France and the french Colonies and are yet unpaid, making on the whole
15,000,000 dollars."I observe that the faction of the Feds who last Winter were for going
to war to obtain possession of that country and who attached so much
importance to it that no expense or risk ought be spared to obtain it,
have now altered their tone and say it is not worth having, and that
we are better without it than with it."The second section of the 2d article of the constitution says, The
'President shall have Power by and with the consent of the senate to
make Treaties provided two thirds of the senators present concur.'"A question may be supposed to arise on the present case, which is,
under what character is the cession to be considered and taken up in
congress, whether as a treaty, or in some other shape?"Though the word, Treaty, as a Word, is unlimited in its meaning
and application, it must be supposed to have a denned meaning in the
constitution.It there means Treaties of alliance or of navigation and
commerce--Things which require a more profound deliberation than
common acts do, because they entail on the parties a future reciprocal
responsibility and become afterwards a supreme law on each of the
contracting countries which neither can annull.But the cession of
Louisiana to the United States has none of these features in it It is a
sale and purchase.A sole act which when finished, the parties have no
more to do with each other than other buyers and sellers have.It has no
future reciprocal consequences (which is one of the marked characters of
a Treaty) annexed to it; and the idea of its becoming a supreme law
to the parties reciprocally (which is another of the characters of a
Treaty) is inapplicable in the present case.There remains nothing for
such a law to act upon."I love the restriction in the constitution which takes from the
Executive the power of making treaties of his own will: and also the
clause which requires the consent of two thirds of the Senators, because
we cannot be too cautious in involving and entangling ourselves with
foreign powers; but I have an equal objection against extending the
same power to the senate in cases to which it is not strictly and
constitutionally applicable, because it is giving a nullifying power
to a minority.Treaties, as already observed, are to have future
consequences and whilst they remain, remain always in execution
externally as well as internally, and therefore it is better to run the
risk of losing a good treaty for the want of two thirds of the senate
than be exposed to the danger of ratifying a bad one by a small
majority.But in the present case no operation is to follow but what
acts itself within our own Territory and under our own laws.We are the
sole power concerned after the cession is accepted and the money paid,
and therefore the cession is not a Treaty in the constitutional meaning
of the word subject to be rejected by a minority in the senate."The question whether the cession shall be accepted and the bargain
closed by a grant of money for the purpose, (which I take to be the
sole question) is a case equally open to both houses of congress, and
if there is any distinction of _formal right_, it ought according to
the constitution, as a money transaction, to begin in the house of
Representatives."I suggest these matters that the senate may not be taken unawares, for
I think it not improbable that some Fed, who intends to negative the
cession, will move to take it up as if it were a Treaty of Alliance or
of Navigation and Commerce."The object here is an increase of territory for a valuable
consideration.It is altogether a home concern--a matter of domestic
policy.The only real ratification is the payment of the money, and as
all verbal ratification without this goes for nothing, it would be a
waste of time and expense to debate on the verbal ratification distinct
from the money ratification.The shortest way, as it appears to me,
would be to appoint a committee to bring in a report on the President's
Message, and for that committee to report a bill for the payment of the
money.The french Government, as the seller of the property, will not
consider anything ratification but the payment of the money contracted
for."There is also another point, necessary to be aware of, which is, to
accept it in toto.Any alteration or modification in it, or annexed as
a condition is so far fatal, that it puts it in the power of the other
party to reject the whole and propose new Terms.There can be no such
thing as ratifying in part, or with a condition annexed to it and
the ratification to be binding.It is still a continuance of the
negociation."It ought to be presumed that the American ministers have done to the
best of their power and procured the best possible terms, and that being
immediately on the spot with the other party they were better Judges of
the whole, and of what could, or could not be done, than any person at
this distance, and unacquainted with many of the circumstances of the
case, can possibly be."If a treaty, a contract, or a cession be good upon the whole, it is ill
policy to hazard the whole, by an experiment to get some trifle in it
altered.The right way of proceeding in such case is to make sure of
the whole by ratifying it, and then instruct the minister to propose
a clause to be added to the Instrument to obtain the amendment or
alteration wished for.This was the method Congress took with respect to
the Treaty of Commerce with France in 1778.Congress ratified the whole
and proposed two new articles which were agreed to by France and added
to the Treaty."There is according to newspaper account an article which admits french
and Spanish vessels on the same terms as American vessels.But this
does not make it a commercial Treaty.It is only one of the Items in the
payment: and it has this advantage, that it joins Spain with France in
making the cession and is an encouragement to commerce and new settlers."With respect to the purchase, admitting it to be 15 millions dollars,
it is an advantageous purchase.The revenue alone purchased as an
annuity or rent roll is worth more--at present I suppose the revenue
will pay five per cent for the purchase money."I know not if these observations will be of any use to you.I am in
a retired village and out of the way of hearing the talk of the great
world.But I see that the Feds, at least some of them, are changing
their tone and now reprobating the acquisition of Louisiana; and the
only way they can take to lose the affair will be to take it up as they
would a Treaty of Commerce and annull it by a Minority; or entangle it
with some condition that will render the ratification of no effect."I believe in this state (Jersey) we shall have a majority at the next
election.I have half a
disposition to visit the Western World next spring and go on to New
Orleans.They are a new people and unacquainted with the principles of
representative government and I think I could do some good among them."As the stage-boat which was to take this letter to the Post-office does
not depart till to-morrow, I amuse myself with continuing the subject
after I had intended to close it."I know little and can learn but little of the extent and present
population of Louisiana.After the cession be com-pleated and the
territory annexed to the United States it will, I suppose, be formed
into states, one, at least, to begin with."The people, as I have said, are new to us and we to them and a great
deal will depend on a right beginning.As they have been transferred
backward and forward several times from one European Government to
another it is natural to conclude they have no fixed prejudices with
respect to foreign attachments, and this puts them in a fit disposition
for their new condition.The established religion is roman; but in
what state it is as to exterior ceremonies (such as processions and
celebrations), I know not.Had the cession to france continued with her,
religion I suppose would have been put on the same footing as it is
in that country, and there no ceremonial of religion can appear on the
streets or highways; and the same regulation is particularly necessary
now or there will soon be quarrels and tumults between the old settlers
and the new.The Yankees will not move out of the road for a little
wooden Jesus stuck on a stick and carried in procession nor kneel in
the dirt to a wooden Virgin Mary.As we do not govern the territory as
provinces but incorporated as states, religion there must be on the same
footing it is here, and Catholics have the same rights as Catholics have
with us and no others.As to political condition the Idea proper to be
held out is, that we have neither conquered them, nor bought them, but
formed a Union with them and they become in consequence of that union a
part of the national sovereignty."The present Inhabitants and their descendants will be a majority for
some time, but new emigrations from the old states and from Europe, and
intermarriages, will soon change the first face of things, and it is
necessary to have this in mind when the first measures shall be taken.Everything done as an expedient grows worse every day, for in proportion
as the mind grows up to the full standard of sight it disclaims the
expedient.America had nearly been ruined by expedients in the first
stages of the revolution, and perhaps would have been so, had not
'Common Sense' broken the charm and the Declaration of Independence sent
it into banishment."Yours in friendship

"Thomas Paine.*

"remember me in the circle of your friends."William F.
     Havermeyer, Jr.E. M. Woodward, in his account of Bordentown, mentions among the
"traditions" of the place, that Paine used to meet a large number of
gentlemen at the "Washington House," kept by Debora Applegate, where he
conversed freely "with any proper person who approached him."Paine was too much occupied in literary pursuits and writing to
spend a great deal of his time here, but he generally paid several
visits during the day.In walking he
was generally absorbed in deep thought, seldom noticed any one as he
passed, unless spoken to, and in going from his home to the tavern was
frequently observed to cross the street several times.It is stated that
several members of the church were turned from their faith by him, and
on this account, and the general feeling of the community against him
for his opinions on religious subjects, he was by the mass of the
people held in odium, which feeling to some extent was extended to Col.These "traditions" were recorded in 1876.Paine's "great power of
conversation" was remembered.But among the traditions, even of the
religious, there is none of any excess in drinking.Possibly the turning of several church-members from their faith may
not have been so much due to Paine as to the parsons, in showing their
"religion" as a gorgon turning hearts to stone against a benefactor
of mankind.One day Paine went with Colonel Kirkbride to visit Samuel
Rogers, the Colonels brother-in-law, at Bellevue, across the river.As
he entered the door Rogers turned his back, refusing his old friend's
hand, because it had written the "Age of Reason."Presently Borden-town
was placarded with pictures of the Devil flying away with Paine.The
pulpits set up a chorus of vituperation.Why should the victim spare the
altar on which he is sacrificed, and justice also?Dogma had chosen to
grapple with the old man in its own way.That it was able to break a
driven leaf Paine could admit as truly as Job; but he could as bravely
say: Withdraw thy hand from me, and I will answer thee, or thou shalt
answer me!In Paine too it will be proved that such outrages on truth
and friendship, on the rights of thought, proceed from no God, but from
the destructive forces once personified as the adversary of man.Early in March Paine visited New York, to see Monroe before his
departure for France.He drove with Kirkbride to Trenton; but so furious
was the pious mob, he was refused a seat in the Trenton stage.They
dined at Government House, but when starting for Brunswick were hooted
These were the people for whose liberties Paine had marched that same
road on foot, musket in hand.At Trenton insults were heaped on the
man who by camp-fires had written the _Crisis_, which animated the
conquerors of the Hessians at that place, in "the times that tried men's
souls."These people he helped to make free,--free to cry _Crucify!_

Paine had just written to Jefferson that the Louisianians were "perhaps
too much under the influence of their priests to be sufficiently free."Probably the same thought occurred to him about people nearer home,
when he presently heard of Colonel Kirkbride's sudden unpopularity, and
death.On October 3d Paine lost this faithful friend.*

     * It should be stated that Burlington County, in which
     Bordentown is situated, was preponderantly Federalist, and
     that Trenton was in the hands of a Federalist mob of young
     well-to-do rowdies.The editor of the _True American_, a
     Republican paper to which Paine had contributed, having
     commented on a Fourth of July orgie of those rowdies in a
     house associated with the revolution, was set upon with
     bludgeons on July 12th, and suffered serious injuries.The
     Grand Jury refused to present the Federalist ruffians,
     though the evidence was clear, and the mob had free course.The facts of the Paine mob are these: after dining at Government House,
Trenton, Kirkbride applied for a seat on the New York stage for Paine.The owner, Voorhis, cursed Paine as "a deist," and said, "I 'll be
damned if he shall go in my stage."Another stage-owner also refused,
saying, "My stage and horses were once struck by lightning, and I don't
want them to suffer again."When Paine and Kirkbride had entered their
carriage a mob surrounded them with a drum, playing the "rogue's march."The local reporter (_True American_) says, "Mr.Paine discovered not the
least emotion of fear or anger, but calmly observed that such conduct
had no tendency to hurt his feelings or injure his fame."The mob then
tried to frighten the horse with the drum, and succeeded, but the two
gentlemen reached a friend's house in Brunswick in safety.A letter
from Trenton had been written to the stage-master there also, to prevent
Paine from securing a seat, whether with success does not appear.NEW ROCHELLE AND THE BONNEVILLES

The Bonnevilles, with whom Paine had resided in Paris, were completely
impoverished after his departure.They resolved to follow Paine to
America, depending on his promise of aid should they do so.Foreseeing
perils in France, Nicolas, unable himself to leave at once, hurried off
his wife and children--Benjamin, Thomas, and Louis.Madame Bonneville
would appear to have arrived in August, 1803.I infer this because Paine
writes, September 23d, to Jefferson from Stonington, Connecticut; and
later letters show that he had been in New York, and afterwards placed
Thomas Paine Bonneville with the Rev.Foster (Universalist) of
Stonington for education.Madame Bonneville was placed in his house at
Bordentown, where she was to teach French.At New York, Paine found both religious and political parties sharply
divided over him.At Lovett's Hotel, where he stopped, a large dinner
was given him, March 18th, seventy being present One of the active
promoters of this dinner was James Cheetham, editor of the _American
Citizen_, who, after seriously injuring Paine by his patronage, became
his malignant enemy.In the summer of 1803 the political atmosphere was in a tempestuous
condition, owing to the widespread accusation that Aaron Burr had
intrigued with the Federalists against Jefferson to gain the presidency.There was a Society in New York called "Republican Greens," who, on
Independence Day, had for a toast "Thomas Paine, the Man of the People,"
and who seem to have had a piece of music called the "Rights of Man."Paine was also apparently the hero of that day at White Plains, where
a vast crowd assembled, "over 1,000," among the toasts being: "Thomas
Paine--the bold advocate of rational liberty--the People's friend."He
probably reached New York again in August A letter for "Thomas Payne"
is in the advertised Letter-list of August 6th, and in the _American
Citizen_ (August 9th) are printed (and misprinted) "Lines, extempore, by
Thomas Paine, July, 1803."*

     * On July 12th the _Evening Post _(edited by William
     Coleman) tries to unite republicanism and infidelity by
     stating that Part I. of the "Age of Reason" was sent in MS.Fellows of New York, and in the following year Part
     II.was gratuitously distributed "from what is now the
     office of the Aurora."On September 24th that paper
     publishes a poem about Paine, ending:


     "Quick as the lightning's vivid flash
     The poet's eye o'er Europe rolls;
     Sees battles rage, hears tempests crash,
     And dims at horror's threatening scowls."Mark ambition's ruthless king,
     With crimsoned banners scathe the globe;
     While trailing after conquest's wing,
     Man's festering wounds his demons probe."Palled with streams of reeking gore
     That stain the proud imperial day,
     He turns to view the western shore,
     Where freedom holds her boundless sway."'T is here her sage triumphant sways
     An empire in the people's love;
     'T is here the sovereign will obeys
     No king but Him who rules above."The verses, crudely expressing the contrast between President Jefferson
and King George--or Napoleon, it is not clear which,--sufficiently show
that Paine's genius was not extempore.His reputation as a patriotic
minstrel was high; his "Hail, great Republic," to the tune of "Rule
Britannia," was the established Fourth-of-July song, and it was even
sung at the dinner of the American consul in London (Erving) March 4,
1803, the anniversary of Jefferson's election.Possibly the extempore
lines were sung on some Fourth-of-July occasion.I find "Thomas Paine"
and the "Rights of Man" favorite toasts at republican celebrations in
Virginia also at this time.In New York we may discover Paine's coming
and going by rancorous paragraphs concerning him in the _Evening Post_.*

     "And having spent a lengthy life in evil,
     Return again unto thy parent Devil!"Perhaps the most malignant wrong done Paine in this paper was the
adoption of his signature, "Common Sense," by one of its contributors!Another paragraph says that Franklin hired Paine in London to come to
America and write in favor of the Revolution,--a remarkable example of
federalist heredity from "Toryism."On September 27th the paper prints a
letter purporting to have been found by a waiter in Lovett's Hotel after
Paine's departure,--a long letter to Paine, by some red-revolutionary
friend, of course gloating over the exquisite horrors filling Europe in
consequence of the "Rights of Man."12, 1803," and signed "J.The paper's correspondent pretends
to have found out Oldney, and conversed with him.No doubt many simple
people believed the whole thing genuine.The most learned physician in New York, Dr.Nicholas Romayne, invited
Paine to dinner, where he was met by John Pintard, and other eminent
citizens.Pintard said to Paine: "I have read and re-read your 'Age
of Reason,' and any doubts which I before entertained of the truth
of revelation have been removed by your logic.Yes, sir, your very
arguments against Christianity have convinced me of its truth.""Well
then," answered Paine, "I may return to my couch to-night with the
consolation that I have made at least one Christian."* This authentic
anecdote is significant John Pintard, thus outdone by Paine in
politeness, founded the Tammany Society, and organized the democratic
party.When the "Rights of Man" appeared, the book and its author were
the main toasts of the Tammany celebrations; but it was not so after
the "Age of Reason" had appeared.For John Pintard was all his life
a devotee of Dutch Reformed orthodoxy.Tammany, having begun with the
populace, had by this time got up somewhat in society.As a rule the
"gentry" were Federalists, though they kept a mob in their back yard to
fly at the democrats on occasion.But with Jefferson in the presidential
chair, and Clinton vice-president, Tammany was in power.To hold this
power Tammany had to court the clergy.So there was no toast to Paine in
the Wigwam of 1803.Francis' "Old New York," p.** The New York Daily Advertiser published the whole of Part
     I. of the "Rights of Man" in 1791 (May 6-27), the editor
     being then John Pintard.At the end of the publication a
     poetical tribute to Paine was printed.Four of the lines run:

     "Rous'd by the reason of his manly page,
     Once more shall Paine a listening world engage;
     From reason's source a bold reform he brings,
     By raising up mankind he pulls down kings."President Jefferson was very anxious about the constitutional points
involved in his purchase of Louisiana, and solicited Paine's views on
the whole subject.Paine wrote to him extended communications, among
which was the letter of September 23d, from Stonington.The interest of
the subject is now hardly sufficient to warrant publication of the whole
of this letter, which, however, possesses much interest.At the great celebration (October 12, 1792) of the third Centenary of
the discovery of America, by the sons of St Tammany, New York, the first
man toasted after Columbus was Paine, and next to Paine "The Rights of
Man."They were also extolled in an ode composed for the occasion, and
sung."Your two favours of the 10 and 18 ult.reached me at this place on the
14th inst.I do not suppose that the framers
of the Constitution thought anything about the acquisition of new
territory, and even if they did it was prudent to say nothing about
it, as it might have suggested to foreign Nations the idea that we
contemplated foreign conquest.It appears to me to be one of those cases
with which the Constitution had nothing to do, and which can be judged
of only by the circumstances of the times when such a case shall occur.The Constitution could not foresee that Spain would cede Louisiana to
France or to England, and therefore it could not determine what our
conduct should be in consequence of such an event.The cession makes
no alteration in the Constitution; it only extends the principles of it
over a larger territory, and this certainly is within the morality of
the Constitution, and not contrary to, nor beyond, the expression or
intention of any of its articles... Were a question to arise it would
apply, not to the Cession, because it violates no article of the
Constitution, but to Ross and Morris's motion.The Constitution empowers
Congress to declare war, but to make war without declaring it is
anti-constitutional.It is like attacking an unarmed man in the dark.There is also another reason why no such question should arise.The
english Government is but in a tottering condition and if Bonaparte
succeeds, that Government will break up.In that case it is not
improbable we may obtain Canada, and I think that Bermuda ought to
belong to the United States.In its present condition it is a nest for
piratical privateers.This is not a subject to be spoken of, but it may
be proper to have it in mind."The latest news we have from Europe in this place is the insurrection
in Dublin.It is a disheartening circumstance to the english Government,
as they are now putting arms into the hands of people who but a few
weeks before they would have hung had they found a pike in their
possession.I think the probability is in favour of the descent [on
England by Bonaparte]...

"I shall be employed the ensuing Winter in cutting two or three thousand
Cords of Wood on my farm at New Rochelle for the New York market distant
twenty miles by water.The Wood is worth 3 1/2 dollars per load as it
stands.This will furnish me with ready money, and I shall then be ready
for whatever may present itself of most importance next spring.I had
intended to build myself a house to my own taste, and a workshop for
my mechanical operations, and make a collection, as authors say, of
my works, which with what I have in manuscript will make four, or five
octavo volumes, and publish them by subscription, but the prospects that
are now opening with respect to England hold me in suspence."It has been customary in a President's discourse to say something about
religion.The word, religion,
used as a word _en masse_ has no application to a country like America.In catholic countries it would mean exclusively the religion of the
romish church; with the Jews, the Jewish religion; in England,
the protestant religion or in the sense of the english church, the
established religion; with the Deists it would mean Deism; with the
Turks, Mahometism &c, &c, As well as I recollect it is _Lego, Religo,
Relegio, Religion_, that is say, tied or bound by an oath or obligation.The french use the word properly; when a woman enters a convent, she is
called a novitiate; when she takes the oath, she is a _religieuse_, that
is, she is bound by an oath.Now all that we have to do, as a Government
with the word religion, in this country, is with the civil rights of it,
and not at all with its _creeds_.Instead therefore of using the word
religion, as a word en masse, as if it meant a creed, it would be better
to speak only of its civil rights; _that all denominations of religion
are equally protected, that none are dominant, none inferior, that
the rights of conscience are equal to every denomination and to every
individual and that it is the duty of Government to preserve this
equality of conscientious rights_.A man cannot be called a hypocrite
for defending the civil rights of religion, but he may be suspected of
insincerity in defending its creeds."I suppose you will find it proper to take notice of the impressment of
American seamen by the Captains of British vessels, and procure a list
of such captains and report them to their government.This pretence
of searching for british seamen is a new pretence for visiting and
searching American vessels....

"I am passing some time at this place at the house of a friend till the
wood cutting time comes on, and I shall engage some cutters here and
then return to New Rochelle.Madison concerning the
report that the british Government had cautioned ours not to pay
the purchase money for Louisiana, as they intended to take it for
themselves.I have received his [negative] answer, and I pray you make
him my compliments."We are still afflicted with the yellow fever, and the Doctors are
disputing whether it is an imported or a domestic disease.Would it not
be a good measure to prohibit the arrival of all vessels from the West
Indies from the last of June to the middle of October.If this was
done this session of Congress, and we escaped the fever next summer, we
should always know how to escape it.I question if performing quarantine
is a sufficient guard.The disease may be in the cargo, especially that
part which is barrelled up, and not in the persons on board, and when
that cargo is opened on our wharfs, the hot steaming air in contact with
the ground imbibes the infection.I can conceive that infected air can
be barrelled up, not in a hogshead of rum, nor perhaps sucre, but in
a barrel of coffee.I am badly off in this place for pen and Ink, and
short of paper.I heard yesterday from Boston that our old friend S.
Adams was at the point of death.When Madame Bonneville left France it was understood that her husband
would soon follow, but he did not come, nor was any letter received from
him.This was probably the most important allusion in a letter of Paine,
dated New York, March 1, 1804, to "Citizen Skipwith, Agent Commercial
d'Amerique, Paris.""Dear Friend--I have just a moment to write you a line by a friend who
is on the point of sailing for Bordeaux.The Republican interest is now
compleatly triumphant.The change within this last year has been great.We have now 14 States out of 17,--N. Hampshire, Mass.I much question if any person will be started against Mr.Burr is rejected for the vice-presidency; he is now putting
up for Governor of N. York.Morgan Lewis, Chief Justice of the State of N. Y. is the Republican
candidate for Governor of that State."I have not received a line from Paris, except a letter from Este, since
I left it.We have now been nearly 80 days without news from Europe.I have not heard anything from him except that
he is _always_ coming.Not a line has been
received from aim.Madame Bonneville, unable to speak English, found Bordentown dull,
and soon turned up in New York.She ordered rooms in Wilburn's
boarding-house, where Paine was lodging, and the author found the
situation rather complicated The family was absolutely without means
of their own, and Paine, who had given them a comfortable home at
Bordentown, was annoyed by their coming on to New York.Anxiety is shown
in the following letter written at 16 Gold St., New York, March 24th, to
"Mr."Dear Sir,--I received your letter by Mr.Nixon, and also a former
letter, but I have been so unwell this winter with a fit of gout, tho'
not so bad as I had at Bordenton about twenty years ago, that I could
not write, and after I got better I got a fall on the ice in the garden
where I lodge that threw me back for above a month.I was obliged to get
a person to copy off the letter to the people of England, published
in the Aurora, March 7, as I dictated it verbally, for all the time my
complaint continued.My health and spirits were as good as ever.It
was my intention to have cut a large quantity of wood for the New York
market, and in that case you would have had the money directly, but this
accident and the gout prevented my doing anything.I shall now have to
take up some money upon it, which I shall do by the first of May to put
Mrs.Bonneville into business, and I shall then discharge her bill.In
the mean time I wish you to receive a quarter's rent due on the 1st of
April from Mrs Richardson, at $25 per ann., and to call on Mrs.Read for
40 or 50 dollars, or what you can get, and to give a receipt in my name.Kirkbride should have discharged your bill, it was what he engaged
to do.Wharton owes for the rent of the house while she lived in
it, unless Col.Kirkbride has taken it into his accounts.Samuel Hileyar
owes me 84 dollars lent him in hard money.Nixon spake to me about
hiring my house, but as I did not know if Mrs.Richardson intended to
stay in it or quit it I could give no positive answer, but said I would
write to you about it.Israel Butler also writes me about taking at the
same rent as Richardson pays.I will be obliged to you to let the house
as you may judge best.I shall make a visit to Bordenton in the spring,
and I shall call at your house first."There have been several arrivals here in short passages from England.P. Porcupine, I see, is become the panegyrist of Bonaparte.You will see
it in the Aurora of March 19, and also the message of Bonaparte to the
french legislature.She would have wrote, but she
cannot yet venture to write in English.I congratulate you on your new
appointment."*

     * I am indebted for this letter to the N. Y. Hist.Society,
     which owns the original ought to be fulfilled."The
     following passages may be quoted:

     "In casting my eye over England and America, and comparing
     them together, the difference is very striking.The two
     countries were created by the same power, and peopled from
     the same stock.Have
     those who emigrated to America improved, or those whom they
     left behind degenerated?...We see America flourishing
     in peace, cultivating friendship with all nations, and
     reducing her public debt and taxes, incurred by the
     revolution.On the contrary we see England almost
     perpetually in war, or warlike disputes, and her debt and
     taxes continually increasing.Could we suppose a stranger,
     who knew nothing of the origin of the two nations, he would
     from observation conclude that America was the old country,
     experienced and sage, and England the new, eccentric and
     wild.Scarcely had England drawn home her troops from
     America, after the revolutionary war, than she was on the
     point of plunging herself into a war with Holland, on
     account of the Stadtholder; then with Russia; then with
     Spain on account of the Nootka cat-skins; and actually with
     France to prevent her revolution.Scarcely had she made
     peace with France, and before she had fulfilled her own part
     of the Treaty, than she declared war again, to avoid
     fulfilling the Treaty.In her Treaty of peace with America,
     she engaged to evacuate the western posts within six months;
     but, having obtained peace, she refused to fulfil the
     conditions, and kept possession of the posts, and embroiled
     herself in an Indian war.* In her Treaty of peace with
     France, she engaged to evacuate Malta within three months;
     but, having obtained peace, she refused to evacuate Malta,
     and began a new war."* Paine's case is not quite sound at this point.The
     Americans had not, on their side, fulfilled the condition of
     paying their English debts.(1804)

Paine's letter alluded to was printed in the _Aurora_ with the following
note:

"To the Editor.--As the good sense of the people in their elections has
now put the affairs of America in a prosperous condition at home and
abroad, there is nothing immediately important for the subject of a
letter.I therefore send you a piece on another subject."The piece presently appeared as a pamphlet of sixteen pages with the
following title: "Thomas Paine to the People of England, on the Invasion
of England.Philadelphia: Printed at the Temple of Reason Press, Arch
Street.Once more the hope had risen in Paine's breast that
Napoleon was to turn liberator, and that England was to be set free."If
the invasion succeed I hope Bonaparte will remember that this war
has not been provoked by the people.It is altogether the act of the
government without their consent or knowledge; and though the late
peace appears to have been insidious from the first, on the part of the
government, it was received by the people with a sincerity of joy."He still hopes that the English people may be able to end the trouble
peacefully, by compelling Parliament to fulfil the Treaty of Amiens.Paine points out that the failure of the French Revolution was due to
"the provocative interference of foreign powers, of which Pitt was
the principal and vindictive agent," and affirms the success of
representative government in the United States after thirty years'
trial."The people of England have now two revolutions before them,--the
one as an example, the other as a warning.Their own wisdom will direct
them what to choose and what to avoid; and in everything which regards
their happiness, combined with the common good of mankind, I wish them
honor and success."During this summer, Paine wrote a brilliant paper on a memorial sent
to Congress from the French inhabitants of Louisiana.They demanded
immediate admission to equal Statehood, also the right to continue
the importation of <DW64> slaves.Paine reminds the memorialists of
the "mischief caused in France by the possession of power before they
understood principles."After explaining their position, and the
freedom they have acquired by the merits of others, he points out their
ignorance of human "rights" as shown in their guilty notion that to
enslave others is among them."Dare you put up a petition to Heaven
for such a power, without fearing to be struck from the earth by its
justice?Why, then, do you ask it of man against man?Do you want to
renew in Louisiana the horrors of Domingo?"This article (dated September 22d) produced great effect.John Randolph
of Roanoke, in a letter to Albert Gallatin (October 14th), advises
"the printing of... thousand copies of Tom Paine's answer to their
remonstrance, and transmitting them by as many thousand troops, who
can speak a language perfectly intelligible to the people of Louisiana,
whatever that of their governor may be."Nicolas Bonneville still giving no sign, and Madame being uneconomical
in her notions of money, Paine thought it necessary--morally and
financially--to let it be known that he was not responsible for her
debts.When, therefore, Wilburn applied to him for her board ($35),
Paine declined to pay, and was sued.Paine pleaded _non assumpsit_, and,
after gaining the case, paid Wilburn the money.It presently turned out that the surveillance of Nicolas Bonneville did
not permit him to leave France, and, as he was not permitted to resume
his journal or publications, he could neither join his family nor assist
them.Paine now resolved to reside on his farm.It is dated at New Rochelle, July 9th:

"Fellow Citizen,--As the weather is now getting hot at New York, and the
people begin to get out of town, you may as well come up here and help
me settle my accounts with the man who lives on the place.You will be
able to do this better than I shall, and in the mean time I can go on
with my literary works, without having my mind taken off by affairs of
a different kind.I have received a packet from Governor Clinton,
enclosing what I wrote for.If you come up by the stage you will stop
at the post-office, and they will direct you the way to the farm.I send a price for the Prospect; if the plan
mentioned in it is pursued, it will open a way to enlarge and give
establishment to the deistical church; but of this and some other things
we will talk when you come up, and the sooner the better.Paine was presently enjoying himself on his farm at New Rochelle, and
Madame Bonneville began to keep house for him."It is a pleasant and healthy situation [he wrote to Jefferson somewhat
later], commanding a prospect always green and peaceable, as New
Rochelle produces a great deal of grass and hay.The farm contains three
hundred acres, about one hundred of which is meadow land, one hundred
grazing and village land, and the remainder woodland.It is an oblong
about a mile and a half in length.I have sold off sixty-one acres and
a half for four thousand and twenty dollars.With this money I shall
improve the other part, and build an addition 34 feet by 32 to the
present dwelling."He goes on into an architectural description, with drawings, of
the arched roof he intends to build, the present form of roof being
"unpleasing to the eye."He also draws an oak floor such as they make in
Paris, which he means to imitate.With a black cook, Rachel Gidney, the family seemed to be getting on
with fair comfort; but on Christmas Eve an event occurred which came
near bringing Paine's plans to an abrupt conclusion.This is related
in a letter to William Carver, New York, dated January 16th, at New
Rochelle."Esteemed Friend,--I have recd, two letters from you, one giving an
account of your taking Thomas to Mr.Foster*--the other dated Jany.12--I did not answer the first because I hoped to see you the next
Saturday or the Saturday after.* Thomas Bonneville, Paine's godson, at school in Stonington.What you heard of a gun being fired into the room is true--Robert and
Rachel were both gone out to keep Christmas Eve and about eight o'clock
at Night the gun were fired.Dean's
boys with me, but the person that had done it was gone.I directly
suspected who it was, and I halloed to him by name, that _he was
discovered_.I did this that the party who fired might know I was on the
watch.I cannot find any ball, but whatever the gun was charged with
passed through about three or four inches below the window making a hole
large enough to a finger to go through--the muzzle must have been very
near as the place is black with the powder, and the glass of the window
is shattered to pieces.Mr Shute after examining the place and getting
what information could be had, issued a warrant to take up Derrick, and
after examination committed him."He is now on bail (five hundred dollars) to take his trial at the
supreme Court in May next.Derrick owes me forty-eight dollars for which
I have his note, and he was to work it out in making stone fence which
he has not even begun and besides this I have had to pay forty-two
pounds eleven shillings for which I had passed my word for him at Mr.Derrick borrowed the Gun under pretence of giving Mrs.He was with Purdy about two hours before the
attack on the house was made and he came from thence to Dean's half
drunk and brought with him a bottle of Rum, and Purdy was with him when
he was taken up."I am exceedingly well in health and shall always be glad to see you.Hubbs tells me that your horse is getting better.Shute sent for
the horse and took him when the first snow came but he leaped the fences
and came back.If this be the case I
suppose he has broke or cracked it in leaping a fence when he was lame
on the other hind leg, and hung with his hind legs in the fence.I am
glad to hear what you tell me of Thomas.He shall not want for anything
that is necessary if he be a good boy for he has no friend but me.You
have not given me any account about the meeting house.The window of the room said to have been Paine's study is close to the
ground, and it is marvellous that he was not murdered.**

     * I am indebted for this letter to Dr.Clair J. Grece, of
     England, whose uncle, Daniel Constable, probably got it from
     Carver.** Derrick (or Dederick) appears by the records at White
     Plains to have been brought up for trial May 19, 1806, and
     to have been recognized in the sum of $500 for his
     appearance at the next Court of Oyer and Terminer and
     General Gaol Delivery, and in the meantime to keep the peace
     towards the

People, and especially towards Thomas Payne (sic).Paine, Christopher
Hubbs, and Andrew A. Dean were recognized in $50 to appear and give
evidence against Derrick.Nothing further appears in the records
(examined for me by Mr.B. D. Washburn up to 1810).It is pretty certain
that Paine did not press the charges.The most momentous change which had come over America during Paine's
absence was the pro-slavery reaction.This had set in with the first
Congress.An effort was made by the Virginia representatives to check
the slave traffic by imposing a duty of $10 on each <DW64> imported, but
was defeated by an alliance of members from more Southern States and
professedly antislavery men of the North.The Southern leader in this
first victory of slavery in Congress was Major Jackson of Georgia, who
defended the institution as scriptural and civilizing.Franklin published (Federal Gazette, March 25, 1790) a parody of
Jackson's speech, purporting to be a speech uttered in 1687 by a Divan
of Algiers in defence of piracy and slavery, against a sect of Erika,
or Purists, who had petitioned for their suppression.Franklin was now
president of the American Antislavery Society, founded in Philadelphia
in 1775 five weeks after the appearance of Paine's scheme of
emancipation (March 8, 1775).Rush was also active in the cause, and
to him Paine wrote (March 16, 1790) the letter on the subject elsewhere
quoted (L, p.This letter was published by Rush (Columbian
Magazine, vol.318) while the country was still agitated by the
debate which was going on in Congress at the time when it was written,
on a petition of the Antislavery Society, signed by Franklin,--his
last public act.Franklin died April 17, 1790, twenty-five days after the close of the
debate, in which he was bitterly denounced by the proslavery party.Washington had pronounced the petition "inopportune,"--his presidential
mansion in New York was a few steps from the slave-market,--Jefferson
(now Secretary of State) had no word to say for it, Madison had smoothed
over the matter by a compromise.Thenceforth slavery had become a
suppressed subject, and the slave trade, whenever broached in Congress,
had maintained its immunity.In 1803, even under Jefferson's
administration, the <DW64>s fleeing from oppression in Domingo were
forbidden asylum in America, because it was feared that they would
incite servile insurrections.That the United States, under presidency
of Jefferson, should stand aloof from the struggle of the <DW64>s in
Domingo for liberty, cut Paine to the heart.Unperturbed by the attempt
made on his own life a few days before, he wrote to Jefferson on New
Year's Day, 1805, (from New Rochelle,) what may be regarded as an
appeal:




{1805}

"Dear Sir,--I have some thoughts of coming to Washington this winter, as
I may as well spend a part of it there as elsewhere.But lest bad roads
or any other circumstance should prevent me I suggest a thought for
your consideration, and I shall be glad if in this case, as in that of
Louisiana, we may happen to think alike without knowing what each other
had thought of."The affair of Domingo will cause some trouble in either of the cases
in which it now stands.If armed merchantmen force their way through the
blockading fleet it will embarrass us with the french Government;
and, on the other hand, if the people of Domingo think that we show a
partiality to the french injurious to them there is danger they will
turn Pirates upon us, and become more injurious on account of vicinity
than the barbary powers, and England will encourage it, as she
encourages the Indians.Domingo is lost to France either as to the
Government or the possession of it, But if a way could be found out to
bring about a peace between france and Domingo through the mediation,
and under the guarantee of the United States, it would be beneficial to
all parties, and give us a great commercial and political standing,
not only with the present people of Domingo but with the West Indies
generally.And when we have gained their confidence by acts of
justice and friendship, they will listen to our advice in matters of
Civilization and Government, and prevent the danger of their becoming
pirates, which I think they will be, if driven to desperation."The United States is the only power that can undertake a measure of
this kind.She is now the Parent of the Western world, and her knowledge
of the local circumstances of it gives her an advantage in a matter of
this kind superior to any European Nation.She is enabled by situation,
and grow[ing] importance to become a guarantee, and to see, as far as
her advice and influence can operate, that the conditions on the part
of Domingo be fulfilled.It is also a measure that accords with
the humanity of her principles, with her policy, and her commercial
interest."All that Domingo wants of France, is, that France agree to let her
alone, and withdraw her forces by sea and land; and in return for
this Domingo to give her a monopoly of her commerce for a term of
years,--that is, to import from France all the utensils and manufactures
she may have occasion to use or consume (except such as she can more
conveniently procure from the manufactories of the United States), and
to pay for them in produce.France will gain more by this than she can
expect to do even by a conquest of the Island, and the advantage to
America will be that she will become the carrier of both, at least
during the present war."There was considerable dislike in Paris against the Expedition to
Domingo; and the events that have since taken place were then often
predicted.The opinion that generally prevailed at that time was that
the commerce of the Island was better than the conquest of it,--that the
conquest could not be accomplished without destroying the <DW64>s, and
in that case the Island would be of no value."I think it might be signified to the french Government, yourself is
the best judge of the means, that the United States are disposed to
undertake an accommodation so as to put an end to this otherwise endless
slaughter on both sides, and to procure to France the best advantages in
point of commerce that the state of things will admit of.Such an offer,
whether accepted or not, cannot but be well received, and may lead to a
good end."There is now a fine snow, and if it continues I intend to set off
for Philadelphia in about eight days, and from thence to Washington.I congratulate your constituents on the success of the election for
President and Vice-President."Yours in friendship,

"Thomas Paine."The journey to Washington was given up, and Paine had to content himself
with his pen.He took in several newspapers, and was as keenly alive
as ever to the movements of the world.His chief anxiety was lest some
concession might be made to the Louisianians about the slave trade, that
region being an emporium of the traffic which grew more enterprising and
brutal as its term was at hand.Much was said of the great need of the
newly acquired region for more laborers, and it was known that Jefferson
was by no means so severe in his opposition to slavery as he was once
supposed to be.The President repeatedly invited Paine's views, and they
were given fully and freely.The following extracts are from a letter
dated New York, January 25, 1805:

"Mr.Wingate called on me at N. York, where I
happened to be when they arrived on their Journey from Washington to
the Eastward: I find by Mr.Lincoln that the Louisiana Memorialists will
have to return as they came and the more decisively Congress put an
end to this business the better.The Cession of Louisiana is a great
acquisition; but great as it is it would be an incumbrance on the Union
were the prayer of the petitioners to be granted, nor would the lauds be
worth settling if the settlers are to be under a french jurisdiction....
When the emigrations from the United States into Louisiana become equal
to the number of french inhabitants it may then be proper and right to
erect such part where such equality exists into a constitutional state;
but to do it now would be sending the american settlers into exile....
For my own part, I wish the name of Louisiana to be lost, and this may
in a great measure be done by giving names to the new states that will
serve as descriptive of their situation or condition.France lost the
names and almost the remembrance of provinces by dividing them into
departments with appropriate names."Next to the acquisition of the territory and the Government of it
is that of settling it.The people of the Eastern States are the
best settlers of a new country, and of people from abroad the German
Peasantry are the best.The Irish in general are generous and dissolute.The Scotch turn their attention to traffic, and the English to
manufactures.These people are more fitted to live in cities than to
be cultivators of new lands.I know not if in Virginia they are much
acquainted with the importation of German redemptioners, that is,
servants indented for a term of years.The best farmers in Pennsylvania
are those who came over in this manner or the descendants of them.The
price before the war used to be twenty pounds Pennsylvania currency for
an indented servant for four years, that is, the ship owner, got twenty
pounds per head passage money, so that upon two hundred persons he would
receive after their arrival four thousand pounds paid by the persons who
purchased the time of their indentures which was generally four
years.These would be the best people, of foreigners, to bring into
Louisiana--because they would grow to be citizens.Whereas bringing poor
<DW64>s to work the lands in a state of slavery and wretchedness, is,
besides the immorality of it, the certain way of preventing population
and consequently of preventing revenue.I question if the revenue
arising from ten <DW64>s in the consumption of imported articles is
equal to that of one white citizen.In the articles of dress and of the
table it is almost impossible to make a comparison."These matters though they do not belong to the class of principles are
proper subjects for the consideration of Government; and it is always
fortunate when the interests of Government and that of humanity act
unitedly.But I much doubt if the Germans would come to be under a
french Jurisdiction.Congress must frame the laws under which they are
to serve out their time; after which Congress might give them a few
acres of land to begin with for themselves and they would soon be able
to buy more.I am inclined to believe that by adopting this method the
Country will be more peopled in about twenty years from the present time
than it has been in all the times of the french and Spaniards.Spain,
I believe, held it chiefly as a barrier to her dominions in Mexico, and
the less it was improved the better it agreed with that policy; and
as to france she never shewed any great disposition or gave any great
encouragement to colonizing.It is chiefly small countries, that are
straitened for room at home, like Holland and England, that go in quest
of foreign settlements....

"I have again seen and talked with the gentleman from Hamburg.He tells
me that some Vessels under pretence of shipping persons to America
carried them to England to serve as soldiers and sailors.He tells me
he has the Edict or Proclamation of the Senate of Hamburg forbidding
persons shipping themselves without the consent of the Senate, and that
he will give me a copy of it, which if he does soon enough I will send
with this letter.He says that the American Consul has been spoken to
respecting this kidnapping business under American pretences, but
that he says he has no authority to interfere.The German members of
Congress, or the Philadelphia merchants or ship-owners who have been
in the practice of importing German redemptioners, can give you better
information respecting the business of importation than I can.But the
redemptioners thus imported must be at the charge of the Captain or
ship owner till their time is sold.Some of the quaker Merchants of
Philadelphia went a great deal into the importation of German servants
or redemptioners.It agreed with the morality of their principles that
of bettering people's condition, and to put an end to the practice of
importing slaves.I think it not an unreasonable estimation to suppose
that the population of Louisiana may be increased ten thousand souls
every year.What <DW44>s the settlement of it is the want of labourers,
and until labourers can be had the sale of the lands will be slow.Were
I twenty years younger, and my name and reputation as well known in
European countries as it is now, I would contract for a quantity of land
in Louisiana and go to Europe and bring over settlers....

"It is probable that towards the close of the session I may make an
excursion to Washington.The piece on Gouverneur Morris's Oration
on Hamilton and that on the Louisiana Memorial are the last I have
published; and as every thing of public affairs is now on a good ground
I shall do as I did after the War, remain a quiet spectator and attend
now to my own affairs."I intend making a collection of all the pieces I have published,
beginning with Common Sense, and of what I have by me in manuscript,
and publish them by subscription.I have deferred doing this till the
presidential election should be over, but I believe there was not much
occasion for that caution.There is more hypocrisy than bigotry in
America.When I was in Connecticut the summer before last, I fell
in company with some Baptists among whom were three Ministers.The
conversation turned on the election for President, and one of them who
appeared to be a leading man said 'They cry out against Mr.Jefferson
because, they say he is a Deist.Well, a Deist may be a good man, and if
he think it right, it is right to him.For my own part, said he, 'I had
rather vote for a Deist than for a blue-skin presbyterian.''You judge
right,' said I, 'for a man that is not of any of the sectaries will hold
the balance even between all; but give power to a bigot of any sectary
and he will use it to the oppression of the rest, as the blue-skins
do in connection,' They all agree in this sentiment, and I have always
found it assented to in any company I have had occasion to use it."I judge the collection I speak of will make five volumes octavo of four
hundred pages each at two dollars a volume to be paid on delivery; and
as they will be delivered separately, as fast as they can be printed and
bound the subscribers may stop when they please.The three first volumes
will be political and each piece will be accompanied with an account
of the state of affairs at the time it was written, whether in America,
france, or England, which will also shew the occasion of writing it.of the Crisis published the 19th
December '76 is '_These are the times that try men's souls,_' It is
therefore necessary as explanatory to the expression in all future times
to shew what those times were.The two last volumes will be theological
and those who do not chuse to take them may let them alone.They will
have the right to do so, by the conditions of the subscription.I shall
also make a miscellaneous Volume of correspondence, Essays, and
some pieces of Poetry, which I believe will have some claim to
originality....

"I find by the Captain [from New Orleans] above mentioned that several
Liverpool ships have been at New Orleans.It is chiefly the people
of Liverpool that employ themselves in the slave trade and they bring
cargoes of those unfortunate <DW64>s to take back in return the hard
money and the produce of the country.Had I the command of the elements
I would blast Liverpool with fire and brimstone.It is the Sodom and
Gomorrah of brutality....

"I recollect when in France that you spoke of a plan of making the
<DW64>s tenants on a plantation, that is, allotting each Negroe family
a quantity of land for which they were to pay to the owner a certain
quantity of produce.I think that numbers of our free <DW64>s might be
provided for in this manner in Louisiana.The best way that occurs to me
is for Congress to give them their passage to New Orleans, then for them
to hire themselves out to the planters for one or two years; they would
by this means learn plantation business, after which to place them on a
tract of land as before mentioned.A great many good things may now be
done; and I please myself with the idea of suggesting my thoughts to
you."Old Captain Landais who lives at Brooklyn on Long Island opposite
New York calls sometimes to see me.He is a very
respectable old man.I wish something had been done for him in Congress
on his petition; for I think something is due to him, nor do I see how
the Statute of limitation can consistently apply to him.The law in John
Adams's administration, which cut off all commerce and communication
with france, cut him off from the chance of coming to America to put
in his claim.I suppose that the claims of some of our merchants on
England, france and Spain is more than 6 or 7 years standing yet no
law of limitation, that I know of take place between nations or between
individuals of different nations.I consider a statute of limitation to
be a domestic law, and can only have a domestic operation.Miller,
one of the New York Senators in Congress, knows Landais and can give you
an account of him."Concerning my former letter, on Domingo, I intended had I come to
Washington to have talked with Pichon about it--if you had approved that
method, for it can only be brought forward in an indirect way.The two
Emperors are at too great a distance in objects and in colour to have
any intercourse but by Fire and Sword, yet something I think might be
done.It is time I should close this long epistle.Paine made but a brief stay in New York (where he boarded with William
Carver).His next letter (April 22d) is from New Rochelle, written to
John Fellows, an auctioneer in New York City, one of his most faithful
friends."Citizen: I send this by the N. Rochelle boat and have desired the
boatman to call on you with it.He is to bring up Bebia and Thomas and I
will be obliged to you to see them safe on board.The boat will leave N.
Y. on friday."I have left my pen knife at Carver's.It is, I believe, in the writing
desk.It is a small french pen knife that slides into the handle.I wish
Carver would look behind the chest in the bed room.I miss some papers
that I suppose are fallen down there.The boys will bring up with them
one pair of the blankets Mrs.Bonneville took down and also my best
blanket which is at Carver's.--I send enclosed three dollars for a ream
of writing paper and one dollar for some letter paper, and porterage to
the boat.I wish you to give the boys some good advice when you go with
them, and tell them that the better they behave the better it will be
for them.I am now their only dependance, and they ought to know it.of the Prospect, while I was at Carver's, are left there.since I came to New
Rochelle."'The Thomas mentioned in this letter was Paine's godson, and "Bebia" was
Benjamin,--the late Brigadier-General Bonneville, U. S. A. The third
son, Louis, had been sent to his father in France.The _Prospect_ was
Elihu Palmer's rationalistic paper.Early in this year a series of charges affecting Jefferson's public and
private character were published by one Hulbert, on the authority of
Thomas Turner of Virginia.Beginning with an old charge of cowardice,
while Governor (of which Jefferson had been acquitted by the Legislature
of Virginia), the accusation proceeded to instances of immorality,
persons and places being named.The following letter from New Rochelle,
July 19th, to John Fellows enclosed Paine's reply, which appeared in the
_American Citizen_, July 23d and 24th:

     * This letter is in the possession of Mr.Grenville Kane,
     Tuxedo, N. Y."Citizen--I inclose you two pieces for Cheetham's paper, which I wish
you to give to him yourself.in one daily paper,
and the other number in the next daily paper, and then both in his
country paper.There has been a great deal of anonimous (sic) abuse
thrown out in the federal papers against Mr.Jefferson, but until some
names could be got hold of it was fighting the air to take any notice
of them.We have now got hold of two names, your townsman Hulbert, the
hypocritical Infidel of Sheffield, and Thomas Turner of Virginia, his
correspondent.I have already given Hulbert a basting with my name
to it, because he made use of my name in his speech in the Mass.Turner has not given me the same cause in the letter he
wrote (and evidently) to Hulbert, and which Hulbert, (for it could be
no other person) has published in the Repertory to vindicate himself.Jefferson, and I have taken
them up one by one, which is the first time the opportunity has offered
for doing it; for before this it was promiscuous abuse.I have not
signed it either with my name or signature (Common Sense) because I
found myself obliged, in order to made such scoundrels feel a little
smart, to go somewhat out of my usual manner of writing, but there are
some sentiments and some expressions that will be supposed to be in my
stile, and I have no objection to that supposition, but I do not wish
Mr.Jefferson to be _obliged_ to know it is from me."Since receiving your letter, which contained no direct information of
any thing I wrote to you about, I have written myself to Mr.Barrett
accompanied with a piece for the editor of the Baltimore Evening Post,
who is an acquaintance of his, but I have received no answer from Mr.B., neither has the piece been published in the Evening Post.I will be
obliged to you to call on him & to inform me about it.You did not
tell me if you called upon Foster; but at any rate do not delay the
enclosed.--I do not trouble you with any messages or compliments, for
you never deliver any.* I am indebted for this letter to Mr.editor of the National Reformer,  London.By a minute comparison of the two alleged specifications of immorality,
Paine proved that one was intrinsically absurd, and the other without
trustworthy testimony.As for the charge of cowardice, Paine contended
that it was the duty of a civil magistrate to move out of danger, as
Congress had done in the Revolution.The article was signed "A Spark
from the Altar of '76," but the writer was easily recognized.The
service thus done Jefferson was greater than can now be easily realized.Another paper by Paine was on "Constitutions, Governments and
Charters."It was an argument to prove the unconstitutionality in New
York of the power assumed by the legislature to grant charters.This
defeated the object of annual elections, by placing the act of one
legislature beyond the reach of its successor.He proposes that all
matters of "extraordinary legislation," such as those involving grants
of land and incorporations of companies, "shall be passed only by a
legislature succeeding the one in which it was proposed."Had such an
article been originally in the Constitution [of New York] the bribery
and corruption employed to seduce and manage the members of the late
legislature, in the affair of the Merchants' Bank, could not have taken
place.It would not have been worth while to bribe men to do what they
had no power of doing.Madame Bonneville hated country life, and insisted on going to New
York.Paine was not sorry to have her leave, as she could not yet talk
English, and did not appreciate Paine's idea of plain living and high
thinking.She apparently had a notion that Paine had a mint of money,
and, like so many others, might have attributed to parsimony efforts
the unpaid author was making to save enough to give her children,
practically fatherless, some start in life.The philosophic solitude in
which he was left at New Rochelle is described in a letter (July 31st)
to John Fellows, in New York.Bonneville go into some family as
a teacher, for she has not the least talent of managing affairs for
herself.I will take care of him for his
own sake and his father's, but that is all I have to say.... I am
master of an empty house, or nearly so.I have six chairs and a table, a
straw-bed, a featherbed, and a bag of straw for Thomas, a tea kettle, an
iron pot, an iron baking pan, a frying pan, a gridiron, cups, saucers,
plates and dishes, knives and forks, two candlesticks and a pair of
snuffers.I have a pair of fine oxen and an ox-cart, a good horse, a
Chair, and a one-horse cart; a cow, and a sow and 9 pigs.When you come
you must take such fare as you meet with, for I live upon tea, milk,
fruit-pies, plain dumplins, and a piece of meat when I get it; but I
live with that retirement and quiet that suit me.Bonneville was
an encumbrance upon me all the while she was here, for she would not do
anything, not even make an apple dumplin for her own children.If you
cannot make yourself up a straw bed, I can let you have blankets, and
you will have no occasion to go over to the tavern to sleep."As I do not see any federal papers, except by accident, I know not if
they have attempted any remarks or criticisms on my Eighth Letter, [or]
the piece on Constitutional Governments and Charters, the two numbers
on Turner's letter, and also the piece on Hulbert.As to anonymous
paragraphs, it is not worth noticing them.I consider the generality of
such editors only as a part of their press, and let them pass.--I want
to come to Morrisania, and it is probable I may come on to N. Y., but I
wish you to answer this letter first.--Yours in friendship."* I am indebted for an exact copy of the letter from which
     this is extracted to-Dr.Garnett of the British Museum,
     though it is not in that institution.It must not be supposed from what Paine says of Madame Bonneville that
there was anything acrimonious in their relations.She was thirty-one
years younger than Paine, fond of the world, handsome.The old
gentleman, all day occupied with writing, could give her little
companionship, even if he could have conversed in French, But he
indulged her in every way, gave her more money than he could afford,
devoted his ever decreasing means to her family.She had boundless
reverence for him, but, as we have seen, had no taste for country life.Probably, too, after Dederick's attempt on Paine's life she became
nervous in the lonely house.So she had gone to New York, where she
presently found good occupation as a teacher of French in several
families.Her sons, however, were fond of New Rochelle, and of Paine,
who had a knack of amusing children, and never failed to win their
affection.*

     * In the Tarrytown Argus, October 18, 1890, appeared an
     interesting notice of the Rev.Alexander Davis (Methodist),
     by C. K. B[uchanan] in which it is stated that Davis, a
     native of New Rochelle, remembered the affection of Paine,
     who "would bring him round-hearts and hold him on his knee."Many such recollections of his little neighbors have been
     reported.The spring of 1805 at New Rochelle was a pleasant one for Paine.He wrote his last political pamphlet, which was printed by Duane,
Philadelphia, with the title: "Thomas Paine to the Citizens of
Pennsylvania, on the Proposal for Calling a Convention."It opens with a
reference to his former life and work in Philadelphia."Removed as I
now am from the place, and detached from everything of personal party, I
address this token to you on the ground of principle, and in remembrance
of former times and friendships."He gives an historical account of the
negative or veto-power, finding it the English Parliament's badge of
disgrace under William of Normandy, a defence of personal prerogative
that ought to find no place in a republic.He advises that in the new
Constitution the principle of arbitration, outside of courts, should
be established.The governor should possess no power of patronage; he
should make one in a Council of Appointments.The Senate is an imitation
of the House of Lords.The Representatives should be divided by lot into
two equal parts, sitting in different chambers.One half, by not
being entangled in the debate of the other on the issue submitted, nor
committed by voting, would become silently possessed of the arguments,
and be in a calm position to review the whole.The votes of the two
houses should be added together, and the majority decide.Judges should
be removable by some constitutional mode, without the formality of
impeachment at "stated periods."(In 1807 Paine wrote to Senator
Mitchell of New York suggesting an amendment to the Constitution of the
United States by which judges of the Supreme Court might be removed by
the President for reasonable cause, though insufficient for impeachment,
on the address of a majority of both Houses of Congress.)In this pamphlet was included the paper already mentioned (on Charters,
etc.The two essays prove that
there was no abatement in Paine's intellect, and that despite occasional
"flings" at the "Feds,"--retorts on their perpetual naggings,--he was
still occupied with the principles of political philosophy.At this time Paine had put the two young Bon-nevilles at a school in
New Rochelle, where they also boarded.He had too much solitude in the
house, and too little nourishment for so much work.So the house was let
and he was taken in as a boarder by Mrs.Bayeaux, in the old Bayeaux
House, which is still standing,*--but Paine's pecuniary situation now
gave him anxiety.He was earning nothing, his means were found to be
far less than he supposed, the needs of the Bonnevilles increasing.Considering the important defensive articles he had written for the
President, and their long friendship, he ventured (September 30th) to
allude to his situation and to remind him that his State, Virginia,
had once proposed to give him a tract of land, but had not done so.He
suggests that Congress should remember his services.Bayeaux is mentioned in Paine's letter about
     Dederick's attempt on his life."But I wish you to be assured that whatever event this proposal may take
it will make no alteration in my principles or my conduct I have been
a volunteer to the world for thirty years without taking profits from
anything I have published in America or Europe.I have relinquished all
profits that those publications might come cheap among the people for
whom they were intended--Yours in friendship."This was followed by another note (November 14th) asking if it had been
received.What answer came from the President does not appear.About this time Paine published an essay on "The cause of the Yellow
Fever, and the means of preventing it in places not yet infected with
it Addressed to the Board of Health in America."The treatise, which he
dates June 27th, is noticed by Dr.Paine points out
that the epidemic which almost annually afflicted New York, had been
unknown to the Indians; that it began around the wharves, and did not
reach the higher parts of the city.He does not believe the disease
certainly imported from the West Indies, since it is not carried from
New York to other places.He thinks that similar filthy conditions of
the wharves and the water about them generate the miasma alike in the
West Indies and in New York.It would probably be escaped if the wharves
were built on stone or iron arches, permitting the tides to cleanse the
shore and carry away the accumulations of vegetable and animal matter
decaying around every ship and dock.He particularly proposes the use of
arches for wharves about to be constructed at Corlder's Hook and on the
North River.Francis justly remarks, in his "Old New York," that Paine's writings
were usually suggested by some occasion.Besides this instance of the
essay on the yellow fever, he mentions one on the origin of Freemasonry,
there being an agitation in New York concerning that fraternity.But this essay---in which Paine, with ingenuity and learning, traces
Freemasonry to the ancient solar mythology also identified with
Christian mythology--was not published during his life.It was published
by Madame Bonneville with the passages affecting Christianity omitted.The original manuscript was obtained, however, and published with an
extended preface, criticizing Paine's theory, the preface being in
turn criticized by Paine's editor.The preface was probably written by
Colonel Fellows, author of a large work on Freemasonry.A NEW YORK PROMETHEUS

When Paine left Bordentown, on March 1st 1803, driving past placards of
the devil flying away with him, and hooted by a pious mob at Trenton,
it was with hope of a happy reunion with old friends in more enlightened
New York.Few, formerly senator from Georgia, his friend of many
years, married Paine's correspondent, Kitty Nicholson, to whom was
written the beautiful letter from London (L, p.Few had
become a leading man in New York, and his home, and that of the
Nicholsons, were of highest social distinction.Paine's arrival at
Lovett's Hotel was well known, but not one of those former friends came
near him."They were actively as well as passively religious," says
Henry Adams, "and their relations with Paine after his return to America
in 1802 were those of compassion only, for his intemperate and offensive
habits, and intimacy was impossible.Adams will vainly search
his materials for any intimation at that time of the intemperate or
offensive habits.Gallatin continued to risk
     Paine.360

The "compassion" is due to those devotees of an idol requiring sacrifice
of friendship, loyalty, and intelligence.The
old author was as a grand organ from which a cunning hand might bring
music to be remembered through the generations.In that brain were
stored memories of the great Americans, Frenchmen, Englishmen who acted
in the revolutionary dramas, and of whom he loved to talk.What would a
diary of interviews with Paine, written by his friend Kitty Few, be now
worth?To intolerance, the least pardonable form of ignorance, must be
credited the failure of those former friends, who supposed themselves
educated, to make more of Thomas Paine than a scarred monument of an Age
of Unreason.But the ostracism of Paine by the society which, as Henry Adams states,
had once courted him "as the greatest literary genius of his day,"
was not due merely to his religious views, which were those of various
statesmen who had incurred no such odium.There was at work a lingering
dislike and distrust of the common people.From the scholastic study, where heresies once
written only in Latin were daintily wrapped up in metaphysics, from
drawing-rooms where cynical smiles went round at Methodism, and other
forms of "Christianity in earnest," Paine carried heresy to the people.And he brought it as a religion,--as fire from the fervid heaven
that orthodoxy had monopolized.The popularity of his writing, the
revivalistic earnestness of his protest against dogmas common to all
sects, were revolutionary; and while the vulgar bigots were binding him
on their rock of ages, and tearing his vitals, most of the educated, the
social leaders, were too prudent to manifest any sympathy they may have
felt.**

     * When Paine first reached New York, 1803, he was (March
     5th) entertained at supper by John Crauford.For being
     present Eliakira Ford, a Baptist elder, was furiously
     denounced, as were others of the company.** An exception was the leading Presbyterian, John Mason,
     who lived to denounce Channing as "the devil's disciple."Grant Thorbura was psalm-singer in this Scotch preacher's
     church.Curiosity to see the lion led Thorburn to visit
     Paine, for which he was "suspended."Thorburn afterwards
     made amends by fathering Cheetham's slanders of Paine after
     Cheetham had become too infamous to quote.It were unjust to suppose that Paine met with nothing but abuse and
maltreatment from ministers of serious orthodoxy in New York.They had
warmly opposed his views, even denounced them, but the controversy seems
to have died away until he took part in the deistic propaganda of Elihu
Palmer.'Fellows (July 31st) shows Paine much
interested in the "cause":

"I am glad that Palmer and Foster have got together.I enclose a letter I received a few days since from
Groton, in Connecticut The letter is well written, and with a good deal
of sincere enthusiasm.The publication of it would do good, but there is
an impropriety in publishing a man's name to a private letter.You
may show the letter to Palmer and Foster.... Remember me to my much
respected friend Carver and tell him I am sure we shall succeed if we
hold on.We have already silenced the clamor of the priests.They act
now as if they would say, let us alone and we will let you alone.You do
not tell me if the Prospect goes on.As Carver will want pay he may have
it from me, and pay when it suits him; but I expect he will take a ride
up some Saturday, and then he can chuse for himself."The result of this was that Paine passed the winter in New York,
where he threw himself warmly into the theistic movement, and no doubt
occasionally spoke from Elihu Palmer's platform.The rationalists who gathered around Elihu Palmer in New York were
called the "Columbian Illuminati."The pompous epithet looks like an
effort to connect them with the Columbian Order (Tammany) which was
supposed to represent Jacobinism and French ideas generally.Their
numbers were considerable, but they did not belong to fashionable
society.Their lecturer, Elihu Palmer, was a scholarly gentleman of the
highest character.A native of Canterbury, Connecticut, (born 1754) he
had graduated at Dartmouth.Watt to
a widow, Mary Powell, in New York (1803), at the time when he was
lecturing in the Temple of Reason (Snow's Rooms, Broadway).This
suggests that he had not broken with the clergy altogether.Somewhat
later he lectured at the Union Hotel, William Street He had studied
divinity, and turned against the creeds what was taught him for their
support."I have more than once [says Dr.Francis] listened to Palmer; none could
be weary within the sound of his voice; his diction was classical; and
much of his natural theology attractive by variety of illustration.But admiration of him sank into despondency at his assumption, and his
sarcastic assaults on things most holy.His boldest phillippic was his
discourse on the title-page of the Bible, in which, with the double
shield of jacobinism and infidelity, he warned rising America against
confidence in a book authorised by the monarchy of England.Palmer
delivered his sermons in the Union Hotel in William Street."Francis does not appear to have known Paine personally, but had seen
him.Palmer's chief friends in New York were, he says, John Fellows;
Rose, an unfortunate lawyer; Taylor, a philanthropist; and Charles
Christian.John Foster, another rationalist lecturer, Dr.Francis says he had a noble presence and great eloquence.Foster's
exordium was an invocation to the goddess of Liberty.John Fellows, always the devoted friend of Paine, was an
auctioneer, but in later life was a constable in the city courts.He
has left three volumes which show considerable literary ability, and
industrious research; but these were unfortunately bestowed on such
extinct subjects as Freemasonry, the secret of Junius, and controversies
concerning General Putnam.It is much to be regretted that Colonel
Fellows should not have left a volume concerning Paine, with whom he was
in especial intimacy, during his last years.Other friends of Paine were Thomas Addis Emmet, Walter Morton, a lawyer,
and Judge Hertell, a man of wealth, and a distinguished member of the
State Assembly.Fulton also was much in New York, and often called on
Paine.Paine was induced to board at the house of William Carver (36
Cedar Street), which proved a grievous mistake.Carver had introduced
himself to Paine, saying that he remembered him when he was an exciseman
at Lewes, England, he (Carver) being a young farrier there.He made loud
professions of deism, and of devotion to Paine.The farrier of Lewes
had become a veterinary practitioner and shopkeeper in New York.Paine supposed that he would be cared for in the house of this active
rationalist, but the man and his family were illiterate and vulgar.His sojourn at Carver's probably shortened Paine's life.Carver, to
anticipate the narrative a little, turned out to be a bad-hearted man
and a traitor.Paine had accumulated a mass of fragmentary writings on religious
subjects, and had begun publishing them in a journal started in 1804
by Elihu Palmer,--_The Prospect; or View of the Moral World_.This
succeeded the paper called _The Temple of Reason_.One of Paine's
objects was to help the new journal, which attracted a good deal of
attention.His first communication (February 18, 1804), was on a sermon
by Robert Hall, on "Modern Infidelity," sent him by a gentleman in New
York.The following are some of its trenchant paragraphs:

"Is it a fact that Jesus Christ died for the sins of the world, and
how is it proved?If a God he could not die, and as a man he could not
redeem: how then is this redemption proved to be fact?It is said that
Adam eat of the forbidden fruit, commonly called an apple, and thereby
subjected himself and all his posterity forever to eternal damnation.This is worse than visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children
unto the third and fourth generations.But how was the death of Jesus
Christ to affect or alter the case?If so,
would it not have been better to have crucified Adam upon the forbidden
tree, and made a new man?""Why do not the Christians, to be consistent, make Saints of Judas and
Pontius Pilate, for they were the persons who accomplished the act of
salvation.The merit of a sacrifice, if there can be any merit in it,
was never in the thing sacrificed, but in the persons offering up the
sacrifice--and therefore Judas and Pilate ought to stand first in the
calendar of Saints."Other contributions to the _Prospect_ were: "Of the word Religion";
"Cain and Abel"; "The Tower of Babel"; "Of the religion of Deism
compared with the Christian Religion"; "Of the Sabbath Day in
Connecticut"; "Of the Old and New Testaments"; "Hints towards forming a
Society for inquiring into the truth or falsehood of ancient history,
so far as history is connected with systems of religion ancient and
modern"; "To the members of the Society styling itself the Missionary
Society"; "On Deism, and the writings of Thomas Paine"; "Of the Books
of the New Testament" There were several communications without any
heading.Passages and sentences from these little essays have long been
a familiar currency among freethinkers."We admire the wisdom of the ancients, yet they had no bibles, nor
books, called revelation.They cultivated the reason that God gave them,
studied him in his works, and rose to eminence.""The Cain and Abel of Genesis appear to be no other than the ancient
Egyptian story of Typhon and Osiris, the darkness and the light, which
answered very well as allegory without being believed as fact.""Those who most believe the Bible are those who know least about it.""Another observation upon the story of Babel is the inconsistence of it
with respect to the opinion that the bible is the word of God given for
the information of mankind; for nothing could so effectually prevent
such a word being known by mankind as confounding their language.""God has not given us reason for the purpose of confounding us.""Jesus never speaks of Adam, of the Garden of Eden, nor of what is
called the fall of man.""Is not the Bible warfare the same kind of warfare as the Indians
themselves carry on?"[On the presentation of a Bible to some Osage
chiefs in New York.]"The remark of the Emperor Julian is worth observing.'If, said he,
'there ever had been or could be a Tree of Knowledge, instead of God
forbidding man to eat thereof, it would be that of which he would order
him to eat the most.'""Do Christians not see that their own religion is founded on a human
sacrifice?Many thousands of human sacrifices have since been offered on
the altar of the Christian Religion.""For several centuries past the dispute has been about doctrines."The Bible has been received by Protestants on the authority of the
Church of Rome.""The same degree of hearsay evidence, and that at third and fourth hand,
would not, in a court of justice, give a man title to a cottage, and
yet the priests of this profession presumptuously promise their deluded
followers the kingdom of Heaven.""Nobody fears for the safety of a mountain, but a hillock of sand may
be washed away.Blow then, O ye priests, 'the Trumpet in Zion,' for the
Hillock is in danger."The force of Paine's negations was not broken by any weakness for
speculations of his own.He constructed no system to invite the missiles
of antagonists.It is, indeed, impossible to deny without affirming;
denial that two and two make five affirms that they make four.The basis
of Paine's denials being the divine wisdom and benevolence, there was in
his use of such expressions an implication of limitation in the divine
nature.Wisdom implies the necessity of dealing with difficulties, and
benevolence the effort to make all sentient creatures happy.Neither
quality is predicable of an omniscient and omnipotent being, for whom
there could be no difficulties or evils to overcome.confuse the world with his doubts or with his mere opinions.He stuck to
his certainties, that the scriptural deity was not the true one, nor
the dogmas called Christian reasonable.But he felt some of the moral
difficulties surrounding theism, and these were indicated in his reply
to the Bishop of Llandaff."The Book of Job belongs either to the ancient Persians, the Chaldeans,
or the Egyptians; because the structure of it is consistent with the
dogma they held, that of a good and evil spirit, called in Job God
and Satan, existing as distinct and separate beings, and it is not
consistent with any dogma of the Jews.... The God of the Jews was the
God of everything.According to Exodus
it was God, and not the Devil, that hardened Pharaoh's heart.According
to the Book of Samuel it was an evil spirit from God that troubled
Saul.And Ezekiel makes God say, in speaking of the Jews, 'I gave them
statutes that were not good, and judgments by which they should not
live.'...As to the precepts, principles, and maxims in the Book of Job,
they show that the people abusively called the heathen, in the books
of the Jews, had the most sublime ideas of the Creator, and the most
exalted devotional morality.It was
the Gentiles who glorified him."Several passages in Paine's works show that he did not believe in a
personal devil; just what he did believe was no doubt written in a part
of his reply to the Bishop, which, unfortunately, he did not live to
carry through the press.In the part that we have he expresses
the opinion that the Serpent of Genesis is an allegory of winter,
necessitating the "coats of skins" to keep Adam and Eve warm, and adds:
"Of these things I shall speak fully when I come in another part to
speak of the ancient religion of the Persians, and compare it with the
modern religion of the New Testament" But this part was never published.The part published was transcribed by Paine and given, not long before
his death, to the widow of Elihu Palmer, who published it in the
_Theophilanthropist_ in 1810.Paine had kept the other part, no doubt
for revision, and it passed with his effects into the hands of Madame
Bonneville, who eventually became a devotee.She either suppressed it or
sold it to some one who destroyed it.We can therefore only infer from
the above extract the author's belief on this momentous point.It seems
clear that he did not attribute any evil to the divine Being.In the
last article Paine published he rebukes the "Predestinarians" for
dwelling mainly on God's "physical attribute" of power."The Deists, in
addition to this, believe in his moral attributes, those of justice and
goodness."Among Paine's papers was found one entitled "My private thoughts of a
Future State," from which his editors have dropped important sentences."I have said in the first part of the Age of Reason that 'I hope for
happiness after this life,' This hope is comfortable to me, and I
presume not to go beyond the comfortable idea of hope, with respect to a
future state.I consider myself in the hands of my Creator, and that he
will dispose of me after this life, consistently with his justice and
goodness.I leave all these matters to him as my Creator and friend,
and I hold it to be presumption in man to make an article of faith as to
what the Creator will do with us hereafter.I do not believe, because
a man and a woman make a child, that it imposes on the Creator the
unavoidable obligation of keeping the being so made in eternal existence
hereafter.It is in his power to do so, or not to do so, and it is not
in our power to decide which he will do."[After quoting from Matthew
25th the figure of the sheep and goats he continues:] "The world cannot
be thus divided.The moral world, like the physical world, is composed
of numerous degrees of character, running imperceptibly one into the
other, in such a manner that no fixed point can be found in either.That
point is nowhere, or is everywhere.The whole world might be divided
into two parts numerically, but not as to moral character; and therefore
the metaphor of dividing them, as sheep and goats can be divided, whose
difference is marked by their external figure, is absurd.All sheep are
still sheep; all goats are still goats; it is their physical nature to
be so.But one part of the world are not all good alike, nor the
other part all wicked alike.There are some exceedingly good, others
exceedingly wicked.There is another description of men who cannot be
ranked with either the one or the other--they belong neither to the
sheep nor the goats.And there is still another description of them who
are so very insignificant, both in character and conduct, as not to be
worth the trouble of damning or saving, or of raising from the dead.My
own opinion is, that those whose lives have been spent in doing good,
and endeavouring to make their fellow mortals happy, for this is the
only way in which we can serve God, will be happy hereafter; and that
the very wicked will meet with some punishment.But those who are
neither good nor bad, or are too insignificant for notice, will be dropt
entirely.It is consistent with my idea of God's
justice, and with the reason that God has given me, and I gratefully
know that he has given me a large share of that divine gift."The closing tribute to his own reason, written in privacy, was, perhaps
pardonably, suppressed by the modern editor, and also the reference to
the insignificant who "will be dropt entirely."This sentiment is not
indeed democratic, but it is significant.It seems plain that Paine's
conception of the universe was dualistic.Though he discards the notion
of a devil, I do not find that he ever ridicules it.No doubt he would,
were he now living, incline to a division of nature into organic and
inorganic, and find his deity, as Zoroaster did, in the living as
distinguished from, and sometimes in antagonism with, the "not-living".In this belief he would now find himself in harmony with some of the
ablest modern philosophers.*

     * John Stuart Mill, for instance.Abbott's "Kernel and Husk" (London), and the great work of
     Samuel Laing, "A Modern Zoroastrian."{1806}

The opening year 1806 found Paine in New Rochelle.By insufficient
nourishment in Carver's house his health was impaired.His means were
getting low, insomuch that to support the Bonnevilles he had to sell the
Bordentown house and property.*

     * It was bought for $300 by his friend John Oliver, whose
     daughter, still residing in the house, told me that her
     father to the end of his life "thought everything of Paine."John Oliver, in his old age, visited Colonel Ingersoll in
     order to testify against the aspersions on Paine's character
     and habits.Elihu Palmer had gone off to Philadelphia for a time; he died there of
yellow fever in 1806.The few intelligent people whom Paine knew were
much occupied, and he was almost without congenial society.His hint to
Jefferson of his impending poverty, and his reminder that Virginia had
not yet given him the honorarium he and Madison approved, had brought
no result.With all this, and the loss of early friendships, and the
theological hornet-nest he had found in New York, Paine began to feel
that his return to America was a mistake.The air-castle that had allured him to his beloved land had faded.His
little room with the Bonnevilles in Paris, with its chaos of papers, was
preferable; for there at least he could enjoy the society of educated
persons, free from bigotry.He dwelt a stranger in his Land of Promise.So he resolved to try and free himself from his depressing environment.Jefferson had offered him a ship to
return in, perhaps he would now help him to get back.30th) a letter to the President, pointing out the probabilities of a
crisis in Europe which must result in either a descent on England by
Bonaparte, or in a treaty.In the case that the people of England should
be thus liberated from tyranny, he (Paine) desired to share with his
friends there the task of framing a republic.Should there be, on the
other hand, a treaty of peace, it would be of paramount interest to
American shipping that such treaty should include that maritime compact,
or safety of the seas for neutral ships, of which Paine had written
so much, and which Jefferson himself had caused to be printed in a
pamphlet.Both of these were, therefore, Paine's subjects."I think," he
says, "you will find it proper, perhaps necessary, to send a person to
France in the event of either a treaty or a descent, and I make you an
offer of my services on that occasion to join Mr.Monroe.... As I think
that the letters of a friend to a friend have some claim to an answer,
it will be agreeable to me to receive an answer to this, but without any
wish that you should commit yourself, neither can you be a judge of what
is proper or necessary to be done till about the month of April or May."Paine must face the fact that his
career is ended.It is probable that Elihu Palmer's visit to Philadelphia was connected
with some theistic movement in that city.How it was met, and what
annoyances Paine had to suffer, are partly intimated in the following
letter, printed in the Philadelphia _Commercial Advertiser_, February
10, 1806."To John Inskeep, Mayor of the City of Philadelphia."I saw in the Aurora of January the 30th a piece addressed to you and
signed Isaac Hall.It contains a statement of your malevolent conduct in
refusing to let him have Vine-st.Wharf after he had bid fifty
dollars more rent for it than another person had offered, and had been
unanimously approved of by the Commissioners appointed by law for that
purpose.Among the reasons given by you for this refusal, one was, that
'_Mr Hall was one of Paine's disciples_.'If those whom you may chuse to
call my disciples follow my example in doing good to mankind, they will
pass the confines of this world with a happy mind, while the hope of the
hypocrite shall perish and delusion sink into despair.Inskeep is, for I do not remember the name of
Inskeep at Philadelphia in '_the time that tried men's souls._* He must
be some mushroom of modern growth that has started up on the soil which
the generous services of Thomas Paine contributed to bless with freedom;
neither do I know what profession of religion he is of, nor do I care,
for if he is a man malevolent and unjust, it signifies not to what class
or sectary he may hypocritically belong."As I set too much value on my time to waste it on a man of so little
consequence as yourself, I will close this short address with a
declaration that puts hypocrisy and malevolence to defiance.Here it is:
My motive and object in all my political works, beginning with Common
Sense, the first work I ever published, have been to rescue man from
tyranny and false systems and false principles of government, and enable
him to be free, and establish government for himself; and I have borne
my share of danger in Europe and in America in every attempt I have made
for this purpose.And my motive and object in all my publications on
religious subjects, beginning with the first part of the Age of Reason,
have been to bring man to a right reason that God has given him; to
impress on him the great principles of divine morality, justice, mercy,
and a benevolent disposition to all men and to all creatures; and to
excite in him a spirit of trust, confidence and consolation in his
creator, unshackled by the fable and fiction of books, by whatever
invented name they may be called.I am happy in the continual
contemplation of what I have done, and I thank God that he gave
me talents for the purpose and fortitude to do it It will make the
continual consolation of my departing hours, whenever they finally
arrive."'_These are the times that try men's souls_.'1, written
while on the retreat with the army from fort Lee to the Delaware and
published in Philadelphia in the dark days of 1776 December the 19th,
six days before the taking of the Hessians at Trenton."But the year 1806 had a heavier blow yet to inflict on Paine, and
it naturally came, though in a roundabout way, from his old enemy
Gouverneur Morris.While at New Rochelle, Paine offered his vote at the
election, and it was refused, on the ground that he was not an American
citizen!The supervisor declared that the former American Minister,
Gouverneur Morris, had refused to reclaim him from a French prison
because he was not an American, and that Washington had also refused to
reclaim him.Gouverneur Morris had just lost his seat in Congress,
and was politically defunct, but his ghost thus rose on poor Paine's
pathway.The supervisor who disfranchised the author of "Common Sense"
had been a "Tory" in the Revolution; the man he disfranchised was one to
whom the President of the United States had written, five years before:
"I am in hopes you will find us returned generally to sentiments
worthy of former times.In these it will be your glory to have steadily
labored, and with as much effect as any man living."There was not any
question of Paine's qualification as a voter on other grounds than the
supervisor (Elisha Ward) raised.More must presently be said concerning
this incident.Paine announced his intention of suing the inspectors,
but meanwhile he had to leave the polls in humiliation.It was the fate
of this founder of republics to be a monument of their ingratitude.And
now Paine's health began to fail.An intimation of this appears in a
letter to Andrew A. Dean, to whom his farm at New Rochelle was let,
dated from New York, August, 1806.It is in reply to a letter from Dean
on a manuscript which Paine had lent him.*

     * "I have read," says Dean,  "with good attention your
     manuscript on dreams, and Examination of the Prophecies in
     the Bible.I am now searching the old prophecies, and
     comparing the same to those said to be quoted in the New
     Testament.I confess the comparison is a matter worthy of
     our serious attention; I know not the result till I finish;
     then, if you be living, I shall communicate the same to
     you.Paine was now living with
     Jarvis, the artist.One evening he fell as if by apoplexy,
     and, as he lay, his first word was (to Jarvis): "My
     corporeal functions have ceased; my intellect is clear;
     this is a proof of immortality.""Respected Friend: I received your friendly letter, for which I am
obliged to you.It is three weeks ago to day (Sunday, Aug.15,) that I
was struck with a fit of an apoplexy, that deprived me of all sense
and motion.I had neither pulse nor breathing, and the people about me
supposed me dead.I had felt exceedingly well that day, and had just
taken a slice of bread and butter for supper, and was going to bed.The
fit took me on the stairs, as suddenly as if I had been shot through the
head; and I got so very much hurt by the fall, that I have not been able
to get in and out of bed since that day, otherwise than being lifted
out in a blanket, by two persons; yet all this while my mental faculties
have remained as perfect as I ever enjoyed them.I consider the scene I
have passed through as an experiment on dying, and I find death has
no terrors for me.As to the people called Christians, they have no
evidence that their religion is true.There is no more proof that the
Bible is the word of God, than that the Koran of Mahomet is the word of
God.Man, before he begins to
think for himself, is as much the child of habit in Creeds as he is in
ploughing and sowing.Yet creeds, like opinions, prove nothing.Where is
the evidence that the person called Jesus Christ is the begotten Son of
God?The case admits not of evidence either to our senses or our mental
faculties: neither has God given to man any talent by which such a thing
is comprehensible.It cannot therefore be an object for faith to
act upon, for faith is nothing more than an assent the mind gives to
something it sees cause to believe is fact.But priests, preachers, and
fanatics, put imagination in the place of faith, and it is the nature
of the imagination to believe without evidence.If Joseph the carpenter
dreamed (as the book of Matthew, chapter 1st, says he did,) that his
betrothed wife, Mary, was with child by the Holy Ghost, and that an
angel told him so, I am not obliged to put faith in his dream; nor do I
put any, for I put no faith in my own dreams, and I should be weak and
foolish indeed to put faith in the dreams of others.--The Christian
religion is derogatory to the Creator in all its articles.It puts the
Creator in an inferior point of view, and places the Christian Devil
above him.It is he, according to the absurd story in Genesis, that
outwits the Creator, in the garden of Eden, and steals from him his
favorite creature, man; and, at last, obliges him to beget a son, and
put that son to death, to get man back again.And this the priests of
the Christian religion, call redemption."Christian authors exclaim against the practice of offering human
sacrifices, which, they say, is done in some countries; and those
authors make those exclamations without ever reflecting that their own
doctrine of salvation is founded on a human sacrifice.They are saved,
they say, by the blood of Christ.The Christian religion begins with a
dream and ends with a murder."As I am well enough to sit up some hours in the day, though not well
enough to get up without help, I employ myself as I have always done,
in endeavoring to bring man to the right use of the reason that God has
given him, and to direct his mind immediately to his Creator, and not to
fanciful secondary beings called mediators, as if God was superannuated
or ferocious."As to the book called the Bible, it is blasphemy to call it the word of
God.It is a book of lies and contradictions, and a history of bad times
and bad men.There are but a few good characters in the whole book.The
fable of Christ and his twelve apostles, which is a parody on the sun
and the twelve signs of the Zodiac, copied from the ancient religions of
the eastern world, is the least hurtful part.Every thing told of Christ
has reference to the sun.His reported resurrection is at sunrise,
and that on the first day of the week; that is, on the day anciently
dedicated to the sun, and from thence called Sunday; in latin Dies
Solis, the day of the sun; as the next day, Monday, is Moon day.But
there is no room in a letter to explain these things.While man keeps
to the belief of one God, his reason unites with his creed.He is not
shocked with contradictions and horrid stories.His bible is the heavens
and the earth.He beholds his Creator in all his works, and every thing
he beholds inspires him with reverence and gratitude.From the goodness
of God to all, he learns his duty to his fellow-man, and stands
self-reproved when he transgresses it.But
when he multiplies his creed with imaginary things, of which he can have
neither evidence nor conception, such as the tale of the garden of
Eden, the talking serpent, the fall of man, the dreams of Joseph the
carpenter, the pretended resurrection and ascension, of which there is
even no historical relation, for no historian of those times mentions
such a thing, he gets into the pathless region of confusion, and turns
either frantic or hypocrite.He forces his mind, and pretends to
believe what he does not believe.This is in general the case with the
Methodists."I have now my friend given you a fac-simile of my mind on the subject
of religion and creeds, and my wish is, that you may make this letter as
publicly known as you find opportunities of doing.{1807}

The "Essay on Dream" was written early in 1806 and printed in May,
1807.It was the last work of importance written by Paine.In the same
pamphlet was included a part of his reply to the Bishop of Llandaff,
which was written in France: "An Examination of the Passages in the New
Testament, quoted from the Old, and called Prophecies of the Coming
of Jesus Christ" The Examination is widely known and is among Paine's
characteristic works,--a continuation of the "Age of Reason."The "Essay
on Dream" is a fine specimen of the author's literary art.Dream is the
imagination awake while the judgment is asleep."Every person is mad
once in twenty-four hours; for were he to act in the day as he dreams
in the night, he would be confined for a lunatic."Nathaniel Hawthorne
thought spiritualism "a sort of dreaming awake."Paine explained in the
same way some of the stories on which popular religion is founded.The
incarnation itself rests on what an angel told Joseph in a dream, and
others are referred to."This story of dreams has thrown Europe into
a dream for more than a thousand years.All the efforts that nature,
reason, and conscience have made to awaken man from it have been
ascribed by priestcraft and superstition to the workings of the devil,
and had it not been for the American revolution, which by establishing
the universal right of conscience, first opened the way to free
discussion, and for the French revolution which followed, this religion
of dreams had continued to be preached, and that after it had ceased to
be believed."But Paine was to be reminded that the revolution had not made conscience
free enough in America to challenge waking dreams without penalties.The
following account of his disfranchisement at New Rochelle, was written
from Broome St., New York, May 4, 1807, to Vice-President Clinton."Respected Friend,--Elisha Ward and three or four other Tories who
lived within the british lines in the revolutionary war, got in to
be inspectors of the election last year at New Rochelle.These men refused my vote at the election, saying to me:
'You are not an American; our minister at Paris, Gouverneur Morris,
would not reclaim you when you were emprisoned in the Luxembourg prison
at Paris, and General Washington refused to do it.'Upon my telling
him that the two cases he stated were falsehoods, and that if he did me
injustice I would prosecute him, he got up, and calling for a constable,
said to me, 'I will commit you to prison.'He chose, however, to sit
down and go no farther with it.Monro's
letter to the then Secretary of State Randolph, in which Mr.Monro gives
the government an account of his reclaiming me and my liberation in
consequence of it; and also for an attested copy of Mr.Randolph's
answer, in which he says: 'The President approves what you have done in
the case of Mr.The matter I believe is, that, as I had not
been guillotined, Washington thought best to say what he did.As
to Gouverneur Morris, the case is that he did reclaim me; but his
reclamation did me no good, and the probability is, he did not intend it
should.Joel Barlow and other Americans in Paris had been in a body to
reclaim me, but their application, being unofficial, was not regarded.I shall subpoena Morris, and if I get attested
copies from the Secretary of State's office it will prove the lie on the
inspectors."As it is a new generation that has risen up since the declaration
of independence, they know nothing of what the political state of
the country was at the time the pamphlet 'Common Sense' appeared; and
besides this there are but few of the old standers left, and none that I
know of in this city."It may be proper at the trial to bring the mind of the court and the
jury back to the times I am speaking of, and if you see no objection in
your way, I wish you would write a letter to some person, stating, from
your own knowledge, what the condition of those times were, and the
effect which the work 'Common Sense,' and the several members (numbers)
of the 'Crisis' had upon the country.It would, I think, be best that
the letter should begin directly on the subject in this manner: Being
informed that Thomas Paine has been denied his rights of citizenship by
certain persons acting as inspectors at an election at New Rochelle, &c."I have put the prosecution into the hands of Mr.Riker, district
attorney, who can make use of the letter in his address to the Court and
Jury.Your handwriting can be sworn to by persons here, if necessary.Had you been on the spot I should have subpoenaed you, unless it had
been too inconvenient to you to have attended.To this Clinton replied from Washington, 12th May, 1807:

"Dear Sir,--I had the pleasure to receive your letter of the 4th
instant, yesterday; agreeably to your request I have this day written a
letter to Richard Riker, Esquire, which he will show you.I doubt much,
however, whether the Court will admit it to be read as evidence."I am indebted to you for a former letter.I can make no other apology
for not acknowledging it before than inability to give you such an
answer as I could wish.I constantly keep the subject in mind, and
should any favorable change take place in the sentiments of the
Legislature, I will apprize you of it."I am, with great esteem, your sincere friend."In the letter to Madison, Paine tells the same story.At the end he says
that Morris' reclamation was not out of any good will to him."I know
not what he wrote to the french minister; whatever it was he concealed
it from me."He also says Morris could hardly keep himself out of
prison.*

     * The letter is in Mr.Frederick McGuire's collection of
     Madison papers.A letter was also written to Joel Barlow, at Washington, dated Broome
Street, New York, May 4th.He says in this:

"I have prosecuted the Board of Inspectors for disfranchising me.You

I had got to be master of the feds and the priests.The former do not
attack my political publications; they rather try to keep them out of

Intelligencer.I
am somewhat at a loss for want of authentic intelligence.It will be seen that Paine was still in ignorance of the conspiracy
which had thrown him in prison, nor did he suspect that Washington
had been deceived by Gouverneur Morris, and that his private letter to
Washington might have been given over to Pickering.*

     * In Chapter X. of this volume, as originally printed, there
     were certain passages erroneously suggesting that Pickering
     might have even intercepted this important letter of
     September 20, 1795.I had not then observed a reference to
     that letter by Madison, in writing to Monroe (April 7,
     1796), which proves that Paine's communication to Washington
     had been read by Pickering.Monroe was anxious lest some
     attack on the President should be written by Paine while
     under his roof,--an impropriety avoided by Paine as we have
     seen,--and had written to Madison on the subject.Madison
     answers: "I have given the explanation you desired to F. A.
     M[uhlenberg], who has not received any letter as yet, and
     has promised to pay due regard to your request.It is proper
     you should know that Thomas Paine wrote some time ago a
     severe letter to the President which Pickering mentioned to
     me in harsh terms when I delivered a note from Thomas Paine
     to the Secretary of State, inclosed by T. P. in a letter to
     me.Nothing passed, however, that betrayed the least
     association of your patronage or attention to Thomas Paine
     with the circumstance; nor am I apprehensive that any real
     suspicion can exist of your countenancing or even knowing
     the steps taken by T. P. under the influence of his personal
     feelings or political principles.At the same time the
     caution you observe is by no means to be disapproved.Be so
     good as to let T. P. know that I have received his letter
     and handed his note to the Secretary of State, which
     requested copies of such letters as might have been written
     hence in his behalf.The note did not require any answer
     either to me or through me, and I have heard nothing of it
     since I handed it to Pickering."At this time the Secretary
     of State's office contained the President's official
     recognition of Paine's citizenship; but this application
     for the papers relating to his imprisonment by a foreign
     power received no reply, though it was evidently couched in
     respectful terms; as the letter was open for the eye of
     Madison, who would not have conveyed it otherwise.It is
     incredible that Washington could have sanctioned such an
     outrage on one he had recognized as an American citizen,
     unless under pressure of misrepresentations.Possibly
     Paine's Quaker and republican direction of his letter to
     "George Washington, President of the United States," was
     interpreted by his federalist ministers as an insult.It will be seen, by Madame Bonneville's and Jarvis' statements
elsewhere, that Paine lost his case against Elisha Ward, on what ground
it is difficult to imagine.The records of the Supreme Court, at Albany,
and the Clerk's office at White Plains, have been vainly searched for
any trace of this trial.John H. Riker, son of Paine's counsel, has
examined the remaining papers of Richard Riker (many were accidentally
destroyed) without finding anything related to the matter.It is so
terrible to think that with Jefferson, Clinton, and Madison at the head
of the government, and the facts so clear, the federalist Elisha Ward
could vindicate his insult to Thomas Paine, that it may be hoped the
publication of these facts will bring others to light that may put a
better face on the matter.*

     * Gilbert Vale relates an anecdote which suggests that a
     reaction may have occurred in Elisha Ward's family: "At the
     time of Mr.Paine's residence at his farm, Mr.Ward, now a
     coffee-roaster in Gold Street, New York, and an assistant
     alderman, was then a little boy and residing at New
     Rochelle.He remembers the impressions his mother and some
     religious people made on him by speaking of Tom Paine, so
     that he concluded that Tom Paine must be a very bad and
     brutal man.Some of his elder companions proposed going into
     Mr.Paine's orchard to obtain some fruit, and he, out of
     fear, kept at a distance behind, till he beheld, with
     surprise, Mr.Paine come out and assist the boys in getting
     apples, patting one on the head and caressing another, and
     directing them where to get the best.He then advanced and
     received his share of encouragement, and the impression this
     kindness made on him determined him at a very early period
     to examine his writings.His mother at first took the books
     from him, but at a later period restored them to him,
     observing that he was then of an age to judge for himself;
     perhaps she had herself been gradually undeceived, both as
     to his character and writings."Madame Bonneville may have misunderstood the procedure for which she
had to pay costs, as Paine's legatee.Whether an ultimate decision was
reached or not, the sufficiently shameful fact remains that Thomas Paine
was practically disfranchised in the country to which he had rendered
services pronounced pre-eminent by Congress, by Washington, and by every
soldier and statesman of the Revolution.Paine had in New York the most formidable of enemies,--an enemy with a
newspaper.This was James Cheetham, of whom something has been said in
the preface to this work (p.In addition to what is there stated,
it may be mentioned that Paine had observed, soon after he came to New
York, the shifty course of this man's paper, _The American Citizen_.But it was the only republican paper in New York, supported Governor
Clinton, for which it had reason, since it had the State printing,--and
Colonel Fellows advised that Cheetham should not be attacked.Cheetham
had been an attendant on Elihu Palmer's lectures, and after his
participation in the dinner to Paine, his federalist opponent, the
_Evening Post_, alluded to his being at Palmer's.Thereupon Cheetham
declared that he had not heard Palmer for two years.In the winter
of 1804 he casually spoke of Paine's "mischievous doctrines."In the
following year, when Paine wrote the defence of Jefferson's personal
character already alluded to, Cheetham omitted a reference in it
to Alexander Hamilton's pamphlet, by which he escaped accusation of
official defalcation by confessing an amorous intrigue.*

     *  "I see that Cheetham has left out the part respecting
     Hamilton and Mrs.Reynolds, but for my own part I wish it
     had been in.Had the story never been publicly told I
     would not have been the first to tell it; but Hamilton had
     told it himself, and therefore it was no secret; but my
     motive in introducing it was because it was applicable to
     the subject I was upon, and to show the revilers of Mr.Jefferson that while they are affecting a morality of horror
     at an unproved and unfounded story about Mr.Jefferson, they
     had better look at home and give vent to their horror, if
     they had any, at a real case of their own Dagon (sic) and
     his Delilah."--Paine to Colonel Fellows, July 31, 1805.Cheetham having been wont to write of Hamilton as "the gallant of Mrs.Reynolds," Paine did not give much credit to the pretext of respect for
the dead, on which the suppression was justified.He was prepared to
admit that his allusion might be fairly suppressed, but perceived that
the omission was made merely to give Cheetham a chance for vaunting his
superior delicacy, and casting a suspicion on Paine."Cheetham," wrote
Paine, "might as well have put the part in, as put in the reasons for
which he left it out.Those reasons leave people to suspect that the
part suppressed related to some new discovered immorality in Hamilton
worse than the old story."About the same time with Paine, an Irishman came to America, and, after
travelling about the country a good deal, established a paper in New
York called _The People's Friend_.This paper began a furious onslaught
on the French, professed to have advices that Napoleon meant to retake
New Orleans, and urged an offensive alliance of the United States with
England against France and Spain.These articles appeared in the early
autumn of 1806, when, as we have seen, Paine was especially beset by
personal worries.His denunciations, merited as
they were, of this assailant of France reveal the unstrung condition of
the old author's nerves.Duane, of the Philadelphia _Aurora_, recognized
in Carpenter a man he had seen in Calcutta, where he bore the name of
Cullen.It was then found that he had on his arrival in America borne
the _alias_ of Mac-cullen.Paine declared that he was an "emissary"
sent to this country by Windham, and indeed most persons were at length
satisfied that such was the case.Paine insisted that loyalty to our
French alliance demanded Cullen's expulsion.His exposures of "the
emissary Cullen" (who disappeared) were printed in a new republican
paper in New York, _The Public Advertiser_, edited by Mr.The
combat drew public attention to the new paper, and Cheetham was probably
enraged by Paines transfer of his pen to Frank.In 1807, Paine had a
large following in New York, his friends being none the less influential
among the masses because not in the fashionable world Moreover, the
very popular Mayor of New York, De Witt Clinton, was a hearty admirer
of Paine.So Cheetham's paper suffered sadly, and he opened his guns
on Paine, declaring that in the Revolution he (Paine) "had stuck very
correctly to his pen in a safe retreat," that his "Rights of Man" merely
repeated Locke, and so forth.He also began to denounce France and
applaud England, which led to the belief that, having lost republican
patronage, Cheetham was aiming to get that of England.In a "Reply to Cheetham" (August 21st), Paine met personalities in kind.Cheetham, in his rage for attacking everybody and everything that
is not his own (for he is an ugly-tempered man, and he carries
the evidence of it in the vulgarity and forbiddingness of his
countenance--God has set a mark upon Cain), has attacked me, etc."In
reply to further attacks, Paine printed a piece headed "Cheetham and his
Tory Paper."He said that Cheetham was discovering symptoms of being
the successor of Cullen, _alias_ Carpenter."Like him he is seeking to
involve the United States in a quarrel with France for the benefit of
England."This article caused a duel between the rival editors, Cheetham
and Frank, which seems to have been harmless.Paine wrote a letter
to the _Evening Post_, saying that he had entreated Frank to answer
Cheetham's challenge by declaring that he (Paine) had written the
article and was the man to be called to account.In company Paine
mentioned an opinion expressed by the President in a letter just
received.This got into the papers, and Cheetham declared that the
President could not have so written, and that Paine was intoxicated
when he said so.For this Paine instituted a suit against Cheetham for
slander, but died before any trial.Paine had prevailed with his pen, but a terrible revenge was plotted
against his good name.The farrier William Carver, in whose house he
had lived, turned Judas, and concocted with Cheetham the libels against
Paine that have passed as history.PERSONAL TRAITS

On July 1, 1806, two young English gentlemen, Daniel and William
Constable, arrived in New York, and for some years travelled about the
country.The Diary kept by Daniel Constable has been shown me by his
nephew, Clair J. Grece, LL.D.It contains interesting allusions to
Paine, to whom they brought an introduction from Rickman.To the Globe, in Maiden Lane, to dine.Segar at the Globe
offered to send for Mr.Paine, who lived only a few doors off: He seemed
a true Painite.William and I went to see Thomas Paine.When we first called he was
taking a nap.... Back to Mr.Paine's about 5 o'clock, sat about an
hour with him.... I meant to have had T. Paine in a carriage with me
to-morrow, and went to inquire for one.The price was $1 per hour, but
when I proposed it to T. P. he declined it on account of his health.We
were up by five o'clock, and on the battery saw the cannons fired, in
commemoration of liberty, which had been employed by the English against
the sacred cause.The people seemed to enter into the spirit of the day:
stores &c were generally shut.... In the fore part of the day I had the
honour of walking with T. Paine along the Broadway.The day finished
peaceably, and we saw no scenes of quarreling or drunkenness.Evening, met T. Paine in the Broadway and walked
with him to his house.Called to see T. Paine, who was
walking about Carver's shop."Changed snuff-boxes with T. Paine at his lodgings.* The old
philosopher, in bed at 4 o'clock afternoon, seems as talkative and well
as when we saw him in the summer."Grece showed me Paine's papier-mache snuff-box, which
     his uncle had fitted with silver plate, inscription,
     decorative eagle, and banner of "Liberty, Equality."It is
     kept in a jewel-box with an engraving of Paine on the lid.In a letter written jointly by the brothers to their parents, dated July
5th, they say that Paine "begins to feel the effects of age.The print
I left at Horley is a very strong likeness.He lives with a small family
who came from Lewes [Carvers] quite retired, and but little known or
noticed."They here also speak of "the honour of walking with our old
friend T. Paine in the midst of the bustle on Independence Day."There
is no suggestion, either here or in the Diary, that these gentlemen of
culture and position observed anything in the appearance or habits of
Paine that diminished the pleasure of meeting him.In November they
travelled down the Mississippi, and on their return to New York, nine
months later, they heard (July 20, 1807) foul charges against Paine
from Carver."Paine has left his house, and they have had a violent
disagreement.Carver charges Paine with many foul vices, as debauchery,
lying, ingratitude, and a total want of common honour in all his
actions, says that he drinks regularly a quart of brandy per day."But
next day they call on Paine, in "the Bowery road," and William Constable
writes:

"He looks better than last year.He read us an essay on national
defence, comparing the different expenses and powers of gunboats and
ships of war and, batteries in protecting a sea coast; and gave D. C.[Daniel Constable] a copy of his Examination of the texts of scriptures
called prophecies, etc.He says
that this work is of too high a cut for the priests and that they will
not touch it."These brothers Constable met Fulton, a friend of Paine's just then
experimenting with his steam-boat on the Hudson.They also found that a
scandal had been caused by a report brought to the British Consul that
thirty passengers on the ship by which they (the Constables) came, had
"the Bible bound up with the 'Age of Reason,' and that they spoke in
very disrespectful terms of the mother country."Paine had left his
farm at New Rochelle, at which place the travellers heard stories of
his slovenliness, also that he was penurious, though nothing was said of
intemperance.Inquiry among aged residents of New Rochelle has been made from time to
time for a great many years.J. B. Stallo, late U. S. Minister
to Italy, told me that in early life he visited the place and saw
persons who had known Paine, and declared that Paine resided there
without fault.Staple, brother of the
influential Captain Pelton, and the adoption of Paine's religious views
by some of these persons caused the odium.* Paine sometimes preached at
New Rochelle.Burger, Pelton's clerk, used to drive Paine about
     daily.Vale says:

     "He [Burger] describes Mr.Paine as really abstemious, and
     when pressed to drink by those on whom he called during his
     rides, he usually refused with great firmness, but politely.In one of these rides he was met by De Witt Clinton, and
     their mutual greetings were extremely hearty.Paine
     at this time was the reverse of morose, and though careless
     of his dress and prodigal of his snuff, he was always clean
     and well clothed.Burger describes him as familiar with
     children and humane to animals, playing with the neighboring
     children, and communicating a friendly pat even to a passing
     dog."Our frontispiece shows Paine's dress in 1803.Cheetham publishes a correspondence purporting to have passed between
Paine and Carver, in November, 1806, in which the former repudiates
the latter's bill for board (though paying it), saying he was badly
and dishonestly treated in Carver's house, and had taken him out of his
Will.To this a reply is printed, signed by Carver, which he certainly
never wrote; specimens of his composition, now before me, prove him
hardly able to spell a word correctly or to frame a sentence.*

     * In the Concord (Mass.)Public Library there is a copy of
     Cheetham's book, which belonged to Carver, by whom it was
     filled with notes.He says: "Cheetham was a hypocrate turned
     Tory," "Paine was not Drunk when he wrote the thre pedlars
     for me, I sold them to a gentleman, a Jew for a dollar--
     Cheetham knew that he told a lie saying Paine was drunk--any
     person reading Cheetham's life of Paine that [sic] his pen
     was guided by prejudice that was brought on by Cheetham's
     altering a peice that Paine had writen as an answer to a
     peice that had apeared in his paper, I had careyd the peice
     to Cheetham, the next Day the answer was printed with the
     alteration, Paine was angry, sent me to call Cheetham I then
     asked how he undertook to mutilate the peice, if aney thing
     was rong he knew ware to find him & sad he never permitted a
     printer to alter what he had wrote, that the sence of the
     peice was spoiled--by this means their freind ship was
     broken up through life------"   (The marginalia in this
     volume have been copied for me with exactness by Miss E. G.
     Crowell, of Concord.)The letter in Cheetham shows a practised hand, and was evidently written
for Carver by the "biographer."This ungenuineness of Carver's
letter, and expressions not characteristic in that of Paine render the
correspondence mythical.Although Carver passed many penitential years
hanging about Paine celebrations, deploring the wrong he had done Paine,
he could not squarely repudiate the correspondence, to which Cheetham
had compelled him to swear in court.He used to declare that Cheetham
had obtained under false pretences and printed without authority letters
written in anger.But thrice in his letter to Paine Carver says he means
to publish it.Its closing words are: "There may be many grammatical
errours in this letter.To you I have no apologies to make; but I hope a
candid and impartial public will not view them 'with a critick's eye.'"This is artful; besides the fling at Paine's faulty grammar, which
Carver could not discover, there is a pretence to faults in his own
letter which do not exist, but certainly would have existed had he
written it The style throughout is transparently Cheethan's.* "A Bone to Gnaw for Grant Thorburn."By W. Carver
     (1836).In the book at Concord the unassisted Carver writes: "The libel for
wich [sic] he [Cheetham] was sued was contained in the letter I wrote to
Paine."This was the libel on Madame Bonneville, Carver's antipathy
to whom arose from his hopes of Paine's property.In reply to Paine's
information, that he was excluded from his Will, Carver says: "I
likewise have to inform you, that I totally disregard the power of your
mind and pen; for should you, by your conduct, permit this letter to
appear in public, in vain may you attempt to print or publish any thing
afterwards."Carver's letter
is dated December 2, 1806.It was not published during Paine's life,
for the farrier hoped to get back into the Will by frightening Madame
Bonneville and other friends of Paine with the stories he meant to tell.About a year before Paine's death he made another blackmailing attempt.He raked up the scandalous stories published by "Oldys" concerning
Paine's domestic troubles in Lewes, pretending that he knew the facts
personally.Carver has offered me an affidavit,"
says Cheetham."He stated them all to Paine in a private letter which he
wrote to him a year before his death; to which no answer was returned.Carver showed me the letter soon after it was written."On this
plain evidence of long conspiracy with Cheetham, and attempt to
blackmail Paine when he was sinking in mortal illness, Carver never
made any comment.When Paine was known to be near his end Carver made
an effort at conciliation."I think it a pity," he wrote, "that you
or myself should depart this life with envy in our hearts against each
other--and I firmly believe that no difference would have taken place
between us, had not some of your pretended friends endeavored to have
caused a separation of friendship between us."But abjectness was not
more effectual than blackmail.The property went to the Bonnevilles,
and Carver, who had flattered Paine's "great mind," in the letter
just quoted, proceeded to write a mean one about the dead author for
Cheetham's projected biography.He did not, however, expect Cheetham to
publish his slanderous letter about Paine and Madame Bonneville, which
he meant merely for extortion; nor could Cheetham have got the letter
had he not written it.All of Cheetham's libels on Paine's life in New
York are amplifications of Carver's insinuations.In describing Cheetham
as "an abominable liar," Carver passes sentence on himself.On this
blackmailer, this confessed libeller, rest originally and fundamentally
the charges relating to Paine's last years.It has already been stated that Paine boarded for a time in the Bayeaux
mansion.In 1891 I
visited, at New Rochelle, Mr.Albert Badeau, son of the lady last named,
finding him, as I hope he still is, in good health and memory.Seated
in the arm-chair given him by his mother, as that in which Paine used
to sit by their fireside, I took down for publication some words of
his."My mother would never tolerate the aspersions on Mr.She declared steadfastly to the end of her life that he was a
perfect gentleman, and a most faithful friend, amiable, gentle,
never intemperate in eating or drinking.My mother declared that my
grandmother equally pronounced the disparaging reports about Mr.I never remember to have seen my mother angry except when she
heard such calumnies of Mr.Paine, when she would almost insult those
who uttered them.My mother and grandmother were very religious, members
of the Episcopal Church."Albert Badeau's religious opinions
are I do not know, but no one acquainted with that venerable gentleman
could for an instant doubt his exactness and truthfulness.It
certainly was not until some years after his return to America that any
slovenliness could be observed about Paine, and the contrary was often
remarked in former times.* After he had come to New York, and was
neglected by the pious ladies and gentlemen with whom he had once
associated, he neglected his personal appearance."Let those dress who
need it," he said to a friend.* "He dined at my table," said Aaron Burr."I always
     considered Mr.Paine a gentleman, a pleasant companion, and
     a good-natured and intelligent man; decidedly temperate,
     with a proper regard for his personal appearance, whenever I
     have seen him."says Joel Barlow, "he was generally very
     cleanly, though careless, and wore his hair queued with side
     curls, and powdered, like a gentleman of the old French
     School.His manners were easy and gracious, his knowledge
     universal."Paine was prodigal of snuff, but used tobacco in no other form.He had
aversion to profanity, and never told or listened to indecent anecdotes.With regard to the charges of excessive drinking made against Paine, I
have sifted a vast mass of contrarious testimonies, and arrived at the
following conclusions.In earlier life Paine drank spirits, as was the
custom in England and America; and he unfortunately selected brandy,
which causes alcoholic indigestion, and may have partly produced the
oft-quoted witness against him--his somewhat red nose.His nose was
prominent, and began to be red when he was fifty-five.That was just
after he had been dining a good deal with rich people in England, and
at public dinners.During his early life in England (1737--1774) no
instance of excess was known, and Paine expressly pointed the Excise
Office to his record."No complaint of the least dishonesty or
intemperance has ever appeared against me."His career in America
(1774-1787) was free from any suspicion of intemperance.John Hall's
daily diary while working with Paine for months is minute, mentioning
everything, but in no case is a word said of Paine's drinking.Paine's enemy, Chalmers ("Oldys"), raked up in 1791 every
charge he could against Paine, but intemperance is not included.Paine
told Rickman that in Paris, when borne down by public and private
affliction, he had been driven to excess.That period I have identified
on a former page (ii., p.59) as a few weeks in 1793, when his dearest
friends were on their way to the guillotine, whither he daily expected
to follow them.After that Paine abstained altogether from spirits, and
drank wine in moderation.Lovett, who kept the City Hotel, New York,
where Paine stopped in 1803 and 1804 for some weeks, wrote a note to
Caleb Bingham, of Boston, in which he says that Paine drank less
than any of his boarders.Gilbert Vale, in preparing his biography,
questioned D. Burger, the clerk of Pelton's store at New Rochelle, and
found that Paine's liquor supply while there was one quart of rum per
week.He also questioned Jarvis, the
artist, in whose house Paine resided in New York (Church Street) five
months, who declared that what Cheetham had reported about Paine and
himself was entirely false.Paine, he said, "did not and could not drink
much."In July, 1809, just after Paine's death, Cheetham wrote
Barlow for information concerning Paine, "useful in illustrating his
character," and said: "He was a great drunkard here, and Mr.M., a
merchant of this city, who lived with him when he was arrested by order
of Robespierre, tells me he was intoxicated when that event happened."Barlow, recently returned from Europe, was living just out of
Washington; he could know nothing of Cheetham's treachery, and fell into
his trap; he refuted the story of "Mr.M.," of course, but took it for
granted that a supposed republican editor would tell the truth about
Paine in New York, and wrote of the dead author as having "a mind,
though strong enough to bear him up and to rise elastic under the
heaviest hand of oppression, yet unable to endure the contempt of his
former friends and fellow-laborers, the rulers of the country that had
received his first and greatest services; a mind incapable of looking
down with serene compassion, as it ought, on the rude scoffs of their
imitators, a new generation that knows him not; a mind that shrinks from
their society, and unhappily seeks refuge in low company, or looks for
consolation in the sordid, solitary bottle, etc."!Barlow, misled as he
was, well knew Paine's nature, and that if he drank to excess it was not
from appetite, but because of ingratitude and wrong.The man was not a
stock or a stone.If any can find satisfaction in the belief that Paine
found no Christian in America so merciful as rum, they may perhaps
discover some grounds for it in a brief period of his sixty-ninth year.While living in the house of Carver, Paine was seized with an illness
that threatened to be mortal, and from which he never fully recovered.It is probable that he was kept alive for a time by spirits during the
terrible time, but this ceased when in the latter part of 1806 he left
Carver's to live with Jarvis.In the spring of 1808 he resided in the
house of Mr.Hitt, a baker, in Broome Street, and there remained
ten months.Hitt reports that Paine's weekly supply then--his
seventy-second year, and his last--was three quarts of rum per week.* Todd's "Joel Barlow," p.was one
     Murray, an English speculator in France, where he never
     resided with Paine at all.After Paine had left Carver's he became acquainted with more people.The late Judge Tabor's recollections have been sent me by his son, Mr."I was an associate editor of the _New York Beacon_ with Col.John
Fellows, then (1836) advanced in years, but retaining all the vigor and
fire of his manhood.He was a ripe scholar, a most agreeable companion,
and had been the correspondent and friend of Jefferson, Madison, Monroe
and John Quincy Adams, under all of whom he held a responsible office.One of his productions was dedicated, by permission, to [J.Adams,
and was republished and favorably received in England.Fellows
was the soul of honor and inflexible in his adherence to truth.He was
intimate with Paine during the whole time he lived after returning to
this country, and boarded for a year in the same house with him."I also was acquainted with Judge Hertell, of New York City, a man of
wealth and position, being a member of the New York Legislature, both
in the Senate and Assembly, and serving likewise on the judicial bench.Fellows, he was an author, and a man of unblemished life and
irreproachable character."These men assured me of their own knowledge derived from constant
personal intercourse during the last seven years of Paine's life, that
he never kept any company but what was entirely respectable, and that
all accusations of drunkenness were grossly untrue.They saw him under
all circumstances and _knew_ that he was never intoxicated.Nay, more,
they said, for that day, he was even abstemious.That was a drinking age
and Paine, like Jefferson, could 'bear but little spirit,' so that he
was constitutionally temperate."Cheetham refers to William Carver and the portrait painter Jarvis.I
visited Carver, in company with Col.Fellows, and naturally conversed
with the old man about Paine.He said that the allegation that Paine was
a drunkard was altogether without foundation.In speaking of his letter
to Paine which Cheetham published, Carver said that he was angry when
he wrote it and that he wrote unwisely, as angry men generally do;
that Cheetham obtained the letter under false pretenses and printed it
without authority.Fellows and Judge Hertell visited Paine throughout the whole
course of his last illness.They repeatedly conversed with him
on religious topics and they declared that he died serenely,
philosophically and resignedly.This information I had directly from
their own lips, and their characters were so spotless, and their
integrity so unquestioned, that more reliable testimony it would be
impossible to give."During Paine's life the world heard no hint of sexual immorality
connected with him, but after his death Cheetham published the
following: "Paine brought with him from Paris, and from her husband in
whose house he had lived, Margaret Brazier Bonneville, and her three
sons._Thomas_ has the features, countenance, and temper of Paine,"
Madame Bonneville promptly sued Cheetham for slander.Cheetham had
betrayed his "pal," Carver, by printing the letter concocted to
blackmail Paine, for whose composition the farrier no doubt supposed
he had paid the editor with stories borrowed from "Oldys," or not
actionable.Cheetham probably recognized, when he saw Madame Bonneville
in court, that he too had been deceived, and that any illicit relation
between the accused lady and Paine, thirty years her senior, was
preposterous.Cheetham's lawyer (Griffin) insinuated terrible things
that his witnesses were to prove, but they all dissolved into Carver.Ryder, with whom Paine had boarded, admitted trying to make Paine
smile by saying Thomas was like him, but vehemently repudiated the
slander.She never saw but
decency with Mrs.She never staid there but one night, when
Paine was very sick."Dean was summoned to support one of Carver's
lies that Madame Bonneville tried to cheat Paine, but denied the whole
story (which has unfortunately been credited by Vale and other writers).Foster, who had a claim against Paine's estate for tuition
of the Bonnevilles, was summoned.Bonneville," he testified,
"might possibly have said as much as that but for Paine she would not
have come here, and that he was under special obligations to provide for
her children."A Westchester witness, Peter Underbill, testified that
"he one day told Mrs.Bonneville that her child resembled Paine,
and Mrs.Bonneville said it was Paine's child."But, apart from the
intrinsic incredibility of this statement (unless she meant "god-son"),
Underbill's character broke down under the testimony of his neighbors,
Judge Sommerville and Captain Pelton.Cheetham had thus no dependence
but Carver, who actually tried to support his slanders from the dead
lips of Paine!But in doing so he ruined Cheetham's case by saying that
Paine told him Madame Bonneville was never the wife of M. Bonneville;
the charge being that she was seduced from her husband.It was extorted
from Carver that Madame Bonneville, having seen his scurrilous letter to
Paine, threatened to prosecute him; also that he had taken his wife to
visit Madame Bonneville.Then it became plain to Carver that Cheetham's
case was lost, and he deserted it on the witness-stand; declaring that
"he had never seen the slightest indication of any meretricious or
illicit commerce between Paine and Mrs.Bonneville, that they never were
alone together, and that all the three children were alike the objects
of Paine's care."Counsellor Sampson (no friend to Paine) perceived that
Paine's Will was at the bottom of the business."That is the key to this
mysterious league of apostolic slanderers, mortified expectants and
disappointed speculators."Sampson's invective was terrific; Cheetham
rose and claimed protection of the court, hinting at a duel.Sampson
took a pinch of snuff, and pointing his finger at the defendant, said:

"If he complains of personalities, he who is hardened in every gross
abuse, he who lives reviling and reviled, who might construct himself
a monument with no other materials but those records to which he is a
party, and in which he stands enrolled as an offender*: if he cannot sit
still to hear his accusation, but calls for the protection of the court
against a counsel whose duty it is to make his crimes appear, how does
she deserve protection, whom he has driven to the sad necessity of
coming here to vindicate her honor, from those personalities he has
lavished on her?"* Cheetham was at the moment a defendant in  nine or ten
     cases for libel.The editor of Counsellor Sampson's speech says that the jury "although
composed of men of different political sentiments, returned in a few
minutes a verdict of guilty."It is added:

"The court, however, when the libeller came up the next day to receive
his sentence, highly commended the book which contained the libellous
publication, declared that it tended to serve the cause of religion, and
imposed no other punishment on the libeller than the payment of $150,
with a direction that the costs be taken out of it.It is fit to remark,
lest foreigners who are unacquainted with our political condition should
receive erroneous impressions, that Mr.Recorder Hoffman does not belong
to the Republican party in America, but has been elevated to office
by men in hostility to it, who obtained a temporary ascendency in the
councils of state."*

     the Trial of James Cheetham, Esq., for a libel on Margaret
     Brazier Bonneville, in his Memoirs of Thomas Paine.Philadelphia: Printed by John Sweeny, No-357 Arch Street,
     1810."I am indebted for the use of this rare pamphlet and
     for other information, to the industrious collector of
     causes celebres, Mr.E. B. Wynn, of Watertown, N. Y.

Madame Bonneville had in court eminent witnesses to her
character,--Thomas Addis Emmet, Fulton, Jarvis, and ladies whose
children she had taught French.Yet the scandal was too tempting an
illustration of the "Age of Reason" to disappear with Cheetham's defeat.Americans in their peaceful habitations were easily made suspicious of a
French woman who had left her husband in Paris and followed Paine; they
could little realize the complications into which ten tempestuous years
had thrown thousands of families in France, and how such poor radicals
as the Bonnevilles had to live as they could.The scandal branched into
variants.Twenty-five years later pious Grant Thorburn promulgated that
Paine had run off from Paris with the wife of a tailor named Palmer."Paine made no scruples of living with this woman openly."Elihu
Palmer, in her penury, was employed by Paine to attend to his rooms,
etc, during a few months of illness.)As to Madame Bonneville, whose
name Grant Thorburn seems not to have heard, she was turned into a
romantic figure.Thorburn says that Paine escaped the guillotine by the
execution of another man in his place."The man who suffered death for Paine, left a widow, with two young
children in poor circumstances.Paine brought them all to this country,
supported them while he lived, and, it is said, left most of his
property to them when he died.The widow and children lived in
apartments up town by themselves.I believe
his conduct was disinterested and honorable to the widow.She appeared
to be about thirty years of age, and was far from being handsome."*

     * "Forty Years' Residence in America."Grant Thorburn was afterwards led to doubt whether this woman was
the widow of the man guillotined, but declares that when "Paine first
brought her out, he and his friends passed her off as such."As a myth
of the time (1834), and an indication that Paine's generosity to
the Bonneville family was well known in New York, the story is worth
quoting.But the Bonnevilles never escaped from the scandal.Long years
afterward, when the late Gen.Louis, it
was whispered about that he was the natural son of Thomas Paine, though
he was born before Paine ever met Madame Bonneville.Of course it
has gone into the religious encyclopaedias.The best of them, that of
McClintock and Strong, says: "One of the women he supported [in France]
followed him to this country."After the fall of Napoleon, Nicholas
Bonneville, relieved of his surveillance, hastened to New York, where
he and his family were reunited, and enjoyed the happiness provided by
Paine's self-sacrificing economy.The present writer, having perused some thou-sands of documents
concerning Paine, is convinced that no charge of sensuality could have
been brought against him by any one acquainted with the facts, except
out of malice.Had Paine held, or practised, any latitudinarian theory
of sexual liberty, it would be recorded here, and his reasons for
the same given.And as to his sacrificing the happiness of
a home to his own pleasure, nothing could be more inconceivable.Above all, Paine was a profoundly religious man,--one of the few in our
revolutionary era of whom it can be said that his delight was in the law
of his Lord, and in that law did he meditate day and night Consequently,
he could not escape the immemorial fate of the great believers, to be
persecuted for unbelief--by unbelievers.DEATH AND RESURRECTION

The blow that Paine received by the refusal of his vote at New Rochelle
was heavy.Elisha Ward, a Tory in the Revolution, had dexterously
gained power enough to give his old patrons a good revenge on the first
advocate of independence.The blow came at a time when his means were
low, and Paine resolved to apply to Congress for payment of an old debt.The response would at once relieve him, and overwhelm those who were
insulting him in New York.This led to a further humiliation, and one or
two letters to Congress, of which Paine's enemies did not fail to make
the most.* Paine had always felt that Congress was in his debt for
     his voyage to France for supplies with Col.20, 1782) to Robert Morris, Paine
     mentions that when Col.Laurens proposed that he should
     accompany him, as secretary, he was on the point of
     establishing a newspaper.He had purchased twenty reams of
     paper, and Mr.Eustatia for seventy
     more.This scheme, which could hardly fail of success, was
     relinquished for the voyage.It was undertaken at the urgent
     solicitation of Laurens, and Paine certainly regarded it as
     official.He had ninety dollars when he started, in bills of
     exchange; when Col.Laurens left him, after their return,
     he had but two louis d'or.The Memorial sent by Paine to
     Congress (Jan.21, 1808) recapitulated facts known to my
     reader.George Clinton, Jr.,
     February 4, and referred to the Committee of Claims.On
     February 14th Paine wroth a statement concerning the $3,000
     given him (1785) by Congress, which he maintained was an
     indemnity for injustice done him in the Deane case.The Committee consulted the
     President, whose reply I know not.Vice-President Clinton
     wrote (Mardi 23, 1808) that  from the information I received
     at the time I have reason to believe that Mr.Paine
     accompanied Col.Laurens on his mission to France in the
     course of our revolutionary war, for the purpose of
     negotiating a loan, and that he acted as his secretary on
     that occasion; but although I have no doubt of the truth of
     this fact, I cannot assert it from my own actual knowledge."There was nothing found on the journals of Congress to show
     Paine's connection with the mission.The old author was
     completely upset by his longing to hear the fate of his
     memorial, and he Wrote two complaints of the delay, showing
     that his nerves were shattered.he says, March 7th,
     "my memorial was referred to the Committee of Claims for the
     purpose of losing it, it is unmanly policy.After so many
     years of service my heart grows cold towards America."The letters are those of a broken-hearted man, and it seems marvellous
that Jefferson, Madison, and the Clintons did not intervene and see that
some recognition of Paine's former services, by those who should not
have forgotten them, was made without the ill-judged memorial.While
they were enjoying their grandeur the man who, as Jefferson wrote,
"steadily laboured, and with as much effect as any man living," to
secure America freedom, was living--or rather dying--in a miserable
lodging-house, 63 Partition Street.He had gone there for economy; for
he was exhibiting that morbid apprehension about his means which is
a well-known symptom of decline in those who have suffered poverty in
early life.Washington, with 40,000 acres, wrote in his last year as if
facing ruin.Paine had only a little farm at New Rochelle.He had for
some time suffered from want of income, and at last had to sell the farm
he meant for the Bonnevilles for $10,000; but the purchaser died, and at
his widow's appeal the contract was cancelled.It was at this time that
he appealed to Congress.It appears, however, that Paine was not anxious
for himself, but for the family of Madame Bonneville, whose statement on
this point is important.The last letter that I can find of Paine's was: written to Jefferson,
July 8, 1808:

"The british Ministry have out-schemed themselves.It is not difficult
to see what the motive and object of that Ministry: were in issuing
the orders of Council.They expected those orders would force all the
commerce of the United States to England, and then, by giving permission
to such cargoes as they did not want for themselves to depart for the
Continent of Europe, to raise a revenue out of those countries and
America.'But instead of this they have lost revenue; that is, they
have-lost the revenue they used to receive from American imports, and
instead of gaining all the commerce they have lost it all."This being the case with the british Ministry it is natural to suppose
they would be glad to tread back their steps, if they could do it
without too much exposing their ignorance and obstinacy.The Embargo
law empowers the President to suspend its operation whenever he shall be
satisfied that our ships can pass in safety.It therefore includes the
idea of empowering him to use means for arriving at that event.Suppose
the President were to authorise Mr.Pinckney to propose to the british
Ministry that the United States would negociate with France for
rescinding the Milan Decree, on condition the English Ministry would
rescind their orders of Council; and in that case the United States
would recall their Embargo.France and England stand now at such a
distance that neither can propose any thing to the other, neither are
there any neutral powers to act as mediators.The U. S. is the only
power that can act."Perhaps the british Ministry if they listen to the proposal will want
to add to it the Berlin decree, which excludes english commerce from the
continent of Europe; but this we have nothing to do with, neither has it
any thing to do with the Embargo.The british Orders of Council and the
Milan decree are parallel cases, and the cause of the Embargo.Paines last letters to the President are characteristic.One pleads for
American intervention to stay the hand of French oppression among the
<DW64>s in St.Domingo; for the colonization of Louisiana with free
<DW64> laborers; and his very last letter is an appeal for mediation
between France and England for the sake of peace.Nothing came of these pleadings of Paine; but perhaps on his last stroll
along the Hudson, with his friend Fulton, to watch the little steamer,
he may have recognized the real mediator beginning its labors for the
federation of the world.Early in July, 1808, Paine removed to a comfortable abode, that of Mrs.Ryder, near which Madame Bonneville and her two sons resided.The house
was on Herring Street (afterwards 293 Bleecker), and not far, he might
be pleased to find, from "Reason Street."Here he made one more attempt
to wield his pen,--the result being a brief letter "To the Federal
Faction," which he warns that they are endangering American commerce by
abusing France and Bonaparte, provoking them to establish a navigation
act that will exclude American ships from Europe."The United States
have flourished, unrivalled in commerce, fifteen or sixteen years.But
it is not a permanent state of things.It arose from the circumstances
of the war, and most probably will change at the close of the present
war.The Federalists give provocation enough to promote it."Apparently this is the last letter Paine ever sent to the printer.The
year passed peacefully away; indeed there is reason to believe that
from the middle of July, 1808, to the end of January, 1809, he fairly
enjoyed existence.During this time he made acquaintance with the worthy
Willett Hicks, watchmaker, who was a Quaker preacher.His conversations
with Willett Hicks--whose cousin, Elias Hicks, became such an
important figure in the Quaker Society twenty years later--were
fruitful.Towards the latter part of
January, 1809, Paine was very feeble.On the 18th he wrote and signed
his Will, in which he reaffirms his theistic faith.On February 1st
the Committee of Claims reported unfavorably on his memorial, while
recording, "That Mr.Paine rendered great and eminent services to the
United States during their struggle for liberty and independence cannot
be doubted by any person acquainted with his labours in the cause, and
attached to the principles of the contest."On February 25th he had some
fever, and a doctor was sent for.Ryder attributed the attack
to Paine's having stopped taking stimulants, and their resumption was
prescribed.About a fortnight later symptoms of dropsy appeared.Towards
the end of April Paine was removed to a house on the spot now occupied
by No.59 Grove Street, Madame Bonneville taking up her abode under
the same roof.The owner was William A. Thompson, once a law partner
of Aaron Burr, whose wife, _nee_ Maria Holdron, was a niece of Elihu
Palmer.The whole of the back part of the house (which was in a lot, no
street being then cut) was given up to Paine.*

     * The topographical facts were investigated by John Randel,
     Jr., Civil Engineer, at the request of David C. Valentine,
     Clerk of the Common Council, New York, his report being
     rendered April 6, 1864.Reports of neglect of Paine by Madame Bonneville have been credited by
some, but are unfounded She gave all the time she could to the sufferer,
and did her best for him.Willett Hicks sometimes called, and his
daughter (afterwards Mrs.Cheese-man) used to take Paine delicacies.The
only procurable nurse was a woman named Hedden, who combined piety and
artfulness.Paine's physician was the most distinguished in New York,
Dr.Romaine, but nurse Hedden managed to get into the house one
Dr.Manly, who turned out to be Cheetham's spy.Manly afterwards
contributed to Cheetham's book a lying letter, in which he claimed
to have been Paine's physician.It will be seen, however, by Madame
Bonneville's narrative to Cobbett, that Paine was under the care of
his friend.As Manly, assuming that he called as many did,
never saw Paine alone, he was unable to assert that Paine recanted, but
he converted the exclamations of the sufferer into prayers to Christ.*

     * Another claimant to have been Paine's physician has been
     cited.In 1876 (N. Y, Observer) Feb.Wickham
     reported from a late Dr.Matson Smith, of New Rochelle, that
     he had been Paine's physician, and witnessed his
     drunkenness.Unfortunately for Wickham he makes Smith say it
     was on his farm where Paine "spent his latter days."Paine
     was not on his farm for two years before his death.Smith
     could never have attended Paine unless in 1803, when he had
     a slight trouble with his hands,--the only illness he ever
     had at New Rochelle,--while the guest of a neighbor, who
     attests his sobriety.Smith is
     living, Mr.Albert Willcox, who writes me his recollection
     of what Smith told him of Paine.Neither drunkenness, nor
     any item of Wickham's report is mentioned.He said Paine
     was afraid of death, but could only have heard it.The god of wrath who ruled in New York a hundred years, through the
ministerial prerogatives, was guarded by a Cerberean legend.The
three alternatives of the heretic were, recantation, special judgment,
terrible death.Before Paine's arrival in America, the excitement on
his approach had tempted a canny Scot, Donald Fraser, to write an
anticipated "Recantation" for him, the title-page being cunningly
devised so as to imply that there had been an actual recantation.On his
arrival in New York, Paine found it necessary to call Fraser to account,
The Scotchman pleaded that he had vainly tried to earn a living as
fencing-master, preacher, and school-teacher, but had got eighty dollars
for writing the "Recantation."Paine said: "I am glad you found the
expedient a successful shift for your needy family; but write no more
concerning Thomas Paine.I am satisfied with your acknowledgment--try
something more worthy of a man."*

     * Dr.Francis' "Old New York," p.The second mouth of Cerberus was noisy throughout the land; revivalists
were describing in New Jersey how some "infidel" had been struck blind
in Virginia, and in Virginia how one was struck dumb in New Jersey.But here was the very head and front of what they called "infidelity,"
Thomas Paine, who ought to have gathered in his side a sheaf of
thunderbolts, preserved by more marvellous "providences" than any
sectarian saint.Out of one hundred and sixty carried to the guillotine
from his prison, he alone was saved, by the accident of a chalk mark
affixed to the wrong side of his cell door.On two ships he prepared
to return to America, but was prevented; one sank at sea, the other was
searched by the British for him particularly.And at the very moment
when New Rochelle disciples were calling down fire on his head,
Christopher Dederick tried vainly to answer the imprecation; within a
few feet of Paine, his gun only shattered the window at which the author
sat."Providence must be as bad as Thomas Paine," wrote the old deist.This amounted to a sort of contest like that of old between the
prophets of Baal and those of Jehovah.The deists were crying to their
antagonists: "Perchance he sleepeth."If Paine
was spared, what heretic need tremble?But he reached his threescore
years and ten in comfort; and the placard of Satan flying off with him
represented a last hope.Skepticism and rationalism were not understood by pious people a hundred
years ago.Renan thinks
he will have his legend in France modelled after Judas.But no educated
Christian conceives of a recantation or extraordinary death-bed for a
Darwin, a Parker, an Emerson.Brad-laugh had some fear that
he might be a posthumous victim of the "infidel's legend."In 1875, when
he was ill in St Luke's Hospital, New York, he desired me to question
the physicians and nurses, that I might, if necessary, testify to his
fearlessness and fidelity to his views in the presence of death.But he
has died without the "legend," whose decline dates from Paine's case;
that was its crucial challenge.The whole nation had recently been thrown into a wild excitement by
the fall of Alexander Hamilton in a duel with Aaron Burr.Hamilton's
world-liness had been notorious, but the clergymen (Bishop Moore and the
Presbyterian John Mason) reported his dying words of unctuous piety and
orthodoxy.John Mason, Paine said:

"Between you and your rival in communion ceremonies, Dr.Moore of the
Episcopal church, you have, in order to make yourselves appear of
some importance, reduced General Hamilton's character to that of a
feeble-minded man, who in going out of the world wanted a passport from
a priest.Which of you was first applied to for this purpose is a matter
of no consequence.The man, sir, who puts his trust and confidence in
God, that leads a just and moral life, and endeavors to do good, does
not trouble himself about priests when his hour of departure comes, nor
permit priests to trouble themselves about him."The words were widely commented on, and both sides looked forward,
almost as if to a prize-fight, to the hour when the man who had unmade
thrones, whether in earth or heaven, must face the King of Terrors.Since Michael and Satan had their legendary combat for the body of
Moses, there was nothing like it.In view of the pious raids on Paine's
death-bed, freethinkers have not been quite fair.To my own mind, some
respect is due to those humble fanatics, who really believed that Paine
was approaching eternal fires, and had a frantic desire to save him.*

     * Nor should it be forgotten that several liberal
     Christians, like Hicks, were friendly towards Paine at the
     close of his life, whereas his most malignant enemies were
     of his own "Painite" household, Carver and Cheetham.William Erving tells me that he remembers an English
     clergyman in New York, named Cunningham, who used to visit
     his (Erving's) father.He heard him say that Paine and he
     were friends; and that "the whole fault was that people
     hectored Paine, and made him say things he would never say
     to those who treated him as a gentleman."Paine had no fear of death; Madame Bonneville's narrative shows that his
fear was rather of living too long.But he had some such fear as that of
Voltaire when entering his house at Fernay after it began to lighten.He was not afraid of the lightning, he said, but of what the neighboring
priest would make of it should he be struck.Paine had some reason to
fear that the zealots who had placarded the devil flying away with him
might fulfil their prediction by body-snatching.His unwillingness to be
left alone, ascribed to superstitious terror, was due to efforts to
get a recantation from him, so determined that he dare not be without
witnesses.While living with Jarvis, two years
before, he desired him to bear witness that he maintained his theistic
convictions to the last.Jarvis merrily proposed that he should make a
sensation by a mock recantation, but the author said, "Tom Paine never
told a lie."When he knew that his illness was mortal he solemnly
reaffirmed these opinions in the presence of Madame Bonneville, Dr.Haskin, Captain Pelton, and Thomas Nixon.* The nurse
Hedden, if the Catholic Bishop of Boston (Fenwick) remembered accurately
thirty-seven years later, must have conspired to get him into the
patient's room, from which, of course, he was stormily expelled.But the
Bishop's story is so like a pious novelette that, in the absence of
any mention of his visit by Madame Bonneville, herself a Catholic, one
cannot be sure that the interview he waited so long to report did not
take place in some slumberous episcopal chamber in Boston.**

     * Sec the certificate of Nixon and Pelton to Cobbett (Vale,
     p.** Bishop Fenwick's narrative (U. S. Catholic Magazine,
     1846) is quoted in the N. Y. Observer\ September 27, 1877.(Extremes become friends when a freethinker is to be
     crucified.)It was rumored that Paine's adherents were keeping him under the
influence of liquor in order that he might not recant,--so convinced,
at heart, or enamoured of Calvinism was this martyr of Theism, who
had published his "Age of Reason" from the prison where he awaited the
guillotine.*

     * Engineer Randel (orthodox), in his topographical report to
     the Clerk of the City Council (1864), mentions that the
     "very worthy mechanic," Amasa Wordsworth, who saw Paine
     daily, told him "there was no truth in such report, and that
     Thomas Paine had declined saying anything on that subject
     [religion]."Francis, "clung to his
     infidelity to the last moment of his natural life."Francis (orthodox) heard that Paine yielded to King Alcohol,
     but says Cheetham wrote with "settled malignity," and
     suspects "sinister motives" in his "strictures on the fruits
     of unbelief in the degradation of the wretched Paine."Of what his principles had cost him Paine had near his end a reminder
that cut him to the heart.Albert Gallatin had remained his friend, but
his connections, the Fews and Nicholsons, had ignored the author they
once idolized.The woman for whom he had the deepest affection, in
America, had been Kitty Nicholson, now Mrs.Henry Adams, in his
biography of Gallatin, says: "When confined to his bed with his last
illness he [Paine] sent for Mrs.Few, who came to see him, and when they
parted she spoke some words of comfort and religious hope.Poor Paine
only turned his face to the wall, and kept silence."According to Rick-man, Sherwin, and Vale, Mr.Few came of their own accord, and "Mrs.Few expressed a wish to
renew their former friendship."Paine said to her, "very impressively,
'You have neglected me, and I beg that you will leave the room.'Few went into the garden and wept bitterly."I doubt this tradition
also, but it was cruelly tantalizing for his early friend, after
ignoring him six years, to return with Death.If, amid tortures of this kind, the annoyance of fanatics and the
"Painites" who came to watch them, and the paroxysms of pain, the
sufferer found relief in stimulants, the present writer can only reflect
with satisfaction that such resource existed.For some time no food
would stay on his stomach.In such weakness and helplessness he was for
a week or so almost as miserable as the Christian spies could desire,
and his truest friends were not sorrowful when the peace of death
approached.After the years in which the stories of Paine's wretched
end have been accumulating, now appears the testimony of the Catholic
lady,--persons who remember Madame Bonneville assure me that she was a
perfect lady,--that Paine's mind was active to the last, that shortly
before death he made a humorous retort to Dr.Romaine, that he died
after a tranquil night.Paine died at eight o'clock on the morning of June 8, 1809.Shortly
before, two clergymen had invaded his room, and so soon as they spoke
about his opinions Paine said: "Let me alone; good morning!"Madame
Bonneville asked if he was satisfied with the treatment he had received
in her house, and he said "Oh yes."These were the last words of Thomas
Paine.On June 10th Paine's friends assembled to look on his face for the last
time.Madame Bonneville took a rose from her breast and laid it on that
of her dead benefactor.His adherents were busy men, and mostly poor;
they could not undertake the then difficult journey (nearly twenty-five
miles) to the grave beyond New Rochelle.Of the _cortege_ that followed
Paine a contemptuous account was printed (Aug.7th) in the London
Packet:

"Extract of a letter dated June 20th, Philadelphia, written by a
gentleman lately returned from a tour: 'On my return from my journey,
when I arrived near Harlem, on York island, I met the funeral of Tom
Paine on the road.The followers were
two <DW64>s, the next a carriage with six drunken Irishmen, then a
riding chair with two men in it, one of whom was asleep, and then an
Irish Quaker on horseback.I stopped my sulkey to ask the Quaker what
funeral it was; he said it was Paine, and that his friends as well as
his enemies were all glad that he was gone, for he had tired his friends
out by his intemperance and frailties.I told him that Paine had done
a great deal of mischief in the world, and that, if there was any
purgatory, he certainly would have a good share of it before the devil
would let him go.The Quaker replied, he would sooner take his chance
with Paine than any man in New York, on that score.He then put his
horse on a trot, and left me.'"The funeral was going to West Chester; one of the vehicles contained
Madame Bonneville and her children; and the Quaker was not an Irishman.I have ascertained that a Quaker did follow Paine, and that it was
Willett Hicks.Hicks, who has left us his testimony that Paine was "a
good man, and an honest man," may have said that Paine's friends were
glad that he was gone, for it was only humane to so feel, but all
said about "intemperance and frailties" is doubtless a gloss of the
correspondent, like the "drunken Irishmen" substituted for Madame
Bonneville and her family.Could the gentleman of the sulky have appreciated the historic dignity
of that little _cortege_ he would have turned his horse's head and
followed it.Those two <DW64>s, travelling twenty-five miles on foot,
represented the homage of a race for whose deliverance Paine had pleaded
from his first essay written in America to his recent entreaty for
the President's intervention in behalf of the slaughtered <DW64>s of
Domingo.* One of those vehicles bore the wife of an oppressed French
author, and her sons, one of whom was to do gallant service to this
country in the War of 1812, the other to explore the unknown West.Behind the Quaker preacher, who would rather take his chance in the next
world with Paine than with any man in New York, was following invisibly
another of his family and name, who presently built up Hicksite
Quakerism, the real monument of Paine, to whom unfriendly Friends
refused a grave.* "On the last day men shall wear On their heads the dust,
     As ensign and as ornament Of their lowly trust."--Hafis.The grand people of America were not there, the clergy were not there;
but beside the <DW64>s stood the Quaker preacher and the French Catholic
woman.Madame Bonneville placed her son Benjamin--afterwards General in
the United States army--at one end of the grave, and standing herself at
the other end, cried, as the earth fell on the coffin: "Oh, Mr.Paine,
my son stands here as testimony of the gratitude of America, and I for
France!"No sooner was Paine dead than the ghoul sat gloating upon him.I found
in the Rush papers a letter from Cheetham (July 31st) to Benjamin Rush:
"Since Mr.Paine's arrival in this city from Washington, when on his way
you very properly avoided him, his life, keeping the lowest company,
has been an uninterrupted scene of filth, vulgarity, and drunkenness.As
to the reports, that on his deathbed he had something like compunctious
visitings of conscience with regard to his deistical writings and
opinions, they are altogether groundless.He resisted very angrily, and
with a sort of triumphant and obstinate pride, all attempts to draw him
from those doctrines.Much as you must have seen in the course of your
professional practice of everything that is offensive in the poorest
and most depraved of the species, perhaps you have met with nothing
excelling the miserable condition of Mr.It may indeed be said that he was totally neglected and
forgotten.Bournville (sic) a woman, I cannot say a Lady, whom
he brought with him from Paris, the wife of a Parisian of that name,
seemed desirous of hastening his death.He died at Greenwich, in a small
room he had hired in a very obscure house.He was hurried to his grave
with hardly an attending person.An ill-natured epitaph, written on him
in 1796, when it was supposed he was dead, incorrectly describes the
latter end of his life.He

     "Blasphemes the Almighty, lives in filth like a hog,
     Is abandoned in death and interr'd like a dog."The object of this letter was to obtain from Rush, for publication, some
abuse of Paine; but the answer honored Paine, save for his heresy, and
is quoted by freethinkers as a tribute.Within a year the grave opened for Cheetham also, and he sank into it
branded by the law as the slanderer of a woman's honor, and scourged by
the community as a traitor in public life.The day of Paine's death was a day of judgment.He had not been struck
blind or dumb; Satan had not carried him off; he had lived beyond
his threescore years and ten and died peacefully in his bed.The
self-appointed messengers of Zeus had managed to vex this Prometheus who
brought fire to men, but could not persuade him to whine for mercy,
nor did the predicted thunderbolts come.This immunity of Thomas Paine
brought the deity of dogma into a dilemma.It could be explained only
on the the theory of an apology made and accepted by the said deity.Plainly there had to be a recantation somewhere.Either Paine had to
recant or Dogma had to recant.The excitement was particularly strong among the Quakers, who regarded
Paine as an apostate Quaker, and perhaps felt compromised by his desire
to be buried among them.Willett Hicks told Gilbert Vale that he had
been beset by pleading questions."Did thee never hear him call on
Christ?""As for money," said Hicks, "I could have had any sum."There
was found, later on, a Quakeress, formerly a servant in the family of
Willett Hicks, not proof against such temptations.She pretended that
she was sent to carry some delicacy to Paine, and heard him cry "Lord
Jesus have mercy upon me"; she also heard him declare "if the Devil has
ever had any agency in any work he has had it in my writing that book
[the 'Age of Reason']."* Few souls are now so belated as to credit such
stories; but my readers may form some conception of the mental condition
of the community in which Paine died from the fact that such absurdities
were printed, believed, spread through the world.The Quaker servant
became a heroine, as the one divinely appointed witness of Tom Paine's
recantation.* "Life and Gospel Labors of Stephen Grellet."This
     "valuable young Friend," as Stephen Grellet calls her, had
     married a Quaker named Hinsdale.Grellet, a native of
     France, convert from Voltaire, led the anti-Hicksites, and
     was led by his partisanship to declare that Elias promised
     him to suppress his opinions!The cant of the time was that
     "deism might do to live by but not to die by."But it had
     been announced in Paine's obituaries that "some days
     previous to his demise he had an interview with some Quaker
     gentlemen on the subject [of burial in their graveyard] but
     as he declined a renunciation of his deistical opinions his
     anxious wishes were not complied with."But ten years later,
     when Hicks's deism was spreading, death-bed terrors seemed
     desirable, and Mary (Roscoe) Hinsdale, formerly Grellet's
     servant also, came forward to testify that the recantation
     refused by Paine to the "Quaker gentlemen," even for a much
     desired end, had been previously confided to her for no
     object at all!The story was published by one Charles
     Collins, a Quaker, who afterwards admitted to Gilbert Vale
     his doubts of its truth, adding "some of our friends believe
     she indulges in opiates."But in the end it was that same Mary that hastened the resurrection
of Thomas Paine.The controversy as to whether Mary was or was not a
calumniator; whether orthodoxy was so irresistible that Paine must needs
surrender at last to a servant-girl who told him she had thrown his book
into the fire; whether she was to be believed against her employer, who
declared she never saw Paine at all; all this kept Paine alive.Such boiling up from the abysses, of vulgar credulity, grotesque
superstition, such commanding illustrations of the Age of Unreason,
disgusted thoughtful Christians.*

     * The excitement of the time was well illustrated in a
     notable caricature by the brilliant artist John Wesley
     Jarvis.Paine is seen dead, his pillow "Common Sense," his
     hand holding a manuscript, "A rap on the knuckles for John
     Mason."On his arm is the label, "Answer to Bishop Watson."Under him is written: "A man who devoted his whole life to
     the attainment of two objects--rights of man and freedom of
     conscience--had his vote denied when living, and was denied
     a grave when dead!"The Catholic Father O'Brian (a
     notorious drunkard), with very red nose, kneels over Paine,
     exclaiming, "Oh you ugly drunken beast!"John
     Mason (Presbyterian) stamps on Paine, exclaiming, "Ah, Tom!thou 't get thy frying in hell; they 'll roast thee
     like a herring."They 'll put thee in the furnace hot,
     And on thee bar the door:
     How the devils all will laugh
     To hear thee burst and roar!"Livingston kicks at Paine's head, exclaiming,

     "How are the mighty fallen,
     Right fol-de-riddle-lol!"Bishop Hobart kicks the feet, tinging:
     "Right fol-de-rol, let's dance and sing,
     Tom is dead, God save the king--
     The infidel now low doth lie--
     Sing Hallelujah--hallelujah!"A Quaker turns away with a shovel, saying,
     "I 'll not bury thee."Such was the religion which was supposed by some to have won Paine's
heart at last, but which, when mirrored in the controversy over his
death, led to a tremendous reaction.The division in the Quaker Society
swiftly developed.In December, 1826, there was an afternoon meeting of
Quakers of a critical kind, some results of which led directly to the
separation.The chief speaker was Elias Hicks, but it is also recorded
that "Willet Hicks was there, and had a short testimony, which seemed to
be impressive on the meeting."He had stood in silence beside the grave
of the man whose chances in the next world he had rather take than those
of any man in New York; but now the silence is broken.*

     * Curiously enough, Mary (Roscoe) Hinsdale turned up again.She had broken down under the cross-examination of William
     Cobbett, but he had long been out of the country when the
     Quaker separation took place.Mary now reported that a
     distinguished member of the Hicksite Society, Mary Lock
     wood, had recanted in the same way as Paine.This being
     proved false, the hysterical Mary sank and remained in
     oblivion, from which she is recalled only by the Rev.Rip
     Van Winkle.It was the unique sentence on Paine to recant
     and yet be damned.This honor belies the indifference
     expressed in the rune taught children sixty years ago:

     "Poor Tom Paine!there he lies:
     Nobody laughs and nobody cries:
     Where he has gone or how he fares,
     Nobody knows and nobody cares!"I told Walt Whitman, himself partly a product of Hicksite Quakerism,
of the conclusion to which I had been steadily drawn, that Thomas Paine
rose again in Elias Hicks, and was in some sort the origin of our one
American religion.I said my visit was mainly to get his "testimony" on
the subject for my book, as he was born in Hicks' region, and mentions
in "Specimen Days" his acquaintance with Paine's friend, Colonel
Fellows.Walt said, for I took down his words at the time:

"In my childhood a great deal was said of Paine in our neighborhood, in
Long Island.My father, Walter Whitman, was rather favorable to Paine.I remember hearing Elias Hicks preach; and his look, slender figure,
earnestness, made an impression on me, though I was only about eleven.He is well represented in the bust there, one of my
treasures.I was a young man when I enjoyed the friendship of Col.Fellows,--then a constable of the courts; tall, with ruddy face,
blue eyes, snowy hair, and a fine voice; neat in dress, an old-school
gentleman, with a military air, who used to awe the crowd by his looks;
they used to call him 'Aristides.'I used to chat with him in Tammany
Hall.It was a time when, in religion, there was as yet no philosophical
middle-ground; people were very strong on one side or the other; there
was a good deal of lying, and the liars were often well paid for
their work.Paine and his principles made the great issue.Paine was
double-damnably lied about.Fellows was a man of perfect truth
and exactness; he assured me that the stories disparaging to Paine
personally were quite false.Paine was neither drunken nor filthy; he
drank as other people did, and was a high-minded gentleman.I incline to
think you right in supposing a connection between the Paine excitement
and the Hicksite movement.Paine left a deep, clear-cut impression on
the public mind.Fellows told me that while Paine was in New York
he had a much larger following than was generally supposed.After his
death a reaction in his favor appeared among many who had opposed him,
and this reaction became exceedingly strong between 1820 and 1830, when
the division among the Quakers developed.Probably William Cobbett's
conversion to Paine had something to do with it.Cobbett lived in the
neighborhood of Elias Hicks, in Long Island, and probably knew him.Hicks was a fair-minded man, and no doubt read Paine's books carefully
and honestly.I am very glad you are writing the Life of Paine.Paine was among the best and truest of men."Paine's risen soul went marching on in England also.The pretended
recantation proclaimed there was exploded by William Cobbett, and the
whole controversy over Paine's works renewed.One after another deist
was sent to prison for publishing Paine's works, the last being Richard
Carlile and his wife.In 1819, the year in which William Cobbett
carried Paine's bones to England, Richard Carlile and his wife, solely
for this offence, were sent to prison,--he for three years, with fine of
L1,500, she for two years, with fine of L500,* This was a suicidal
victory for bigotry.When these two came out of prison they found that
wealthy gentlemen had provided for them an establishment in Fleet
Street, where these books were thenceforth sold unmolested.Carlile's petition to the House of Commons awakened that body and the
whole country.When Richard Carlile entered prison it was as a captive
deist; when he came out the freethinkers of England were generally
atheists.* I have before me an old fly-leaf picture, issued by
     Carlile in the same year.It shows Paine in his chariot
     advancing against Superstition.Superstition is a snaky-
     haired demoness, with poison-cup in one hand and dagger in
     the other, surrounded by instruments of torture, and
     treading on a youth.Behind her are priests, with mask,
     crucifix, and dagger.Burning <DW19>s surround them with a
     cloud, behind which are worshippers around an idol, with a
     priest near by, upholding a crucifix before a man burning at
     the stake.Attended by fair genii, who uphold a banner
     inscribed, "Moral Rectitude."Paine advances, uplifting in
     one hand the mirror of Truth, in the other his "Age of
     Reason."There are ten stanzas describing the conflict,
     Superstition being described as holding

     "in vassalage a doating World,
     Till Paine and Reason burst upon the mind,
     And Truth and Deism their flag unfurled."Common sense and common justice were entering into religion as they were
entering into government.Such epithets as "atheism," "infidelity,"
were but labels of outlawry which the priesthood of all denominations
pronounced upon men who threatened their throne, precisely as "sedition"
was the label of outlawry fixed by Pitt on all hostility to George III.In England, atheism was an insurrection of justice against any deity
diabolical enough to establish the reign of terror in that country
or any deity worshipped by a church which imprisoned men for their
opinions.Paine was a theist, but he arose legitimately in his admirer
Shelley, who was punished for atheism.Knightly service was done by
Shelley in the struggle for the Englishman's right to read Paine.If
any enlightened religious man of to-day had to choose between the
godlessness of Shelley and the godliness that imprisoned good men for
their opinions, he would hardly select the latter.The genius of Paine
was in every word of Shelley's letter to Lord Ellenborough on the
punishment of Eaton for publishing the "Age of Reason."*

     * "Whence is any right derived, but that which power
     confers, for persecution?Eaton
     to your religion by embittering his existence?You might
     force him by torture to profess your tenets, but he could
     not believe them except you should make them credible, which
     perhaps exceeds your power.Do you think to please the God
     you worship by this exhibition of your zeal?If so the
     demon to whom some nations offer human hecatombs is less
     barbarous than the Deity of civilized society.... Does
     the Christian God, whom his followers eulogize as the deity
     of humility and peace--he, the regenerator of the world, the
     meek reformer--authorise one man to rise against another,
     and, because lictors are at his beck, to chain and torture
     him as an infidel?When the Apostles went abroad to convert
     the nations, were they enjoined to stab and poison all who
     disbelieved the divinity of Christ's mission?...The
     time is rapidly approaching--I hope that you, my Lord, may
     live to behold its arrival--when the Mahometan, the Jew, the
     Christian, the Deist, and the Atheist will live together in
     one community, equally sharing the benefits which arrive
     from its association, and united in the bonds of charity and
     brotherly love."In America "atheism" was never anything but the besom which again and
again has cleared the human mind of phantasms represented in outrages on
honest thinkers.In Paine's time the phantasm which was called Jehovah
represented a grossly ignorant interpretation of the Bible; the
revelation of its monstrous character, represented in the hatred,
slander, falsehood, meanness, and superstition, which Jarvis represented
as crows and vultures hovering near the preachers kicking Paine's dead
body, necessarily destroyed the phantasm, whose pretended power was
proved nothing more than that of certain men to injure a man who
out-reasoned them.Paine's fidelity to his unanswered argument was
fatal to the consecrated phantasm.It was confessed to be ruling without
reason, right, or humanity, like the King from whom "Common Sense,"
mainly, had freed America, and not by any "Grace of God" at all, but
through certain reverend Lord Norths and Lord Howes.Paine's peaceful
death, the benevolent distribution of his property by a will affirming
his Theism, represented a posthumous and potent conclusion to the "Age
of Reason."Paine had aimed to form in New York a Society for Religious Inquiry,
also a Society of Theophilan-thropy.The latter was formed, and his
posthumous works first began to appear, shortly after his death, in an
organ called _The Theophilanthropist_.But his movement was too cosmopolitan to be contained in any local
organization."Thomas Paine," said President Andrew Jackson to Judge
Hertell, "Thomas Paine needs no monument made by hands; he has erected
a monument in the hearts of all lovers of liberty."The like may be
said of his religion: Theophilanthropy, under a hundred translations and
forms, is now the fruitful branch of every religion and every sect.The
real cultivators of skepticism,--those who ascribe to deity biblical
barbarism, and the savagery of nature,--have had their day.The removal and mystery of Paine's bones appear like some page of Mosaic
mythology.* An English caricature pictured Cobbett seated on Paine's
coffin, in a boat named Rights of Man, rowed by <DW64> Slaves.* The bones of Thomas Paine were landed in Liverpool
     November 21, 1819.The monument contemplated by Cobbett was
     never raised.There was much parliamentary and municipal
     excitement.A Bolton town-crier was imprisoned nine weeks
     for proclaiming the arrival.In 1836 the bones passed with
     Cobbett's effects into the hands of a Receiver (West).The
     Lord Chancellor refusing to regard them as an asset, they
     were kept by an old day-laborer until 1844, when they passed
     to B. Tilley, 13 Bedford Square, London, a furniture dealer.In 1849 the empty coffin was in possession of J. Chennell,
     Guildford.The silver plate bore the inscription "Thomas
     Paine, died June 8, 1809, aged 72."R. Ainslie
     (Unitarian) told E. Truelove that he owned "the skull and
     the right hand of Thomas Paine," but evaded subsequent
     inquiries.Of
     Paine's gravestone the last fragment was preserved by his
     friends of the Bayeaux family, and framed on their wall.In
     November, 1839, the present marble monument at New Rochelle
     was erected.Francis] led me to pay a visit to
Cobbett at his country seat, within a couple of miles of the city, on
the island, on the very day that he had exhumed the bones of Paine, and
shipped them for England.I will here repeat the words which Cobbett
gave utterance to at the friendly interview our party had with him.'I
have just performed a duty, gentlemen, which has been too long delayed:
you have neglected too long the remains of Thomas Paine.I have done
myself the honor to disinter his bones.I have removed them from New
Rochelle.I have dug them up; they are now on their way to England.When
I myself return, I shall cause them to speak the common sense of
the great man; I shall gather together the people of Liverpool and
Manchester in one assembly with those of London, and those bones will
effect the reformation of England in Church and State.'"Badeau, of New Rochelle, remembers standing near Cobbett's workmen
while they were digging up the bones, about dawn.There is a legend that
Paine's little finger was left in America, a fable, perhaps, of his once
small movement, now stronger than the loins of the bigotry that refused
him a vote or a grave in the land he so greatly served.As to his bones,
no man knows the place of their rest to this day.His thoughts, untraceable like his dust, are blown about the world
which he held in his heart.For a hundred years no human being has been
born in the civilized world without some spiritual tincture from that
heart whose every pulse was for humanity, whose last beat broke a fetter
of fear, and fell on the throne of thrones.APPENDIX A. THE COBBETT PAPERS.In the autumn of 1792 William Cobbett arrived in America.Among the
papers preserved by the family of Thomas Jefferson is a letter from
Cobbett, enclosing an introduction from Mr.Short, U. S. Secretary
of Legation at Paris.In this letter, dated at Wilmington, Delaware,
November 2, 1792, the young Englishman writes: "Ambitious to become
the citizen of a free state I have left my native country, England, for
America.I bring with me youth, a small family, a few useful literary
talents, and that is all."Cobbett had been married in the same year, on February 5th, and visited
Paris, perhaps with an intention of remaining, but becoming disgusted
with the revolution he left for America.He had conceived a dislike of
the French revolutionary leaders, among whom he included Paine.He
thus became an easy victim of the libellous Life of Paine, by George
Chalmers, which had not been reprinted in America, and reproduced the
statements of that work in a brief biographical sketch published in
Philadelphia, 1796.In later life Cobbett became convinced that he had
been deceived into giving fresh currency to a tissue of slanders.In the very year of this publication, afterwards much lamented, Paine
published in Europe a work that filled Cobbett with admiration.This was
"The Decline and Fall of the English System of Finance," which predicted
the suspension of gold payments by the Bank of England that followed the
next year.The pamphlet became Cobbett's text-book, and his _Register_
was eloquent in Paine's praise, the more earnestly, he confessed,
because he had "been one of his most violent assailants.""Old age
having laid his hand upon this truly great man, this truly philosophical
politician, at his expiring flambeau I lighted my taper."A sketch of Thomas Paine and some related papers of Cobbett are
generously confided to me by his daughter, Eleanor Cobbett, through her
nephew, William Cobbett, Jr., of Woodlands, near Manchester, England.The public announcement (1818) by Cobbett, then in America, of his
intention to write a Life-of Paine, led to his negotiation with
Madame Bonneville, who, with her husband, resided in New York.Madame
Bonneville had been disposing of some of Paine's manuscripts, such as
that on "Freemasonry," and the reply to Bishop Watson, printed in
_The Theophilanthropist_ (1810).She had also been preparing, with her
husband's assistance, notes for a biography of Paine, because of the
"unjust efforts to tarnish the memory of Mr.Paine"; adding, "_Et
l'indignation ma fait prendre la plume_."Cobbett agreed to give her
a thousand dollars for the manuscript, which was to contain important
letters from and to eminent men.She stated (September 30, 1819)
her conditions, that it should be published in England, without any
addition, and separate from any other writings.I suppose it was one or
all of these conditions that caused the non-completion of the bargain.Cobbett re-wrote the whole thing, and it is now all in his writing
except a few passages by Madame Bonneville, which I indicate by
brackets, and two or three by his son, J. P. Cobbett.Although Madame
Bonneville gave some revision to Cobbett's manuscript, most of the
letters to be supplied are merely indicated.No trace of them exists
among the Cobbett papers.Soon afterward the Bonnevilles went to Paris,
where they kept a small book shop.His biography
in Michaud's Dictionary is annotated by the widow, and states that
in 1829 she had begun to edit for publication the Life and posthumous
papers of Thomas Paine.From this it would appear that she had retained
the manuscript, and the original letters.In 1833 Madame Bonneville
emigrated to St.Louis, where her son, the late General Bonneville,
lived.Her Catholicism became, I believe, devout with advancing years,
and to that cause, probably also to a fear of reviving the old scandal
Cheetham had raised, may be due the suppression of the papers, with
the result mentioned in the introduction to this work.Louis, October 30, 1846, at the age of 79.Probably William Cobbett
did not feel entitled to publish the manuscript obtained under such
conditions, or he might have waited for the important documents that
were never sent.The recollections are those of both M.
and Madame Bonneville.The reader will find no difficulty in making out
the parts that represent Madame's personal knowledge and reminiscences,
as Cobbett has preserved her speech in the first person, and, with
characteristic literary acumen, her expressions in such important
points.His manuscript is perfect, and I have little editing to do
beyond occasional correction of a date, supplying one or two letters
indicated, which I have found, and omitting a few letters, extracts,
etc., already printed in the body of this work, where unaccompanied by
any comment or addition from either Cobbett or the Bonnevilles.At the time when this Cobbett-Bonneville sketch was written New York was
still a provincial place.Nicolas Bonneville, as Irving describes him,
seated under trees at the Battery, absorbed in his classics, might have
been regarded with suspicion had it been known that his long separation
from his family was due to detention by the police.Madame Bonneville is
reserved on that point.The following incident, besides illustrating the
characters of Paine and Bonneville, may suggest a cause for the rigor
of Bonneville's surveillance.In 1797, while Paine and Bonneville were
editing the _Bien Informe_, a "suspect" sought asylum with them.This
was Count Barruel-Beauvert, an author whose writings alone had caused
his denunciation as a royalist.He had escaped from the Terror, and now
wandered back in disguise, a pauper Count, who knew well the magnanimity
of the two men whose protection he asked.He remained, as proof-reader,
in the Bonneville house for some time, safely; but when the conspiracy
of 18 Fructidor (September 4, 1797) exasperated the Republic against
royalists, the Count feared that he might be the means of compromising
his benefactors, and disappeared.When the royalist conspiracy against
Bonaparte was discovered, Barruel-Beauvert was again hunted, and
arrested (1802).His trial probably brought to the knowledge of the
police his former sojourn with Paine and Bonneville.Bonaparte sent by
Fouche a warning to Paine that the eye of the police was upon him,
and that "on the first complaint he would be sent to his own country,
America."Whether this, and the closer surveillance on Bonneville, were
connected with the Count, who also suffered for a time, or whether due
to their anti-slavery writings on Domingo, remains conjectural.Towards
the close of life Bonneville received a pension, which was continued to
his widow.So much even a monarchy with an established church could do
for a republican author, and a freethinker; for Bonneville had published
heresies like those of Paine.THOMAS PAINE, A SKETCH OF HIS LIFE AND CHARACTER.[More exactly than any other author Thomas Paine delineates every
Circumstantial Events, private or Public in his Writings; nevertheless,
since many pretended Histories of the Life of T. P. have been published,
tracing him back to the day of his]* birth, we shall shortly observe,
that, as was never denied by himself, he was born at Thetford, in the
County of Norfolk, England on the 29.January, in the year 1737; that
his father Joseph Paine was a stay-maker, and by religion a Quaker; that
his mother was the daughter of a country attorney, and that she belonged
to the Church of England; but, it appears, that she also afterwards
became a Quaker; for these parents both belonged to the Meeting in 1787,
as appears from a letter of the father to the son.* The bracketed words, Madame Bonneville's, are on a
     separate slip.An opening paragraph by Cobbett is crossed
     out by her pen: "The early years of the life of a Great Man
     are of little consequence to the world.Whether Paine made
     stays or gauged barrels before he became a public character,
     is of no more importance to us than whether he was swaddled
     with woollen or with linen.It is the man, in conjunction
     with those labours which have produced so much effect in the
     world, whom we are to follow and contemplate.Nevertheless,
     since many pretended histories of the life of Paine have
     been published, etc."The above-mentioned histories relate (and the correctness of the
statement has not been denied by him), that Paine was educated at the
free-school of Thetford; that he left it in 1752, when he was fifteen
years of age, and then worked for some time with his father: that in a
year afterwards, he went to London: that from London he went to Dover:
that about this time he was on the eve of becoming a sailor: that he
afterwards did embark on board a privateer: that, between the years 1759
and 1774 he was a stay maker, an excise officer, a grocer, and an usher
to a school; and that, during the period he was twice married, and
separated by mutual consent, from his second wife.*

     * The dates given by Cobbett from contemporary histories
     require revision by the light of the careful researches made
     by myself and others, as given at the beginning of this
     biography.In this year 1774 and in the month of September, Paine sailed from
England for Philadelphia, where he arrived safe; and now we begin his
history; for here we have him in connection with his literary labours.It being an essential part of our plan to let Thomas Paine speak in his
own words, and explain himself the reason for his actions, whenever
we find written papers in his own hand, though in incomplete notes or
fragments, we shall insert such, in order to enable the reader to judge
for himself, and to estimate the slightest circumstances._Sauvent d'un
grand dessin un mot nous fait juger_."A word often enables us to judge
of a great design.""I happened to come to America a few months before the breaking out of
hostilities.I found the disposition of the people such that they might
have been led by a thread and governed by a reed.Their suspicion was
quick and penetrating, but their attachment to Britain was obstinate,
and it was at that time a kind of treason to speak against it.They
disliked the Ministry, but they esteemed the Nation.Their idea of
grievance operated without resentment, and their single object was
reconciliation.Bad as I believed the Ministry to be, I never conceived
them capable of a measure so rash and wicked as the commencing of
hostilities; much less did I imagine the Nation would encourage it.I viewed the dispute as a kind of law-suit, in which I supposed the
parties would find a way either to decide or settle it.I had no
thoughts of independence or of arms.The world could not then have
persuaded me that I should be either a soldier or an author.If I had
any talents for either they were buried in me, and might ever have
continued so had not the necessity of the times dragged and driven them
into action.I had formed my plan of life, and conceiving myself happy
wished everybody else so.But when the country, into which I had just
set my foot, was set on fire about my ears, it was time to stir.It was
time for every man to stir."*

     * From Crisis vii., dated Philadelphia, November 21, 1778.His first intention at Philadelphia was to establish an Academy for
young ladies, who were to be taught many branches of learning then
little known in the education of young American ladies.But, in 1775, he
undertook the management of the Pennsylvania Magazine.About this time he published, in Bradford's journal, an essay on the
slavery, of the <DW64>s, which was universally well received; and also
stanzas on the death of General Wolfe.In 1776, January 10, he published Common Sense.In the same year he
joined the army as aid-de-camp to General Greene.Gordon, in his history
of the Independence of the United States (vol.78), says:
[Wanting]--Ramsay (Lond.Franklin preserved by Thomas Paine: [Wanting, but no doubt one
else-where given, in the Hall manuscripts]

When Washington had made his retreat from New York Thomas Paine
published the first number of the Crisis, which was read to every
corporal's guard in the camp.It revived the army, reunited the members
of the [New York] Convention, when despair had reduced them to nine in
number, while the militia were abandoning their standards and flying in
all directions.The success of the army at Trenton was, in some degree,
owing to this first number of the Crisis.In 1778 he discovered the
robberies of Silas Deane, an agent of the United States in France.He gave in his resignation as Secretary, which was accepted by the
Congress.In 1779 he was appointed-Clerk to the General Assembly of
Pennsylvania, which office he retained until 1780.In 1780 he departed
for France with Col.John Laurens, commissioned especially by the
Congress to the Court at Versailles to obtain the aid that was wanted.After his return from France he
received the following letter from Col.Laurens:

"Carolina, April 18, 1782.--I received the letter wherein you mention
my horse and trunk, (the latter of which was left at Providence).The misery which the former has suffered at different times, by
mismanagement, has greatly distressed me.He was wounded in service, and
I am much attached to him.If he can be of any service to you, I entreat
your acceptance of him, more especially if you will make use of him in
bringing you to a country (Carolina) where you will be received with
open arms, and all that affection and respect which our citizens are
anxious to testify to the author of Common Sense, and the Crisis.I wish you to regard this part of America (Carolina) as your
particular home--and everything that I can command in it to be in common
between us."On the 10th of April, 1783, the definitive treaty of peace was received
and published.Nathaniel Greene:

"Ashley-Rives (Carolina), Nov.18, 1782.--Many people wish to get you
into this country."I see you are determined to follow your genius and not your fortune.I have always been in hopes that Congress would have made some handsome
acknowledgement to you for past services.I must confess that I think
you have been shamefully neglected; and that America is indebted to few
characters more than to you.But as your passion leads to fame, and
not to wealth, your mortification will be the less.Your fame for
your writings, will be immortal.At present my expenses are great;
nevertheless, if you are not conveniently situated, I shall take a pride
and pleasure in contributing all in my power to render your situation
happy."'Then letter from his father.--"Dear Son, &c."The following letter from William Livingston (Trenton, 4 November, 1784)
will show that Thomas Paine was not only honored with the esteem of the
most famous persons, but that they were all convinced that he had been
useful to the country.**

At this time Thomas Paine was living with Colonel Kirk-bride,
Bordentown, where he remained till his departure for France.He had
bought a house [in], and five acres of marshy land over against,
Bordentown, near the Delaware, which overflowed it frequently.Congress gave an order for three thousand dollars, which Thomas Paine
received in the same month.He carried with him the model of
a bridge of his own invention and construction, which he submitted, in
a drawing, to the French Academy, by whom it was approved.From Paris he
went to London on the 3 September 1787; and in the same month he went
to Thetford, where he found his father was dead, from the small-pox; and
where he settled an allowance on his mother of 9 shillings a week.* This and the preceding letter supplied by the author.A part of 1788 he passed in Rotherham, in Yorkshire, where his bridge
was cast and erected, chiefly at the expense of the ingenious Mr.The experiment, however, cost Thomas Paine a considerable sum.When Burke published his _Reflexions on the French Revolution_, Thomas
Paine answered him in his First Part of the Rights of Man.In January,
1792, appeared the Second Part of the Rights of Man.The sale of the
Rights of Man was prodigious, amounting in the course of one year to
about a hundred thousand copies.In 1792 he was prosecuted for his Rights of Man by the Attorney General,
McDonald, and was defended by Mr.Erskine, and found guilty of libel.But he was now in France, and could not be brought up for judgment.Each district of France sent electors to the principal seat of the
Department, where the Deputies to the National Assembly were chosen.Two
Departments appointed Thomas Paine their Deputy, those of Oise and
of Pas de Calais, of which he accepted the latter.He received the
following letter from the President of the National Assembly, Herault de
Sechelles:

"To Thomas Paine:

"France calls you, Sir, to its bosom, to perform one of the most useful
and most honorable functions, that of contributing, by wise legislation,
to the happiness of a people, whose destinies interest all who think and
are united with the welfare of all who suffer in the world."It becomes the nation that has proclaimed the Rights of Many to desire
among her legislators him who first dared to estimate the consequences
of those Rights, and who has developed their principles with that
Common Senset which is the only genius inwardly felt by all men, and the
conception of which springs forth from nature and truth."The National Assembly gave you the title of Citizen, and had seen
with pleasure that its decree was sanctioned by the only legitimate
authority, that of the people, who had already claimed you, even before
you were nominated."Come, Sir, and enjoy in France the most interesting of scenes for an
observer and a philosopher,--that of a confiding and generous people
who, infamously betrayed for three years, and wishing at last to end the
struggle between slavery and liberty, between sincerity and perfidy, at
length arises in its resolute and gigantic force, gives up to the sword
of the law those guilty crowned things who betrayed them, resists the
barbarians whom they raised up to destroy the nation.Her citizens
turned soldiers, her territory into camp and fortress, she yet calls and
collects in congress the lights scattered through the universe.Men of
genius, the most capable for their wisdom and virtue, she now calls to
give to her people a government the most proper to insure their liberty
and happiness."The Electoral Assembly of the Department of Oise, anxious to be the
first to elect you, has been so fortunate as to insure to itself that
honour; and when many of my fellow citizens desired me to inform you of
your election, I remembered, with infinite pleasure, having seen you at
Mr.Jefferson's, and I congratulated myself on having had the pleasure
of knowing you."Herault,

"President of the National Assembly."before the National Convention Thomas Paine
at the Tribune, with the deputy Bancal for translator and interpreter,
gave his opinion, written, on the capital sentence on Louis:--That,
though a Deputy of the National Convention of France, he could not
forget, that, previous to his being that, he was a citizen of the United
States of America, which owed their liberty to Louis, and that gratitude
would not allow him to vote for the death of the benefactor of America.On the 21st of January, 1793, Louis XVI was beheaded in the Square of
Louis XV.Thomas Paine was named by the Assembly as one of the Committee of
Legislation, and, as he could not discuss article by article without the
aid of an interpreter, he drew out a plan of a constitution.**

     * Both missing.Possibly the second should be to Danton.The reign of terror began on the night of the 10th of March!793, when
the greatest number and the best part of the real friends to freedom had
retired [from the Convention].But, as the intention of the conspiracy
against the Assembly had been suspected, as the greatest part of the
Deputies they wished to sacrifice had been informed of the threatening
danger, as, moreover, a mutual fear [existed] of the cunning tyranny of
some usurper, the conspirators, alarmed, could not this night consummate
their horrible machinations.They therefore, for this time, confined
themselves to single degrees of accusation and arrestation against the
most valuable part of the National Convention.Robespiere had placed
himself at the head of a conspiring Common-Hall, which dared to dictate
_laws of blood_ and proscription to the Convention.All those whom he
could not make bend under a Dictatorship, which a certain number of
anti-revolutionists feigned to grant him, as a tool which they could
destroy at pleasure, were guilty of being suspected, and secretly
destined to disappear from among the living.Thomas Paine, as his marked
enemy and rival, by favour of the decree on the suspected was classed
among the suspected, and, as a foreigner, was imprisoned in the
Luxembourg in December 1793.|

From this document it will be seen, that, while in the prison, he was,
for a month, afflicted with an illness that deprived him of his memory.It was during this illness of Thomas Paine that the fall of Robespierre
took place.Monroe, who arrived at Paris some days afterwards, wrote
to Mr.Paine, assuring him of his friendship, as appears from the letter
to Washington.Fifteen days afterwards Thomas Paine received a letter
from Peter Whiteside.** In consequence of this letter Thomas Paine wrote
a memorial to Mr.Monroe now claimed Thomas Paine, and he
_came out of the prison on the 6th of November, 1794, after ten months
of imprisonment_.Monroe, who had cordially
offered him his house.In a short time after, the Convention called
him to take his seat in that Assembly; which he did, for the reasons he
alleges in his letter to Washington.The following two pieces Thomas Paine wrote while in Prison: "Essay on
Aristocracy.""Essay on the character of Robespierre."* This is the bitter letter of which when it appeared
     Cobbett had written such a scathing review.** The letter telling him of the allegations made by some
     against his American citizenship.Thomas Paine received the following letter from Madame Lafayette, whose
husband was then a prisoner of war in Austria:

"19 Brumaire, Paris.--I was this morning so much agitated by the kind
visit from Mr.Monroe, that I could hardly find words to speak; but,
however, I was, my dear Sir, desirous to tell you, that the news of your
being set at liberty, which I this morning learnt from General Kilmaine,
who arrived here at the same time with me, has given me a moment's
consolation in the midst of this abyss of misery, where I shall all my
life remain plunged.Kilmaine has told me that you recollected
me, and have taken great interest in my situation; for which I am
exceedingly grateful.Monroe, my congratulations upon your being
restored to each other, and the assurances of these sentiments from
her who is proud to proclaim them, and who well deserved the title of
citizen of that second country, though I have assuredly never failed,
nor shall ever fail, to the former."With all sincerity of my heart,

"N.On the 27 January, 1794, Thomas Paine published in Paris, the First Part
of the "Age of Reason."Seeing the state of things in America, Thomas Paine wrote a letter to
Gen.Monroe entreated him not to
send it, and, accordingly it was not sent to Washington; but it was
afterwards published.A few months after his going out of prison, he had a violent fever.Monroe showed him all possible kindness and attention.She provided him
with an excellent nurse, who had for him all the anxiety and assiduity
of a sister.She neglected nothing to afford him ease and comfort, when
he was totally unable to help himself.He was in the state of a helpless
child who has its face and hands washed by its mother.The surgeon was
the famous Dessault, who cured him of an abscess which he had in his
side.After the horrible 13 Brumaire, a friend of Thomas Paine being
very sick, he, who was in the house, went to bring his own excellent
nurse to take care of his sick friend: a fact of little account
in itself, but a sure evidence of ardent and active friendship and
kindness.The Convention being occupied with a discussion of the question of what
Constitution ought to be adopted, that of 1791 or that of 1793, Thomas
Paine made a speech (July 7, 1795) as a member of the [original]
Committee [on the Constitution] and Lanthenas translated it and read
it in the Tribune.This speech has been translated into English, and
published in London; but, the language of the author has been changed
by the two translations.It is now given as written by the author.In April, 1796, he wrote his _Decline and Fail of the British System of
Finance _; and, on the 30th of July of that year he sent his letter to
Washington off for America by Mr.-------- who sent it to Mr.Bache, a
newspaper printer of Philadelphia, to be published, and it was published
the same year.The name of the gentleman who conveyed the letter, and
who wrote the following to Thomas Paine, is not essential and therefore
we suppress it.We here insert a letter from Talleyrand, the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, to show that Thomas Paine was always active and attentive in
doing every thing which would be useful to America.Thomas Paine after he came out of prison and had reentered the
Convention wrote the following letter.The following is essentially connected with the foregoing: "Paris,
October 4, 1796."In October, 1796, Thomas Paine published the Second Fart of the Age of
Reason.Monroe departed from France, and soon after Thomas Paine
went to Havre de Grace, to embark for the United States.But, he did
not, upon inquiry, think it prudent to go, on account of the great
number of English vessels then cruizing in the Channel.He therefore
came back to Paris; but, while at Havre, wrote the following letter, 13
April 1797, to a friend at Paris.The following letter will not, we hope, seem indifferent to the reader:
"Dear Sir, I wrote to you etc."At this time it was that Thomas Paine took up his abode at Mr.Bonneville's, who had known him at the Minister Roland's, and as Mr.B.
spoke English, Thomas Paine addressed himself to him in a more familiar
and friendly manner than to any other persons of the society.It was a
reception of Hospitality which was here given to Thomas Paine for a
week or a fortnight; but, the visit lasted till 1802, when he and Mr.Bonneville parted,--alas never to meet again!All the first floor was
occupied as a printing office.The whole house was pretty well filled;
and Mr.Bonneville gave up his study, which was not a large one, and a
bed-chamber to Thomas Paine.He was always in his apartments excepting
at meal times.He then used to read the newspapers, from
which, though he understood but little of the French language when
spoken, he did not fail to collect all the material information relating
to politics, in which subject he took most delight.When he had his
morning's reading, he used to carry back the journals to Mr.Bonneville,
and they had a chat upon the topicks of the day.If he had a short jaunt to take, as for instance, to Puteaux just by
the bridge of Neuilly, where Mr.Skipwith lived, he always went on
foot, after suitable preparations for the journey in that way.I do not
believe he ever hired a coach to go out on pleasure during the whole of
his stay in Paris.He laughed at those who, depriving themselves of a
wholesome exercise, could make no other excuse for the want of it than
that they were able to take it whenever they pleased.If not writing he was busily employed on some mechanical
invention, or else entertaining his visitors.Not a day escaped without
his receiving many visits.Smith [Sir
Robert] came very often to see him.Many travellers also called on him;
and, often, having no other affair, talked to him only of his great
reputation and their admiration of his works.He treated such visitors
with civility, but with little ceremony, and, when their conversation
was mere chit-chat, and he found they had nothing particular to say to
him, he used to retire to his own pursuits, leaving them to entertain
themselves with their own ideas.Smith's [Sir Robert], and sometimes at an Irish Coffee-house
in Conde Street, where Irish, English, and American people met.He here
learnt the state of politics in England and America.He never went out
after dinner without first taking a nap, which was always of two or
three hours length.And, when he went out to a dinner of _parade_, he
often came home for the purpose of taking his accustomed sleep.It was
seldom he went into the society of French people; except when, by
seeing some one in office or power, he could obtain some favour for his
countrymen who might be in need of his good offices.These he always
performed with pleasure, and he never failed to adopt the most likely
means to secure success.He wrote as
follows to Lord Cornwallis; but, he did not save Napper Tandy.C. Jourdan made a report to the Convention on the re-establishment
of Bells, which had been suppressed, and, in great part melted.Paine
published, on this occasion, a letter to C.*

     * The words "which will find a place in the Appendix" are
     here crossed out by Madame Bonneville.258
     concerning Jourdan.He had brought with him from America, as we have seen, a model of a
bridge of his own construction and invention, which model had been
adopted in England for building bridges under his own direction.He
employed part of his time, while at our house, in bringing this model to
high perfection, and this accomplished to his wishes.He afterwards,
and according the model, made a bridge of lead, which he accomplished b/
moulding different blocks of lead, which, when joined together, made the
form that he required.Though
he fully relied on the strength of his new bridge, and would produce
arguments enough in proof of its infallible strength, he often
demonstrated the proof by blows of the sledge-hammer, not leaving anyone
in doubt on the subject.One night he took off the scaffold of his
bridge and seeing that it stood firm under the repeated strokes of
hammer, he was so ravished that an enjoyment so great was not to be
sufficiently felt if confined to his own bosom.He was not satisfied
without admirers of his success.One night we had just gone to bed, and
were surprised at hearing repeated strokes of the hammer.Bonneville's room and besought him to go and see his bridge:
come and look, said he, it bears all my blows and stands like a rock.Bonneville arose, as well to please himself by seeing a happy man as
to please him by looking at his bridge.Nothing would do, unless I saw
the sight as well as Mr.After much exultation: "nothing, in
the world," said he, "is so fine as my bridge"; and, seeing me standing
by without uttering a word, he added, "except a woman!"which happy
compliment to the sex he seemed to think, a full compensation for the
trouble caused by this nocturnal visit to the bridge.A machine for planing boards was his next invention, which machine he
had executed partly by one blacksmith and partly by another.The machine
being put together by him, he placed it on the floor, and with it planed
boards to any number that he required, to make some models of wheels.Bonneville has two of these wheels now.There is a specification
of the wheels, given by Mr.This specification, together
with a drawing of the model, made by Mr.Fulton, were deposited at
Washington, in February 1811; and the other documents necessary to
obtain a patent as an invention of Thomas Paine, for the benefit of
Madam Bonneville.To be presented to the Directory of France, a memorial
on the progress and construction of iron bridges.On this subject the
two pieces here subjoined will throw sufficient light.(Memoir upon
Bridges.--Upon Iron Bridges.--To the Directory.--Memoir on the Progress
and Construction &c.)Preparations were made, real or simulated, for a Descent upon England.8. who was then in the house of
Talma, and he wrote the following notes and instructions.Letter at
Brussells.--The Ca-ira of America.--To the Consul Lepeaux.*

     * This paragraph is in the writing of Madame Bonneville.means Bonaparte, and seems to be some cipher.All of the
     pieces by Paine mentioned are missing; also that addressed
     "To the Directory," for the answer to which see p.296 of
     this volume.Chancellor Livingston, after his arrival in France, came a few times to
see Paine.One morning we had him at breakfast, Dupuis, the author of
the Origin of Worship, being of the party; and Mr.Livingston, when he
got up to go away, said to Mr.Paine smiling, "Make your Will; leave
the mechanics, the iron bridge, the wheels, etc.to America, and your
religion to France."Thomas Paine, while at our house, published in Mr.Bonneville's journal
(the _Bien Informe_) several articles on passing events.*

     * The following words are here crossed out: "Also several
     pieces of poetry, which will be published hereafter, with
     his miscellaneous prose."A few days before his departure for America, he said, at Mr.Smith's
[Sir Robert] that he had nothing to detain him in France; for that he
was neither in love, debt, nor difficulty.Some lady observed, that it
was not, in the company of ladies, gallant to say he was not in love.Upon this occasion he wrote the New Covenant, from the Castle in the Air
to the Little Corner of the World, in three stanzas, and sent it with
the following words: "As the ladies are better judges of gallantry
than the men are, I will thank you to tell me, whether the enclosed be
gallantry.If it be, it is truly original; and the merit of it belongs
to the person who inspired it.""If the usual style of gallantry was as clever as your new
covenant, many a fair ladies heart would be in danger, but the Little
Corner of the World receives it from the Castle in the Air; it is
agreeable to her as being the elegant fancy of a friend.--C.At this time, 1802, public spirit was at end in France.The real
republicans were harrassed by eternal prosecutions.Paine was a truly
grateful man: his friendship was active and warm, and steady.During the
six years that he lived in our house, he frequently pressed us to go to
America, offering us all that he should be able to do for us, and saying
that he would bequeath his property to our children.Some affairs of
great consequence made it impracticable for Mr.Bonneville to quit
France; but, foreseeing a new revolution, that would strike, personally,
many of the Republicans, it was resolved, soon after the departure
of Mr.Paine for America, that I should go thither with my children,
relying fully on the good offices of Mr.Paine, whose conduct in America
justified that reliance.In 1802 Paine left France, regretted by all who knew him.He embarked
at Havre de Grace on board a stout ship, belonging to Mr.Patterson, of
Baltimore, he being the only passenger.After a very stormy passage, he
landed at Baltimore on the 30th of October, 1812.He remained there but
a few days, and then went to Washington, where he published his Letters
to the Americans.A few months afterwards, he went to Bordentown, to his friend Col.Kirkbride, who had invited him, on his return, by the following letter
of 12 November, 1802.He staid at Bordentown about two months, and then went to New York,
where a great number of patriots gave him a splendid dinner at the City
Hotel.In June, 1803, he went to Stonington, New England, to see some
friends; and in the autumn he went to his farm at New Rochelle.(The
letter of Thomas Paine to Mr.Bonneville, 20 Nov., 1803.)An inhabitant of this village offered him an apartment, of which he
accepted, and while here he was taken ill.His complaint was a sort of
paralytic affection, which took away the use of his hands.He had had
the same while at Mr.Monroe's in Paris, after he was released from
prison.Being better, he went to his farm, where he remained a part of
the winter, and he came to New York to spend the rest of it; but in the
spring (1804) he went back to his farm.The farmer who had had his farm
for 17 or 18 years, instead of paying his rent, brought Mr.Paine a bill
for fencing, which made Paine his debtor!They had a law-suit by which
Paine got nothing but the right of paying the law-expenses!This and
other necessary expenses compelled him to sell sixty acres of his land.He then gave the honest farmer notice to quit the next April (1805).Upon taking possession of the farm himself, he hired Christopher Derrick
to cultivate it for him.He soon found that Derrick was not fit for his
place, and he, therefore, discharged him.This was in the summer; and,
on Christmas Eve ensuing, about six o'clock, Mr.Paine being in his
room, on the ground floor, reading, a gun was fired a few yards from the
window.The contents of the gun struck the bottom part of the window,
and all the charge, which was of small shot, lodged, as was next day
discovered, in the window sill and wall.The shooter, in firing the gun,
fell; and the barrel of the gun had entered the ground where he fell,
and left an impression, which Thomas Paine observed the next morning.Thomas Paine went immediately to the house of a neighboring farmer, and
there (seeing a gun, he took hold of it, and perceived that the
muzzle of the gun was filled with fresh earth.)And then he heard that
Christopher Derick had borrowed the gun about five o'clock the evening
before, and had returned it again before six o'clock the same evening.Derick was arrested, and Purdy, his brother farmer, became immediately
and voluntarily his bail.The cause was brought forward at New Rochelle;
and Derick was acquitted.*

     * See p.Several paragraphs here are in
     the writing of J. P. Cobbett, then with his father in New
     York.In 1806 Thomas Paine offered to vote at New Rochelle for the election.But his vote was not admitted; on the pretence only of his not being
a citizen of America; whereon he wrote the following letters.[_The
letters are here missing, but no doubt the same as those on pp.379-80
of this volume_..]

This case was pleaded before the Supreme Court of New York by Mr.Riker, then Attorney General, and, though Paine lost his cause, I as
his legatee, did not lose the having to pay for it.It is however, an
undoubted fact, that Mr.He remained at New Rochelle till June 1807; till disgust of every kind,
occasioned by the gross and brutal conduct of some of the people there,
made him resolve to go and live at New York.On the 4th of April, 1807, he wrote the following letter to Mr.Bonneville [in Paris]:

"My dear Bonneville: Why don't you come to America Your wife and two
boys, Benjamin and Thomas, are here, and in good health.They all speak
English very well; but Thomas has forgot his French.I intend to provide
for the boys, but, I wish to see you here.We heard of you by letters by
Madget and Captain Hailey.Thomas, an English
woman, keep an academy for young ladies."I send this by a friend, Mrs.Champlin, who will call on Mercier at the
Institute, to know where you are.And some time after the following letter:

"My dear Bonneville: I received your letter by Mrs.Champlin, and also
the letter for Mrs.Bonneville, and one from her sister.I have written
to the American Minister in Paris, Mr.Armstrong, desiring him to
interest himself to have your surveillance taken off on condition of
your coming to join your family in the United States.Bonneville's, come to you under cover to the
American Minister from Mr.As soon as you
receive it I advise you to call on General Armstrong and inform him of
the proper method to have your surveillance taken off.Champagny,
who succeeds Talleyrand, is, I suppose, the same who was Minister of the
Interior, from whom I received a handsome friendly letter, respecting
the iron bridge.I think you once went with me to see him."Call on Mr Skipwith with my compliments.He will inform you what
vessels will sail for New York and where from.Bordeaux will be the best
place to sail from.Lee is American Consul at Bordeaux.When you arrive there, call on him, with my compliments.You may
contrive to arrive at New York in April or May.The passages, in the
Spring, are generally short; seldom more than five weeks, and often
less."Present my respects to Mercier, Bernardin St.Pierre, Dupuis,
Gregoire.--When you come, I intend publishing all my works, and those I
have yet in manuscript, by subscription."*

     * This letter is entirely in the writing of Madame
     Bonneville.Beneath it is written: "The above is a true
     copy of the original; I have compared the two together.The allusion to Champagny is either a
     slip of Madame's pen or Paine's memory.The minister who
     wrote him about his bridge was Chaptal.The
     names in the last paragraph show what an attractive literary
     circle Paine had left in France, for a country unable to
     appreciate him.While Paine was one day taking his usual after-dinner nap, an old woman
called, and, asking for Mr.Paine, said she had something of great
importance to communicate to him.She was shown into his bed-chamber;
and Paine, raising himself on his elbow, and turning towards the woman,
said: "What do you want with me?""I came," said she, "from God, to
tell you, that if you don't repent, and believe in Christ, you 'll be
dammed.""Poh, poh, it's not true," said Paine; "you are not sent with
such an impertinent message.God would not send
such a foolish ugly old woman as you.Get away;
be off: shut the door."After his arrival Paine published several articles in the newspapers of
New York and Philadelphia.Subsequent to a short illness which he had
in 1807, he could not walk without pain, and the difficulty of walking
increased every day.On the 21st of January, 1808, he addressed a
memorial to the Congress of the United States, asking remuneration for
his services; and, on the 14th of February, the same year, another on
the same subject.These documents and his letter to the Speaker are as
follows.*

     * "Are as follows" in Madame B.'s writing, after striking
     oat Cobbett's words, "will be found in the Appendix."The
     documents and letters are not given, but they are well
     known.The Committee of Claims, to which the memorial had been submitted,
passed the following resolution: "Resolved, that Thomas Paine has leave
to withdraw his memorial and the papers accompanying the same."He
was deeply grieved at this refusal; some have blamed him for exposing
himself to it.But, it should be recollected, that his expenses were
greatly augmented by his illness, and he saw his means daily diminish,
while he feared a total palsy; and while he expected to live to a
very great age, as his ancestors had before him.His money yielded no
interest, always having been unwilling to place money out in that way.He had made his will in 1807, during the short illness already noticed.But three months later, he assembled his friends, and read to them
another will; saying that he had believed such and such one to be his
friend, and that now having altered his belief in them, he had also
altered his will.From motives of the same kind, he, three months before
his death, made another will, which he sealed up and directed to me, and
gave it me to keep, observing to me, that I was more interested in it
than any body else.He wished to be buried in the Quaker burying ground, and sent for a
member of the committee [Willett Hicks] who lived in the neighborhood.The interview took place on the 19th of March, 1809.Paine said, when we
were looking out for another lodging, we had to put in order the affairs
of our present abode.This was precisely the case with him; all his
affairs were settled, and he had only to provide his burying-ground;
his father had been a Quaker, and he hoped they would not refuse him a
grave; "I will," added he, "pay for the digging of it."The committee of the Quakers refused to receive his body, at which
he seemed deeply moved, and observed to me, who was present at the
interview, that their refusal was foolish."You will," said I, "be
buried on your farm" "I have no objection to that," said he "but the
farm will be sold, and they will dig my bones up before they be half
rotten."Paine," I replied, "have confidence in your friends.I
assure you, that the place where you will be buried, shall never be
sold."He seemed satisfied; and never spoke upon this subject again.I
have been as good as my word.Last December (1818) the land of the farm having been divided between
my children, I gave fifty dollars to keep apart and to myself, the place
whereon the grave was.Paine, doubtless, considered me and my children as strangers in America.His affection for us was, at any rate, great and sincere.He anxiously
recommended us to the protection of Mr.Emmet, saying to him, "when I
am dead, Madam Bonneville will have no friend here."And a little time
after, obliged to draw money from the Bank, he said, with an air of
sorrow, "you will have nothing left."*

     * Paine's Will appoints Thomas Addis Emmet, Walter Morton
     (with $200 each), and Madame Bonneville executors; gives a
     small bequest to the widow of Elihu Palmer, and a
     considerable one to Rickman of London, who was to divide
     with Nicholas Bonneville proceeds of the sale of the North
     part of his farm.To Madame Bonneville went his manuscripts,
     movable effects, stock in the N. Y. Phoenix Insurance
     Company estimated at $1500, and money in hand.The South
     part of the New Rochelle farm, over 100 acres, were given
     Madame Bonneville in trust for her children, Benjamin and
     Thomas, "their education and maintenance, until they come to
     the age of twenty-one years, in order that she may bring them
     well up, give them good and useful learning, and instruct
     them in their duty to God, and the practice of morality."At
     majority they were to share and share alike in fee simple.He desires to be buried in the Quaker ground,--"my father
     belonged to that profession, and I was partly brought up in
     it,"--but if this is not permitted, to be buried on his
     farm."The place where I am to be buried to be a square of
     twelve feet, to be enclosed with rows of trees, and a stone
     or post and railed fence, with a head-stone with my name and
     age engraved upon it, author of "Common Sense."He confides
     Mrs.Bonneville and her children to the care of Emmet and
     Morton."Thus placing confidence in their friendship, I
     herewith take my final leave of them and of the world.I
     have lived an honest and useful life to mankind; my time
     has been spent in doing good; and I die in perfect
     composure and resignation to the will of my Creator God."The Will, dated January 18, opens with the words,
     "The last Will and Testament of me, the subscriber, Thomas
     Paine, reposing confidence in my Creator God, and in no
     other being, for I know of no other, and I believe in no
     other."Paine had died July 27th, 1808.William Fayel, to whom I am indebted for much
     information concerning the Bonnevilles in St.Louis, writes
     me that so little is known of Paine's benefactions, that
     "an ex-senator of the United States recently asserted that
     Gen.Bonneville was brought over by Jefferson and a French
     lady; and a French lady, who was intimate with the
     Bonnevilles, assured me that General Bonneville was sent to
     West Point by Lafayette."His strength and appetite daily
departed from him; and in the day-time only he was able, when not in
bed, to sit up in his arm-chair to read the newspapers, and sometimes
write.When he could no longer quit his bed, he made some one read the
newspapers to him.He wrote nothing for the
press after writing his last will, but he would converse, and took
great interest in politics.The vigour of his mind, which had always
so strongly characterized him, did not leave him to the last moment.He
never complained of his bodily sufferings, though they became excessive.The want of exercise alone was the cause of
his sufferings.Notwithstanding the great inconveniences he was obliged
to sustain during his illness, in a carman's house [Ryder's] in a small
village [Greenwich], without any bosom friend in whom he could repose
confidence, without any society he liked, he still did not complain of
his sufferings.I indeed, went regularly to see him twice a week;
but, he said to me one day: "I am here alone, for all these people are
nothing to me, day after day, week after week, month after month, and
you don't come to see me."[Albert] Gallatin, about this
time, I recollect his using these words: "_I am very sorry that I ever
returned to this country_."As he was thus situated and paying a high
price for his lodgings he expressed a wish to come to my house.This
must be a great inconvenience to me from the frequent visits to Mr.Thomas Paine; but, I, at last, consented; and hired a house in the
neighborhood, in May 1809, to which he was carried in an arm-chair,
after which he seemed calm and satisfied, and gave himself no trouble
about anything.He had no disease that required a Doctor, though
Dr.Romaine came to visit him twice a week.The swelling, which had
commenced at his feet, had now reached his body, and some one had been
so officious as to tell him that he ought to be tapped.I told him, that I did not know; but, that, unless
he was likely to derive great good from it, it should not be done.The
next [day] Doctor Romaine came and brought a physician with him, and
they resolved that the tapping need not take place.A very few days before his
death, Dr.Romame said to me, "I don't think he can live till night."Paine, hearing some one speak, opens his eyes, and said: "'T is
you Doctor: what news?"such an one is gone to France on such
business.""He will do nothing there," said Paine."Your belly
diminishes," said the Doctor."And yours augments," said Paine.* The sentence thus far is struck out by Madame Bonno he had
     not seen for a long while.He was overjoyed at seeing him;
     but, this person began to speak upon religion, and Paine
     turned his head on the other side, and remained silent, even
     to the adieu of the person.When he was near his end, two American clergymen came to see him, and
to talk with him on religious matters."Let me alone," said he; "good
morning."One of his friends
came to New York; a person for whom he had a great esteem, and whom
seeing his end fast approaching, I asked him, in presence of a friend,
if he felt satisfied with the treatment he had received at our house,
upon which he could only exclaim, O!He added other words, but
they were incoherent It was impossible for me not to exert myself to
the utmost in taking care of a person to whom I and my children owed
so much.He now appeared to have lost all kind of feeling.He spent
the night in tranquillity, and expired in the morning at eight o'clock,
after a short oppression, at my house in Greenwich, about two miles from
the city of New York.Jarvis, a Painter, who had formerly made a
portrait of him, moulded his head in plaster, from which a bust was
executed.He was, according to the American custom, deposited in a mahogany
coffin, with his name and age engraved on a silver-plate, put on the
coffin.His corpse was dressed in a shirt, a muslin gown tied at neck
and wrists with black ribbon, stockings, drawers; and a cap was put
under his head as a pillow.(He never slept in a night-cap.)Before the
coffin was placed on the carriage, I went to see him; and having a rose
in my bosom, I took it out, and placed on his breast.Death had not
disfigured him.Though very thin, his bones were not protuberant.He was
not wrinkled, and had lost very little hair.His voice was very strong even to his last moments.He often exclaimed,
oh, lord help me!He
groaned deeply, and when a question was put to him, calling him by his
name, he opened his eyes, as if waking from a dream.He never answered
the question, but asked one himself; as, what is it o'clock, &c.

On the ninth of June my son and I, and a few of Thomas Paine's friends,
set off with the corpse to New Rochelle, a place 22 miles from New York.It was my intention to have him buried in the Orchard of his own farm;
but the farmer who lived there at that time said, that Thomas Paine,
walking with him one day, said, pointing to another part of the land, he
was desirous of being buried there."Then," said I, "that shall be
the place of his burial."And, my instructions were accordingly put in
execution.The head-stone was put up about a week afterwards with the
following inscription: "Thomas Paine, Author of "Common Sense," died
the eighth of June, 1809, aged 72 years."According to his will, a wall
twelve feet square was erected round his tomb.Four trees have been
planted outside the wall, two weeping willows and two cypresses.Many
persons have taken away pieces of the tombstone and of the trees, in
memory of the deceased; foreigners especially have been eager to obtain
these memorials, some of which have been sent to England.* They have
been put in frames and preserved.Verses in honor of Paine have been
written on the head stone.The grave is situated at the angle of the
farm, by the entrance to it.This interment was a scene to affect and to wound any sensible heart.Contemplating who it was, what man it was, that we were committing to an
obscure grave on an open and disregarded bit of land, I could not help
feeling most acutely.Before the earth was thrown down upon the coffin,
I, placing myself at the east end of the grave, said to my son Benjamin,
"stand you there, at the other end, as a witness for grateful America."Looking round me, and beholding the small group of spectators, I
exclaimed, as the earth was tumbled into the grave, "Oh!My
son stands here as testimony of the gratitude of America, and I, for
France!"This was the funeral ceremony of this great politician and
philosopher!**

     * The breaking of the original gravestone has been
     traditionally ascribed to pious hatred.A fragment of it,
     now in New York, is sometimes shown at celebrations of
     Paine's birthday as a witness of the ferocity vented on
     Paine's grave.It is satisfactory to find another
     interpretation.** Paine's friends, as we have said, were too poor to leave
     their work in the city, which had refused Paine a grave.Robert Bolton, in his History of Westchester County,
     introduces Cheetham's slanders of Paine with the words: "as
     his own biographer remarks."But even Cheetham
     does not lie enough for Bolton, who says: "His [Paine's]
     body was brought up from New York in a hearse used for
     carrying the dead, to Potter's Field; a white man drove the
     vehicle, accompanied by a <DW64> to dig the grave."The whole
     Judas legend is in that allusion to Potter's Field.Such
     is history, where Paine is concerned!The eighty-eight acres of the north part were sold at 25 dollars an
acre.The half of the south (the share of Thomas de Bonneville) has been
sold for the total sum of 1425 dollars.The other part of the south,
which was left to Benjamin de Bonneville, has just (1819) been sold in
lots, reserving the spot in which Thomas Paine was buried, being a piece
of land 45 feet square._Thomas Paine's posthumous works_.He left the manuscript of his answer
to Bishop Watson; the Third Part of his Age of Reason; several pieces
on Religious subjects, prose and verse.The great part of his posthumous
political works will be found in the Appendix.Some correspondences
cannot be, as yet, published.*

In _Mechanics_ he has left two models of wheels for carriages, and of
a machine to plane boards.Of the two models of bridges, left at the
Philadelphia Museum, only one has been preserved, and that in great
disorder, one side being taken entirely off.But, I must say here, that
it was then out of the hands of Mr.Though it is difficult, at present, to make some people believe that,
instead of being looked on as a deist and a drunkard, Paine ought to be
viewed as a philosopher and a truly benevolent man, future generations
will make amends for the errors of their forefathers, by regarding
him as a most worthy man, and by estimating his talents and character
according to their real worth.Thomas Paine was about five feet nine inches high, English measure, and
about five feet six French measure.His bust was well proportioned;
and his face oblong.Reflexion was the great expression of his face;
in which was always seen the calm proceeding from a conscience void of
reproach.His eye, which was black, was lively and piercing, and told
us that he saw into the very heart of hearts [of any one who wished to
deceive him].***

     * All except the first two MSS., of which fragments exist,
     and some poems, were no doubt consumed at St.Louis, as
     stated in the Introduction to this work.** I have vainly searched in Philadelphia for some relic of
     Paine's bridges.In this paragraph and some
     that follow the hand of Nicolas Bonneville is, I think,
     discernible.A most benignant smile expressed what he felt upon receiving an
affectionate salutation, or praise delicately conveyed.His leg and
foot were elegant, and he stood and walked upright, without stiffness or
affectation.[He never wore a sword nor cane], but often walked with
his hat in one hand and with his other hand behind his back.His
countenance, when walking, was generally thoughtful.In receiving
salutations he bowed very gracefully, and, if from an acquaintance, he
did not begin with "how d' ye do?"If they had
none, he gave them his.His beard, his lips, his head, the motion of his
eye-brow, all aided in developing his mind.Was he where he got at the English or American newspapers, he hastened
to over-run them all, like those who read to make extracts for their
paper.His first glance was for the funds, which, in spite of
jobbing and the tricks of government, he always looked on as the
sure thermometer of public affairs.Parliamentary Debates, the Bills,
concealing a true or sham opposition of such or such orators, the secret
pay and violent theatrical declamation, or the revelations of public or
private meetings at the taverns; these interested him so much that he
longed for an ear and a heart to pour forth all his soul.When he
added that he knew the Republican or the hypocrite, he would affirm,
beforehand, that such or such a bill, such or such a measure, would
take place; and very seldom, in such a case, the cunning politic or the
clear-sighted observer was mistaken in his assertions; for they were not
for him mere conjectures.He spoke of a future event as of a thing past
and consummated.In a country where the slightest steps are expanded to
open day, where the feeblest connexions are known from their beginning,
and with all the views of ambition, of interest or rivalship, it is
almost impossible to escape the eye of such an observer as Thomas Paine,
whom no private interest could blind or bewitch, as was said by the
clear-sighted Michael Montaigne.His writings are generally perspicuous and full of light, and often they
discover the sardonic and sharp smile of Voltaire.One may see that he
wishes to wound to the quick; and that he hugs himself in his success.But Voltaire all at once overruns an immense space and resumes his
vehement and dramatic step: Paine stops you, and points to the place
where you ought to smile with him at the ingenious traits; a gift to
envy and stupidity.Thomas Paine did not like to be questioned.He used to say, that he
thought nothing more impertinent, than to say to any body: "What do
you think of that?"On his arrival at New York, he went to see General
Gates.After the usual words of salutation, the General said: "I have
always had it in mind, if I ever saw you again, to ask you whether you
were married, as people have said."Paine not answering, the General
went on: "Tell me how it is.""I never," said Paine, "answer impertinent
questions."Seemingly insensible and hard to himself, he was not so to the just
wailings of the unhappy.Without any vehement expression of his sorrow,
you might see him calling up all his powers, walking silently, thinking
of the best means of consoling the unfortunate applicant; and never did
they go from him without some rays of hope.And as his will was firm and
settled, his efforts were always successful.The man hardened in vice
and in courts [of law], yields more easily than one imagines to the
manly entreaties of a disinterested benefactor.* At this point are the words: "Barlow's letter [i. e. to
     Cheetham] we agreed to suppress."Thomas Paine loved his friends with sincere and tender affection.His simplicity of heart and that happy kind of openness, or rather,
carelessness, which charms our hearts in reading the fables of the good
Lafontaine, made him extremely amiable.If little children were near him
he patted them, searched his pockets for the store of cakes, biscuits,
sugarplums, pieces of sugar, of which he used to take possession as of
a treasure belonging to them, and the distribution of which belonged to
him.* His conversation was unaffectedly simple and frank; his language
natural; always abounding in curious anecdotes.He justly and fully
seized the characters of all those of whom he related any singular
traits.For his conversation was satyrick, instructive, full of
witticisms.If he related an anecdote a second time, it was always in
the same words and the same tone, like a comic actor who knows the place
where he is to be applauded.He neither cut the tale short nor told it
too circumstantially.It was real conversation, enlivened by digressions
well brought in.The vivacity of his mind, and the numerous scenes
of which he had been a spectator, or in which he had been an actor,
rendered his narrations the more animated, his conversation more
endearing.Politics were his favorite subject
He never spoke on religious subjects, unless pressed to it, and never
disputed about such matters.He could not speak French: he could
understand it tolerably well when spoken to him, and he understood it
when on paper perfectly well.He never went to the theatre: never spoke
on dramatic subjects.He did
not like it: he said it was not a serious thing, but a sport of the
mind, which often had not common sense.His common reading was the
affairs of the day; not a single newspaper escaped him; not a political
discussion: he knew how to strike while the iron was hot; and, as he
was always on the watch, he was always ready to write.Hence all his
pamphlets have been popular and powerful.He wrote with composure and
steadiness, as if under the guidance of a tutelary genius.If, for an
instant, he stopped, it was always in the attitude of a man who
listens.The Saint Jerome of Raphael would give a perfect idea of his
contemplative recollection, to listen to the voice from on high which
makes itself heard in the heart.[It will be proper, I believe, to say here, that shortly after the Death
of Thomas Paine a book appeared, under the Title of: The Life of Thomas
Paine, by Cheethatn.In this libel my character was calumniated.I cited
the Author before the Criminal Court of New York, He was tried and in
spite of all his manoeuvres, he was found guilty.--M.This last paragraph, in brackets, is in the writing of Madame
Bonneville.Robert Waters, of Jersey City, a biographer
of Cobbett, for the suggestion, made through a friend, and so amply
justified, that information concerning Paine might be derived from the
Cobbett papers.APPENDIX B. THE HALL MANUSCRIPTS

In 1785, John Hall, an able mechanician and admirable man, emigrated
from Leicester, England, to Philadelphia, He carried letters to Paine,
who found him a man after his own heart I am indebted to his relatives,
Dr.Dutton Steele of Philadelphia and the Misses Steele, for Hall's
journals, which extend over many years.It will be seen that the papers
are of historical importance apart from their records concerning Paine.Hall's entries of his daily intercourse with Paine, which he never
dreamed would see the light, represent a portraiture such as has rarely
been secured of any character in history.The extent already reached by
this work compels me to omit much that would impress the reader with the
excellent work of John Hall himself, who largely advanced ironwork in
New Jersey, and whose grave at Flemmington, surrounded by those of the
relatives that followed him, and near the library and workshop he left,
merits a noble monument."I went a day or two past with the Captain and his lady to see the
exhibition of patriotic paintings.Paine the author of Common Sense is
amongst them.He went from England (had been usher to a school) on board
the same vessel that our Captain [Coltman] went in last time; their
acquaintance then commenced and has continued ever since.He resides
now in Bordentown in the Jerseys, and it is probable that I may see him
before it be long as when he comes to town the Captain says he is
sure to call on him.It is supposed the various States have made his
circumstances easy--General Washington, said if they did not provide for
him he would himself.I think his services were as useful as the sword."Pain by his Boy, informing us
of his coming this day.Kerbright

visitors Franklin, Gouverneur Morris, Dr.Rush, Tench Francis, Robert
Morris, Rittenhouse, Redman.A rubber of whist in which Paine won is
mentioned.]Franklin today;

suppose him to be at and no tidings of him.We became very unhappy
fearing his political enemies should have shown him foul play.Went to
bed at 10 o.c, and about 2 o.c.Before 7 o'c a brother saint-maker came with a model of
machine to drive boats against stream.* He had communicated his scheme
to H. who had made alterations and a company had taken it and refused
saint-maker partnership.He would fain have given it to Mr.Paine or me,
but I a stranger refused and Mr.Paine had enough hobbys of his own.Paine pointed out a mode to simplify his apparatus greatly.This saint-maker is John
     Fitch, the "H."This entry is of
     much interest.The first steamer seems
     to have gone begging!Paine asked me to go and see Indian Chiefs of Sennaka
Nation, I gladly assented.Paine wished
to see him and made himself known to him by past remembrance as Common

and shook hands cordially Mr.Colonel Kirkbride is the gentleman in whose
family I am.My patron [Paine] is likewise a boarder and makes his home

elsewhere, for what I see.In this town is a Quaker meeting and one of
another class--I suppose of the Baptist cast--And a person in town a

places, as most necessary, or I suppose advantageous, to himself; for by
one trade or the other he has built himself a very elegant frame house
in this town.This man's way to Heaven is somewhat different to the
other.I am informed he makes publick dippings &c. My Employer has
_Common Sense enough_ to disbelieve most of the Common Systematic
Theories of Divinity but does not seem to establish any for himself.The
Colonel [Kirkbride] is as Free as John Coltman.[Under date of New York, July 31st, Hall writes an account of a journey
with Paine to Morrisania, to visit Gen.Morris, and afterwards to the
farm at New Rochelle, of which he gives particulars already known to my
reader.]Letter of Paine to John Hall, at Capt.Coltman's, in Letitia Court,
Market St, between Front and Second St.Philadelphia:

"Bordentown, Sep.22, 1786.--Old Friend: In the first place I have
settled with Mr.Gordon for the time he has been in the house--in the
second I have put Mrs.Read who, you know has part of our house Col.Kirkbride's but is at this time at Lancaster, in possession by putting
part of her goods into it.* By this means we shall have room at our
house (Col.Kirkbride) for carrying on our operations.As Philadelphia
is so injurious to your health and as apartments at Wm.Foulke's would
not be convenient to you, we can now conveniently make room for you
here.Kirkbride mentioned this to me herself and it is by the
choice of both her and Col.I wish you could
come up to-morrow (Sunday) and bring the iron with you.I shall be
backward and forward between here and Philadelphia pretty often until
the elections are over, but we can make a beginning here and what more
iron we may want we can get at the Delaware Works, and if you should
want to go to Mount hope you can more conveniently go from here than
from Philadelphia--thus you see I have done your business since I
have been up.Henry who is member for

with Col.K. who will very freely give any information in his power.servt"

Undated letter of Paine to John Hall, in Philadelphia:

"Fryday Noon.--Old Friend: Inclosed (as the man said by the horse) I
send you the battau, as I wish to present it as neat and clean as can be
done; I commit it to your care.The sooner it is got on Board the vessel
the better.I shall set off from here on Monday and expect to be in New
York on Tuesday.I shall take all the tools that are here with me and
wish you would take some with you, that if we should get on a working
fit we may have some to work with.Let me hear from you by the Sunday's
boat and send me the name of the vessel and Captain you go with and what
owners they belong to at New York, or what merchants they go to.I wrote
to you by the last boat, and Peter tells me he gave the letter to Capt.Haines, but Joe says that he enquired for letters and was told there was
none--wishing you an agreeable voyage and meeting at New York, I am your
friend, and humble servant.Kirkbride's and Polly's compt."3 (1786) "Dashwood Park, of Captain Roberts: On
Thursday morning early Sept.28th I took the stage wagon for Trenton.Jo
had gone up by water the day before to a sale of land and a very capital
iron works and nailing with a large corn mill.It was a fair sale there
was a forge and rolling and slitting mill upon an extensive scale the
man has failed--The works with about 60 or 70 acres of land were sold
for L9000 currency.Then was put up about 400 acres of land and sold for
L2700 currency and I believe a good bargain; and bought by a friend of
mine called Common Sense--Who I believe had no idea of purchasing it
when he came there.He took Jo to Bordentown with him that night and
they came to look at it the next day; then Jo went into the Jerseys
to find a countryman named Burges but was disappointed Came back to
Bordentown and on Saturday looked all over Mr.Paine's purchase along
with him and believes it bought well worth money.Paine told us an anecdote of a French noble's applying to
Dr.Franklin, as the Americans had put away their King, and that nation
having formerly chosen a King from Normandy, he offered his service and
wished him to lay his letter before Congress.Paine observed that
Britain is the most expensive government in the world.She gives a King
a million a year and falls down and worships him.Last night he brought me in my room a pair of warm cloth
overshoes as feel very comfortable this morning Had a wooden pot stove
stand betwixt my feet by Mr.Paine's desire and found it kept my feet
warm.As soon as breakfast was over mounted Button [Paine's
horse] and set off for Philadelphia.Paine $120 in gold
and silver.Day was devoted to rivetting the bars, and
punching the upper bar for the bannisters [of the bridge].Kirkbride
and Polly went to hear a David Jones preach a rhodomontade sermon about
the Devil, Mary Magdalen, and against deists, etc.This day employed in raising and putting on the abutments
again and fitting them.The smith made the nuts of screws to go easier.Then set the ribs at proper distance, and after dinner I and Jackaway [?
]put on some temporary pieces on the frame of wood to hold it straight,
and when Mr.Pain came they then tied it on its wooden frame with strong
cords.I then saw that it had bulged full on one side and hollow on the
other.I told him of it, and he said it was done by me--I denied that
and words rose high.I at length swore by God that it was straight when
I left it, he replied as positively the contrary, and I think myself ill
used in this affair.We arrived
in town about 5 o.clock took our bags to Capt Coltmans, and then went
down to Dr.Franklin's, and helped unload the bridge.Paine called
on me; gave us an anecdote of Dr.Paine asking him of
the value of any new European publication; he had not been informed of
any of importance.There were some religious posthumous anecdotes of
Doctor Johnson, of resolves he had made and broken though he had prayed
for power and strength to keep them; which showed the Doctor said that
he had not much interest there.And such things had better be suppressed
as nobody had anything to do betwixt God and man.Went with Glentworth to see the Bridge at Dr.Rittenhouse; returned with them
and helped move it for all three to stand upon, and then turned it to
examine.Rittenhouse has no doubt of its strength and sufficiency
for the Schuylkill, but wished to know what quantity of iron [it would
require,] as he seemed to think it too expensive.The Bank bill called but postponed
until tomorrow.Pain's letter read, and leave given to exhibit the
Bridge at the State House to be viewed by the members.Pain, who told me Donnalson had been to see and [stand]
upon his Bridge, and admitted its strength and powers.Then took a walk
beyond Vine street, and passed by the shop where the steamboat apparatus
is.Pain at our house, and talking on the Bank affair brought on a
dispute between Mr.Pain and the Captain [Coltman] in which words were
very high.A reflection from Captain C. on publications in favour of the
Bank having lost them considerable, he [Paine] instantly took that as a
reflection on himself, and swore by G--d, let who would, it was a lie.I then left the room and went up stairs.They quarrelled a considerable
time, but at length parted tolerably coolly.Dinner being ready I went
down; but the Captain continued talking about politics and the Bank, and
what he thought the misconduct of Mr.Pain in his being out and in with
the several parties.Pain in some things
relating thereto, by saying it was good sense in changing his ground
when any party was going wrong,--and that he seemed to delight in
difficulties, in Mechanics particularly, and was pleased in them.The
Captain grew warm, and said he knew now he could not eat his dinner.[Here followed a sharp personal quarrel between Hall and Coltman.]Paine came in and wished me to be assisting in carrying
the model to the State House.Franklin's and fetched the
Bridge to the Committee Room.Our Saint I have assisted in moving to the State House and
there placed in their Committee room, as by a letter addressed to this
Speaker they admitted.And by the desire of my patron (who is not an
early riser) I attended to give any information to inquiries until
he came.And then I was present when the Assembly with their Speaker
inspected it and many other persons as philosophers, Mechanics Statesmen
and even Tailors.I observed their sentiments and opinions of it were as
different as their features.The philosopher said it would add new
light to the great utility.And the tailor (for it is an absolute truth)
remarked it cut a pretty figure.It is yet to be laid (or by the by
stand) before the Council of State.Then the Philosophical Society and
all the other Learned Bodies in this city.And then to be canonised by
an Act of State which is solicited to incorporate a body of men to adopt
and realise or Brobdinag this our Lilliputian handywork, that is now 13
feet long on a Scale of one to 24.And then will be added another to the
world's present Wonders.Pain called in and left me the intended Act of Assembly
for a Bridge Company, who are to subscribe $33,330 50/99 then are to
be put in possession of the present Bridge and premises to answer the
interest of their money until they erect a new one; and after they have
erected a new one, and the money arising from it amounts to more
than pays interest, it is to become a fund to pay off the principal
stockholders, and then the Bridge to become free.Pain called in;
I gave him my Bill--told him I had charged one day's work and a pair of
gloves.Paine's boy called on time to [inquire] of the money
spent.Paine called this evening; told me of his being with Dr.Franklin and about the chess player, or Automaton, and that the Dr.Paine has had several
visitors, as Mr.Logan, &c.

Sunday April 16th Prepared to attend Mr.Paine's horse and chair came, mounted and drove through a barren sandy
country arrived at Bordentown at half past one-o'clock for dinner.This
is the pleasantest situation I have seen in this country.Sitting in the house saw a chair pass down the street
with a red coat on, and going out after it believed it to be Mr.Paine,
so followed him up to Collins's, where he was enquiring where I boarded.I just then called to him, and went with him to Whight's Tavern, and
there he paid me the money I had laid down for him.He is now going
for England by way of France in the French packet which sails the 25th
instant.He asked me to take a ride, and as the stage was not come in
and he going the road I gladly took the opportunity, as I could return
on meeting the stage.On the journey he told me of the Committee's
proceedings on Bridges and Sewers; anecdotes of Dr.Franklin, who had
sent a letter by him to the president, or some person, to communicate to
the Society of Civil Architects, who superintend solely over bridges in
France.The model is packed up to go with him.The Doctor, though full
of employ from the Vice President being ill, and the numerous visitors
on State business, and others that his fame justly procures him,
could hardly be supposed to pay great attention to trifles; but as he
considers Mr.Paine his adopted political Son he would endeavor to
write by him to his friends, though Mr.Paine did not press, for reasons
above.In 2 or 3 days he sent him up to Bordentown no less than a dozen
letters to his acquaintance in France.--He told me many anecdotes of the
Doctor, relating to national and political concerns, and observations of
many aged and sensible men of his acquaintance in that country.And the
treaty that he the Doctor made with the late King of Prussia by adding
an article that, should war ever break out, (though never a probability
of it) Commerce should be left free.The Doctor said he showed it to the
French minister, Vergennes, who said it met his idea, and was such as he
would make even with England, though he knew they would not,--they were
so fond of robbing and plundering.And the Doctor had gathered a hint
from a Du Quesney that no nation could properly expect to gain by
endeavoring to suppress his neighbor, for riches were to be gained from
amongst the rich and not from poor neighbors; and a National reciprocity
was as much necessary as a domestic one, or [inter] national trade as
necessary to be free as amongst the people of a country.Such and many
more hints passed in riding 2 or 3 miles, until we met the stage.I then
shook hands and wished him a good voyage and parted.Letter from Flemmington, N. J., May 16, 1788, to John Coltman,
Leicester, England:

"Friend John: Tell that disbelieving sceptical Infidel thy Father that
he has wounded my honor, What!Bought the Coat at a rag shop--does he
think I would palm such a falsity both upon Gray and Green heads!did
not I send you word it was General Washington's.And does he think I
shall slanderously brook such a slanderous indignity--No!I tell him
the first Ink that meanders from my pen, which shall be instantly on my
setting foot on Brittains Isle, shall be to call him to account.I 'll
haul out his Callous Leaden soul with its brother!"In the late revolution the provincial army lying near Princeton New
Jersey one Sunday General Washington and Common Sense each in their
chairs rode down there to Meeting Common Sense put up his at a friend's
one Mrs.Morgan's and pulling off his great coat put it in the care of
a servant man, and as I remember he was of the pure Irish Extraction;
he walked then to meeting and then slipped off with said great coat and
some plate of Mr.On their return they found what had been done
in their absence and relating it to the General his answer was it was
necessary to watch as well as pray--but told him he had two and would
lend or give him one--and that is the Coat I sent and the fact as
related to me and others in public by said [Common Sense.]Nor do I
believe that Rome or the whole Romish Church has a better attested
miracle in her whole Catalogue than the above--though I dont wish to
deem it a miracle, nor do I believe there is any miracle upon record for
these 18 hundred years so true as that being General Washington's great
coat.--I, labouring hard for said Common Sense at Bordentown, the said
coat was hung up to keep snow out of the room.I often told him I should
expect that for my pains, but he never would say I should; but having
a chest there I took care and locked it up when I had finished my work,
and sent it to you.So far are these historical facts--Maybe sometime
hence I may collect dates and periods to them--But why should they be
disputed?has not the world adopted as true a-many affairs without date
and of less moment than this, and even pay what is called a holy regard
to them?"If you communicate this to your Father and he feels a compunction for
the above crime and will signify the same by letter, he will find I
strictly adhere to the precepts of Christianity and shall forgive.--If
not------

"My best wishes to you all,

"John Hall."John
Coltman's, Shambles Lane, Leicester, England.""My old Friend: I am very happy to see a letter from you, and to hear
that our Friends on the other side the water are well.The Bridge has
been put up, but being on wood butments they yielded, and it is now
taken down.The first rib as an experiment was erected between two steel
furnaces which supported it firmly; it contained not quite three tons of
iron, was ninety feet span, height of the arch five feet; it was loaded
with six tons of iron, which remained upon it a twelve month.At present
I am engaged on my political Bridge.I shall bring out a new work
(Second part of the Rights of Man) soon after New Year.It will produce
something one way or other.I see the tide is yet the wrong way, but
there is a change of sentiment beginning.I have so far got the ear of
John Bull that he will read what I write--which is more than ever was
done before to the same extent.Rights of Man has had the greatest
run of anything ever published in this country, at least of late
years--almost sixteen thousand has gone off--and in Ireland above forty
thousand--besides the above numbers one thousand printed cheap are now
gone to Scotland by desire from some of the [friends] there.I have been
applied to from Birmingham for leave to print ten thousand copies, but
I intend, after the next work has had its run among those who will have
handsome printed books and fine paper, to print an hundred thousand
copies of each work and distribute them at sixpence a-piece; but this I
do not at present talk of, because it will alarm the wise mad folks at
St.Jefferson who mentioned
the great run it has had there.It has been attacked by John Adams, who
has brought an host about his ears from all parts of the Continent.Jefferson has sent me twenty five different answers to Adams who wrote
under the signature of Publicola.A letter is somewhere in the city for
me from Mr.I hope to receive it in a few days.I shall be glad at all times to see, or hear from you.Write to me
(under cover) to Gordon, Booksellers N: 166 Fleet Street, before
you leave Leicester.How far is it from thence to Rotherham?"P. S. I have done you the compliment of answering your favor the inst.it which is more than I have done by any other--were I to ans.all the letters I receive--I should require half a dozen clerks."Extracts from John Hall's letters from London, England: London, January
1792 Burke's publication has produced one way or other near 50 different
answers and publications.Nothing of late ever has been so read as
Paine's answer.Sometime shortly he will publish a second part of the
Rights of Man.His first part was scrutinized by the Privy Council
held on purpose and through fear of making him more popular deemed too
contemptible for Government notice.The sale of it for a day or two was
rather retarded or not publickly disposed of until it was known by the
printers that it would not be noticed by Government.John Hall to a friend in England:

"London, Nov.I dined yesterday with the Revolution Society at
the London Tavern.A very large company assembled and after dinner
many truly noble and patriotic toasts were drank.The most prominent
were--The Rights of Man--with 3 times &c.--The Revolution of France--The
Revolution of the World--May all the armies of tyrants learn the
Brunswick March--May the tree of Liberty be planted in every tyrant
city, and may it be an evergreen.The utmost unanimity prevailed through
the company, and several very excellent songs in favor of Liberty
were sung.Every bosom felt the divine glow of patriotism and love
of universal freedom.For my part I was
transported at the scene.It happened that a company of Aristocratic
french and Spanish merchants were met in the very room under, and
Horne Tooke got up and sarcastically requested the company not to wound
the tender feelings of the gentlemen by too much festivity.This sarcasm
was followed by such a burst of applause as I never before heard."From J. Redman, London, Tuesday Dec.18, 5 p. m. to John Hall,
Leicester, England: "Mr.Erskine
shone like the morning-Star.The instant Erskine
closed his speech the venal jury interrupted the Attorney General, who
was about to make a reply, and without waiting for any answer, or any
summing up by the Judge, pronounced him guilty.Such an instance of
infernal corruption is scarcely upon record.I have not time to express
my indignant feelings on this occasion.At this moment, while I write,
the mob is drawing Erskine's carriage home, he riding in triumph--his
horses led by another party.Riots at Cambridge, Manchester, Bridport
Dorset &c.&c. O England, how art thou fallen!I am just now told that
press warrants are issued today.[John Hall's London Journal (1792) records frequent meetings there with
Paine.Paine going to dress on an invitation to dine
with the Athenians.He leaves town for a few days to see his aunt."Paine goes out of town tomorrow to compose what I call
Burke's Funeral Sermon."Paine looking well and in high
spirits."Does not seem to
talk much, rather on a reserve, of the prospect of political affairs.He had a letter from G. Washington and Jefferson by the ambassador
[Pinckney]."The majority of entries merely mention meeting Paine, whose
name, by the way, after the prosecution was instituted, Hall prudently
writes "P------n."He also tells the story of Burke's pension.]Had a ride to Bordentown to see Mr.He was well and appeared jollyer than I had ever known him.He is full of whims and schemes and mechanical inventions, and is to
build a place or shop to carry them into execution, and wants my help."APPENDIX C. PORTRAITS OF PAINE

At the age of thirty Paine was somewhat stout, and very athletic; but
after his arrival in America (1774) he was rather slender.His height
was five feet, nine inches.He had a prominent nose, somewhat like that
of Ralph Waldo Emerson.It may have impressed Bonaparte, who insisted,
it is said, that a marshal must have a large nose.Paine's mouth was
delicate, his chin also; he wore no whiskers or beard until too feeble
with age to shave.His forehead was lofty and unfurrowed; his head
long, the occiput feeble.His complexion was ruddy,--thoroughly English.Charles Lee, during the American revolution, described him as "the man
who has genius in his eyes;" Carlyle quotes from Foster an observation
on the brilliancy of Paine's eyes, as he sat in the French Convention.His figure, as given in an early French portrait, is shapely; its
elegance was often remarked.A year or so after his return to America he
is shown in a contemporary picture as somewhat stout again, if one may
judge by the face.This was probably a result of insufficient exercise,
on which he much depended.He was an expert horseman, and, in health, an
unwearied walker.He loved music, and could join well in a chorus.There are eleven original portraits of Thomas Paine, besides a
death-mask, a bust, and the profile copied in this work from a seal used
on the release at Lewes, elsewhere cited (i., p.That gives some
idea of the head and face at the age of thirty-five.I have a picture
said to be that of Paine in his youth, but the dress is an anachronism.The earliest portrait of Paine was painted by Charles Willson Peale, in
Philadelphia, probably in some early year of the American Revolution,
for Thomas Brand Hollis, of London,--the benefactor of Harvard
University, one of whose halls bears his name.The same artist painted
another portrait of Paine, now badly placed in Independence Hall.There
must have been an early engraving from one of Peale's pictures, for John
Hall writes October 31, 1786: "A print of Common Sense, if any of my
friends want one, may be had by sending to the printshops in London,
but they have put a wrong name to it, his being Thomas."* The Hollis
portrait was engraved in London, 1791, underlined "by Peel [sic] of
Philadelphia," and published, July 25th, by J. Ridgway, York Street, St.Paine holds an open book bearing the words, "Rights of
Man," where Peale probably had "Common Sense."On a table with inkstand
and pens rests Paine's right elbow, the hand supporting his chin.The
full face appears--young, handsome, gay; the wig is frizzed, a bit of
the queue visible.In all of the original portraits of Paine his dress
is neat and in accordance with fashion, but in this Hollis picture it
is rather fine: the loose sleeves are ornamentally corded, and large
wristbands of white lace fall on the cuffs.The only engraving I have found with
     "Toia" was published in London in 1800.Can there be a
     portrait lost under some other name?While Paine and Jefferson were together in Paris (1787) Paine wrote him
a note, August 18th, in which he says: "The second part of your letter,
concerning taking my picture, I must feel as an honor done to me, not
as a favor asked of me--but in this, as in other matters, I am at the
disposal of your friendship."As Jefferson does not appear to have
possessed such a portrait, the request was probably made through him.I
incline to identify this portrait with an extremely interesting one, now
in this country, by an unknown artist.It is one of twelve symmetrical
portraits of revolutionary leaders,--the others being Marat,
Robespierre, Lafayette, Mirabeau, Danton, Brissot, Petion, Camille
Desmoulins, Billaud de Varennes, Gensonne, Clermont Tonnere.These
pictures were reproduced in cheap woodcuts and distributed about France
during the Revolution.Lowry, of
South Carolina, and brought to Charleston during the Revolution.At
the beginning of the civil war they were buried in leaden cases at
Williamstown, South Carolina.At the end of the war they were conveyed
to Charleston, where they remained, in the possession of a Mrs.Cole,
until purchased by their present owner, Mr.Alfred Ames Howlett, of
Syracuse, New York.As Mirabeau is included, the series must have been
begun at an early phase of the revolutionary agitation.The face of
Paine here strongly resembles that in Independence Hall.The picture
is about two feet high; the whole figure is given, and is dressed in an
elegant statesmanlike fashion, with fine cravat and silk stockings from
the knee.The table and room indicate official position, but it is the
same room as in nine of the other portraits.It is to be hoped that
further light may be obtained concerning these portraits.Well-dressed also, but notably unlike the preceding, is the "Bonneville
Paine," one of a celebrated series of two hundred engraved portraits,
the publication of which in quarto volumes was begun in Paris in
1796.et sculpsit" is its whole history.Paine is
described in it as "Ex Depute a la Convention Nationale," which would
mean strictly some time between his expulsion from that assembly
in December, 1793, and his recall to it a year later.It could not,
however, have been then taken, on account of Paine's imprisonment and
illness.It was probably made by F. Bonneville when Paine had gone to
reside with Nicolas Bonneville in the spring of 1797.It is an admirable
picture in every way, but especially in bringing out the large and
expressive eyes.The hair is here free and flowing; the dress identical
with that of the portrait by Jarvis in this work.The best-known picture of Paine is that painted by his friend George
Romney, in 1792.I have inquired through London _Notes and Queries_
after the original, which long ago disappeared, and a claimant turned up
in Birmingham, England; but in this the hand holds a book, and Sharp's
engraving shows no hand.The large engraving by W. Sharp was published April 20, 1793, and the
smaller in 1794.A reproduction by Illman were a fit frontispiece for
Cheetham (what satirical things names are sometimes), but ought not
to have got into Gilbert Vale's popular biography of Paine.That and
a reproduction by Wright in the Mendum edition of Paine's works, have
spread through this country something little better than a caricature;
and one Sweden has subjected Truelove's edition, in England, to a
like misfortune.Paine's friends, Rickman, Constable, and others, were
satisfied by the Romney picture, and I have seen in G. J. Holyoake's
library a proof of the large engraving, with an inscription on the back
by Paine, who presented it to Rickman.It is the English Paine, in all
his vigor, and in the thick of his conflict with Burke, but, noble as
it is, has not the gentler and more poetic expression which Bonneville
found in the liberated prisoner surrounded by affectionate friends.Romney and Sharp were both well acquainted with Paine.A picturesque Paine is one engraved for Baxter's "History of England,"
and published by Symonds, July 2, 1796.Dressed with great elegance,
Paine stands pointing to a scroll in his left hand, inscribed "Rights
of Man."Above his head, on a frame design, a pen lies on a roll marked
"Equality."The face is handsome and the likeness good

A miniature by H. Richards is known to me only as engraved by K.
Mackenzie, and published March 31, 1800, by G. Gawthorne, British
Library, Strand, London.It is the only portrait that has beneath it
"Tom Paine."It represents Paine as rather stout, and the face broad.It is powerful, but the least pleasing of the portraits.The picture in
Vale resembles this more than the Romney it professes to copy.I have in my possession a wood engraving of Paine, which gives no trace
of its source or period.It is a vigorous profile, which might have
been made in London during the excitement over the "Rights of Man," for
popular distribution.It has no wig, and shows the head extraordinarily
long, and without much occiput It is pre-eminently the English radical
leader.Before speaking of Jarvis' great portrait of Paine, I mention a later
one by him which Mr.William Erving, of New York, has added to my
collection.It would appear to have been circulated at the time of his
death.The lettering beneath, following a facsimile autograph, is: "J.
W. Jarvis, pinx.J- R. Ames, del.--L'Homme des Deux Mondes.Born
at Thetford, England, Jan.Died at Greenwich, New
York, June 8, 1809."Above the cheap wood-cut is: "A tribute to Paine."On the right, at the top, is a globe, showing the outlines of the
Americas, France, England, and Africa.It is supported by the wing of a
dove with large olive-branch.On the left upper corner is an open book
inscribed: "Rights of Man.Crisis": supported by a scroll
with "Doing justice, loving mercy.From this book rays
break out and illumine the globe opposite.A lower corner shows the
balances, and the liberty-cap on a pole, the left being occupied by the
United States flag and that of France.Beneath are the broken chain,
crown, sword, and other emblems of oppression.A frame rises showing a
plumb line, at the top of which the key of the Bastille is crossed by
a pen, on Paine's breast.The portrait is surrounded by a "Freedom's
Wreath" in which are traceable the floral emblems of all nations.The
wreath is bound with a fascia, on which appear, by twos, the following
names: "Washington, Monroe; Jefferson, Franklin; J. Stewart, E. Palmer;
Barlow, Rush; M. Wollstone-craft, M. B. Bonneville; Clio Rickman, J.
Home Tooke; Lafayette, Brissot."The portrait of Paine represents him with an unusually full face,
as compared with earlier pictures, and a most noble and benevolent
expression.The white cravat and dress are elegant.What has become of
the original of this second picture by the elder Jarvis?It might easily
have fallen to some person who might not recognize it as meant for
Paine, though to one who has studied his countenance it conveys the
impression of what he probably would have been at sixty-eight.About two
years later a drawing was made of Paine by William Constable, which I
saw at the house of his nephew, Dr.Clair J. Grece, Redhill, England.It
reveals the ravages of age, but conveys a vivid impression of the man's
power.After Paine's death Jarvis took a cast of his face.Laurence
Hutton has had for many years this death-mask which was formerly in the
establishment of Fowler and Wells, the phrenologists, and probably used
by George Combe in his lectures.This mask has not the large nose of the
bust; but that is known to have been added afterwards.The bust is in
the New York Historical Society's rooms.In an article on Paine in the
_Atlantic Monthly_ (1856) it was stated that this bust had to be hidden
by the Historical Society to prevent its injury by haters of Paine.Robertson, of London, in his "Thomas Paine, an
Investigation."Kelby, of that Society, that the
statement is unfounded.The Society has not room to exhibit its entire
collection, and the bust of Paine was for some time out of sight, but
from no such reason as that stated, still less from any prejudice.The
face is that of Paine in extreme dilapidation, and would be a dismal
misrepresentation if shown in a public place.Before me are examples of all the portraits I have mentioned (except
that in Birmingham), and I have observed contemporary representations of
Paine in caricatures or in apotheosis of fly-leaves.Comparative studies
convince me that the truest portrait of Paine is that painted by John
Wesley Jarvis in 1803, and now in possession of Mr.J. H. Johnston, of
New York.The picture from which our frontispiece is taken appeared to
be a replica, of somewhat later date, the colors being fresher, but an
inscription on the back says "Charles W. Jarvis, pinxit, July, 1857."From this perfect duplicate Clark Mills made his portrait-bust of Paine
now in the National Museum at Washington, but it has not hitherto been
engraved.Alas, that no art can send out to the world what colors only
can convey,--the sensibility, the candor, the spirituality, transfusing
the strong features of Thomas Paine.As I have sat at my long task, now
drawn to a close, the face there on the wall has seemed to be alive, now
flushed with hope, now shadowed with care, the eyes greeting me daily,
the firm mouth assigning some password--Truth, Justice.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Life Of Thomas Paine, Vol.Once for all this question settle
        Sweater shall Prevail!'The carriage containing Sir Featherstone, Adam Sweater, and Rushton and
Didlum was in the middle of the procession.The banner and the torches
were at the head, and the grandeur of the scene was heightened by four
men who walked--two on each side of the carriage, burning green fire in
frying pans.As they passed by the Slave Market, a poor, shabbily
dressed wretch whose boots were so worn and rotten that they were
almost falling off his feet, climbed up a lamp-post, and taking off his
cap waved it in the air and shrieked out: 'Three Cheers for Sir
Featherstone Blood, our future Prime Minister!'The Philanthropists cheered themselves hoarse and finally took the
horses out of the traces and harnessed themselves to the carriage
instead.''Ow much wages will Sir Featherstone get if 'e is made Prime
Minister?'asked Harlow of another Philanthropist who was also pushing
up behind the carriage.'Five thousand a year,' replied the other, who by some strange chance
happened to know.'That comes to a 'underd pounds a week.''Little enough, too, for a man like 'im,' said Harlow.'You're right, mate,' said the other, with deep sympathy in his voice.'Last time 'e 'eld office 'e was only in for five years, so 'e only
made twenty-five thousand pounds out of it.Of course 'e got a pension
as well--two thousand a year for life, I think it is; but after all,
what's that--for a man like 'im?''Nothing,' replied Harlow, in a tone of commiseration, and Newman, who
was also there, helping to drag the carriage, said that it ought to be
at least double that amount.However, they found some consolation in knowing that Sir Featherstone
would not have to wait till he was seventy before he obtained his
pension; he would get it directly he came out of office.The following evening Barrington, Owen and a few others of the same way
of thinking, who had subscribed enough money between them to purchase a
lot of Socialist leaflets, employed themselves distributing them to the
crowds at the Liberal and Tory meetings, and whilst they were doing
this they frequently became involved in arguments with the supporters
of the capitalist system.In their attempts to persuade others to
refrain from voting for either of the candidates, they were opposed
even by some who professed to believe in Socialism, who said that as
there was no better Socialist candidate the thing to do was to vote for
the better of the two.This was the view of Harlow and Easton, whom
they met.Harlow had a green ribbon in his buttonhole, but Easton wore
D'Encloseland's colours.One man said that if he had his way, all those who had votes should be
compelled to record them--whether they liked it or not--or be
disenfranchised!Barrington asked him if he believed in Tarrif Reform.The other replied that he opposed Tariff Reform because he believed it
would ruin the country.Barrington inquired if he were a supporter of
Socialism.The man said he was not, and when further questioned he
said that he believed if it were ever adopted it would bring black ruin
upon the country--he believed this because Mr Sweater had said so.When
Barrington asked him--supposing there were only two candidates, one a
Socialist and the other a Tariff Reformer--how would he like to be
compelled to vote for one of them, he was at a loss for an answer.The hired orators
continued to pour forth their streams of eloquence; and tons of
literature flooded the town.The walls were covered with huge posters:
'Another Liberal Lie.'Unconsciously each of these two parties put in some splendid work for
Socialism, in so much that each of them thoroughly exposed the
hypocrisy of the other.If the people had only had the sense, they
might have seen that the quarrel between the Liberal and Tory leaders
was merely a quarrel between thieves over the spoil; but unfortunately
most of the people had not the sense to perceive this.They were
blinded by bigoted devotion to their parties, and--inflamed with
maniacal enthusiasm--thought of nothing but 'carrying their flags to
victory'.At considerable danger to themselves, Barrington, Owen and the other
Socialists continued to distribute their leaflets and to heckle the
Liberal and Tory speakers.They asked the Tories to explain the
prevalence of unemployment and poverty in protected countries, like
Germany and America, and at Sweater's meetings they requested to be
informed what was the Liberal remedy for unemployment.From both
parties the Socialists obtained the same kinds of answer--threats of
violence and requests 'not to disturb the meeting'.These Socialists held quite a lot of informal meetings on their own.Every now and then when they were giving their leaflets away, some
unwary supporter of the capitalist system would start an argument, and
soon a crowd would gather round and listen.Sometimes the Socialists succeeded in arguing their opponents to an
absolute standstill, for the Liberals and Tones found it impossible to
deny that machinery is the cause of the overcrowded state of the labour
market; that the overcrowded labour market is the cause of
unemployment; that the fact of there being always an army of unemployed
waiting to take other men's jobs away from them destroys the
independence of those who are in employment and keeps them in
subjection to their masters.They found it impossible to deny that
this machinery is being used, not for the benefit of all, but to make
fortunes for a few.In short, they were unable to disprove that the
monopoly of the land and machinery by a comparatively few persons, is
the cause of the poverty of the majority.But when these arguments
that they were unable to answer were put before them and when it was
pointed out that the only possible remedy was the Public Ownership and
Management of the Means of production, they remained angrily silent,
having no alternative plan to suggest.At other times the meeting resolved itself into a number of quarrelsome
disputes between the Liberals and Tories that formed the crowd, which
split itself up into a lot of little groups and whatever the original
subject might have been they soon drifted to a hundred other things,
for most of the supporters of the present system seemed incapable of
pursuing any one subject to its logical conclusion.A discussion would
be started about something or other; presently an unimportant side
issue would crop up, then the original subject would be left
unfinished, and they would argue and shout about the side issue.In a
little while another side issue would arise, and then the first side
issue would be abandoned also unfinished, and an angry wrangle about
the second issue would ensue, the original subject being altogether
forgotten.They did not seem to really desire to discover the truth or to find out
the best way to bring about an improvement in their condition, their
only object seemed to be to score off their opponents.Usually after one of these arguments, Owen would wander off by himself,
with his head throbbing and a feeling of unutterable depression and
misery at his heart; weighed down by a growing conviction of the
hopelessness of everything, of the folly of expecting that his fellow
workmen would ever be willing to try to understand for themselves the
causes that produced their sufferings.It was not that those causes
were so obscure that it required exceptional intelligence to perceive
them; the causes of all the misery were so apparent that a little child
could easily be made to understand both the disease and the remedy; but
it seemed to him that the majority of his fellow workmen had become so
convinced of their own intellectual inferiority that they did not dare
to rely on their own intelligence to guide them, preferring to resign
the management of their affairs unreservedly into the hands of those
who battened upon and robbed them.They did not know the causes of the
poverty that perpetually held them and their children in its cruel
grip, and--they did not want to know!And if one explained those
causes to them in such language and in such a manner that they were
almost compelled to understand, and afterwards pointed out to them the
obvious remedy, they were neither glad nor responsive, but remained
silent and were angry because they found themselves unable to answer
and disprove.They remained silent; afraid to trust their own intelligence, and the
reason of this attitude was that they had to choose between the
evidence and their own intelligence, and the stories told them by their
masters and exploiters.And when it came to making this choice they
deemed it safer to follow their old guides, than to rely on their own
judgement, because from their very infancy they had had drilled into
them the doctrine of their own mental and social inferiority, and their
conviction of the truth of this doctrine was voiced in the degraded
expression that fell so frequently from their lips, when speaking of
themselves and each other--'The Likes of Us!'They did not know the causes of their poverty, they did not want to
know, they did not want to hear.All they desired was to be left alone so that they might continue to
worship and follow those who took advantage of their simplicity, and
robbed them of the fruits of their toil; their old leaders, the fools
or scoundrels who fed them with words, who had led them into the
desolation where they now seemed to be content to grind out treasure
for their masters, and to starve when those masters did not find it
profitable to employ them.It was as if a flock of foolish sheep
placed themselves under the protection of a pack of ravening wolves.Several times the small band of Socialists narrowly escaped being
mobbed, but they succeeded in disposing of most of their leaflets
without any serious trouble.Towards the latter part of one evening
Barrington and Owen became separated from the others, and shortly
afterwards these two lost each other in the crush.About nine o'clock, Barrington was in a large Liberal crowd, listening
to the same hired orator who had spoken a few evenings before on the
hill--the man with the scar on his forehead.The crowd was applauding
him loudly and Barrington again fell to wondering where he had seen
this man before.As on the previous occasion, this speaker made no
reference to Socialism, confining himself to other matters.Barrington
examined him closely, trying to recall under what circumstances they
had met previously, and presently he remembered that this was one of
the Socialists who had come with the band of cyclists into the town
that Sunday morning, away back at the beginning of the summer, the man
who had come afterwards with the van, and who had been struck down by a
stone while attempting to speak from the platform of the van, the man
who had been nearly killed by the upholders of the capitalist system.The Socialist had been clean-shaven--this man
wore beard and moustache--but Barrington was certain he was the same.When the man had concluded his speech he got down and stood in the
shade behind the platform, while someone else addressed the meeting,
and Barrington went round to where he was standing, intending to speak
to him.They were in the
vicinity of the Slave Market, near the Fountain, on the Grand Parade,
where several roads met; there was a meeting going on at every corner,
and a number of others in different parts of the roadway and on the
pavement of the Parade.Some of these meetings were being carried on by
two or three men, who spoke in turn from small, portable platforms they
carried with them, and placed wherever they thought there was a chance
of getting an audience.Every now and then some of these poor wretches--they were all paid
speakers--were surrounded and savagely mauled and beaten by a hostile
crowd.If they were Tariff Reformers the Liberals mobbed them, and
vice versa.Lines of rowdies swaggered to and fro, arm in arm,
singing, 'Vote, Vote, Vote, for good ole Closeland' or 'good ole
Sweater', according as they were green or blue and yellow.Gangs of
hooligans paraded up and down, armed with sticks, singing, howling,
cursing and looking for someone to hit.Others stood in groups on the
pavement with their hands thrust in their pockets, or leaned against
walls or the shutters of the shops with expressions of ecstatic
imbecility on their faces, chanting the mournful dirge to the tune of
the church chimes,

        'Good--ole--Sweat--er
        Good--ole--Sweat--er
        Good--ole--Sweat--er
        Good--ole--Sweat--er.'Other groups--to the same tune--sang 'Good--ole--Close--land'; and
every now and again they used to leave off singing and begin to beat
each other.Fights used to take place, often between workmen, about
the respective merits of Adam Sweater and Sir Graball D'Encloseland.The walls were covered with huge Liberal and Tory posters, which showed
in every line the contempt of those who published them for the
intelligence of the working men to whom they were addressed.There was
one Tory poster that represented the interior of a public house; in
front of the bar, with a quart pot in his hand, a clay pipe in his
mouth, and a load of tools on his back, stood a degraded-looking brute
who represented the Tory ideal of what an Englishman should be; the
letterpress on the poster said it was a man!This is the ideal of
manhood that they hold up to the majority of their fellow countrymen,
but privately--amongst themselves--the Tory aristocrats regard such
'men' with far less respect than they do the lower animals.They were more
cunning, more specious, more hypocritical and consequently more
calculated to mislead and deceive the more intelligent of the voters.When Barrington got round to the back of the platform, he found the man
with the scarred face standing alone and gloomily silent in the shadow.Barrington gave him one of the Socialist leaflets, which he took, and
after glancing at it, put it in his coat pocket without making any
remark.'I hope you'll excuse me for asking, but were you not formerly a
Socialist?'Even in the semi-darkness Barrington saw the other man flush deeply and
then become very pale, and the unsightly scar upon his forehead showed
with ghastly distinctiveness.'I am still a Socialist: no man who has once been a Socialist can ever
cease to be one.''You seem to have accomplished that impossibility, to judge by the work
you are at present engaged in.You must have changed your opinions
since you were here last.''No one who has been a Socialist can ever cease to be one.It is
impossible for a man who has once acquired knowledge ever to relinquish
it.A Socialist is one who understands the causes of the misery and
degradation we see all around us; who knows the only remedy, and knows
that that remedy--the state of society that will be called
Socialism--must eventually be adopted; is the only alternative to the
extermination of the majority of the working people; but it does not
follow that everyone who has sense enough to acquire that amount of
knowledge, must, in addition, be willing to sacrifice himself in order
to help to bring that state of society into being.When I first
acquired that knowledge,' he continued, bitterly, 'I was eager to tell
the good news to others.I sacrificed my time, my money, and my health
in order that I might teach others what I had learned myself.I did it
willingly and happily, because I thought they would be glad to hear,
and that they were worth the sacrifices I made for their sakes.'Even if you no longer believe in working for Socialism, there's no
need to work AGAINST it.If you are not disposed to sacrifice yourself
in order to do good to others, you might at least refrain from doing
evil.If you don't want to help to bring about a better state of
affairs, there's no reason why you should help to perpetuate the
present system.''Oh yes, there is, and a very good
reason too.''I don't think you could show me a reason,' said Barrington.The man with the scar laughed again, the same unpleasant, mirthless
laugh, and thrusting his hand into his trouser pocket drew it out again
full of silver coins, amongst which one or two gold pieces glittered.When I devoted my life and what abilities I
possess to the service of my fellow workmen; when I sought to teach
them how to break their chains; when I tried to show them how they
might save their children from poverty and shameful servitude, I did
not want them to give me money.And they paid me
with hatred and injury.But since I have been helping their masters to
rob them, they have treated me with respect.'Barrington made no reply and the other man, having returned the money
to his pocket, indicated the crowd with a sweep of his hand.the people you are trying to make idealists of!Some of
them howling and roaring like wild beasts, or laughing like idiots,
others standing with dull and stupid faces devoid of any trace of
intelligence or expression, listening to the speakers whose words
convey no meaning to their stultified minds, and others with their eyes
gleaming with savage hatred of their fellow men, watching eagerly for
an opportunity to provoke a quarrel that they may gratify their brutal
natures by striking someone--their eyes are hungry for the sight of
blood!Can't you see that these people, whom you are trying to make
understand your plan for the regeneration of the world, your doctrine
of universal brotherhood and love are for the most
part--intellectually--on a level with Hottentots?The only things they
feel any real interest in are beer, football, betting and--of
course--one other subject.Their highest ambition is to be allowed to
Work.'They have never had an independent thought in their lives.These are
the people whom you hope to inspire with lofty ideals!You might just
as well try to make a gold brooch out of a lump of dung!Try to reason
with them, to uplift them, to teach them the way to higher things.Devote your whole life and intelligence to the work of trying to get
better conditions for them, and you will find that they themselves are
the enemy you will have to fight against.They'll hate you, and, if
they get the chance, they'll tear you to pieces.But if you're a
sensible man you'll use whatever talents and intelligence you possess
for your own benefit.Don't think about Socialism or any other "ism".Concentrate your mind on getting money--it doesn't matter how you get
it, but--get it.If you can't get it honestly, get it dishonestly, but
get it!and then they'll have some respect for you.''There's something in what you say,' replied Barrington, after a long
pause, 'but it's not all.Circumstances make us what we are; and
anyhow, the children are worth fighting for.''You may think so now,' said the other, 'but you'll come to see it my
way some day.As for the children--if their parents are satisfied to
let them grow up to be half-starved drudges for other people, I don't
see why you or I need trouble about it.If you like to listen to
reason,' he continued after a pause, 'I can put you on to something
that will be worth more to you than all your Socialism.''Look here: you're a Socialist; well, I'm a Socialist too: that is, I
have sense enough to believe that Socialism is practical and inevitable
and right; it will come when the majority of the people are
sufficiently enlightened to demand it, but that enlightenment will
never be brought about by reasoning or arguing with them, for these
people are simply not intellectually capable of abstract
reasoning--they can't grasp theories.You know what the late Lord
Salisbury said about them when somebody proposed to give them some free
libraries: He said: "They don't want libraries: give them a circus."You see these Liberals and Tories understand the sort of people they
have to deal with; they know that although their bodies are the bodies
of grown men, their minds are the minds of little children.That is
why it has been possible to deceive and bluff and rob them for so long.But your party persists in regarding them as rational beings, and
that's where you make a mistake--you're simply wasting your time.'The only way in which it is possible to teach these people is by means
of object lessons, and those are being placed before them in increasing
numbers every day.The trustification of industry--the object lesson
which demonstrates the possibility of collective ownership--will in
time compel even these to understand, and by the time they have learnt
that, they will also have learned by bitter experience and not from
theoretical teaching, that they must either own the trusts or perish,
and then, and not, till then, they will achieve Socialism.Do you think it will make any real
difference--for good or evil--which of these two men is elected?''Well, you can't keep them both out--you have no candidate of your
own--why should you object to earning a few pounds by helping one of
them to get in?There are plenty of voters who are doubtful what to
do; as you and I know there is every excuse for them being unable to
make up their minds which of these two candidates is the worse, a word
from your party would decide them.Since you have no candidate of your
own you will be doing no harm to Socialism and you will be doing
yourself a bit of good.If you like to come along with me now, I'll
introduce you to Sweater's agent--no one need know anything about it.'He slipped his arm through Barrington's, but the latter released
himself.'Please yourself,' said the other with an affectation of indifference.You may choose to be a Jesus Christ
if you like, but for my part I'm finished.For the future I intend to
look after myself.As for these people--they vote for what they want;
they get--what they vote for; and by God, they deserve nothing better!They are being beaten with whips of their own choosing and if I had my
way they should be chastised with scorpions!For them, the present
system means joyless drudgery, semi-starvation, rags and premature
death.Well, let them have what
they vote for--let them drudge--let them starve!'The man with the scarred face ceased speaking, and for some moments
Barrington did not reply.'I suppose there is some excuse for your feeling as you do,' he said
slowly at last, 'but it seems to me that you do not make enough
allowance for the circumstances.From their infancy most of them have
been taught by priests and parents to regard themselves and their own
class with contempt--a sort of lower animals--and to regard those who
possess wealth with veneration, as superior beings.The idea that they
are really human creatures, naturally absolutely the same as their
so-called betters, naturally equal in every way, naturally different
from them only in those ways in which their so-called superiors differ
from each other, and inferior to them only because they have been
deprived of education, culture and opportunity--you know as well as I
do that they have all been taught to regard that idea as preposterous.'The self-styled "Christian" priests who say--with their tongues in
their cheeks--that God is our Father and that all men are brethren,
have succeeded in convincing the majority of the "brethren" that it is
their duty to be content in their degradation, and to order themselves
lowly and reverently towards their masters.Your resentment should be
directed against the deceivers, not against the dupes.''Well, go and try to undeceive them,' he said, as he returned to the
platform in response to a call from his associates.'Go and try to
teach them that the Supreme Being made the earth and all its fullness
for the use and benefit of all His children.Go and try to explain to
them that they are poor in body and mind and social condition, not
because of any natural inferiority, but because they have been robbed
of their inheritance.Go and try to show them how to secure that
inheritance for themselves and their children--and see how grateful
they'll be to you.'For the next hour Barrington walked about the crowded streets in a
dispirited fashion.His conversation with the renegade seemed to have
taken all the heart out of him.He still had a number of the leaflets,
but the task of distributing them had suddenly grown distasteful and
after a while he discontinued it.Like
one awakened from a dream he saw the people who surrounded him in a
different light.For the first time he properly appreciated the
offensiveness of most of those to whom he offered the handbills; some,
without even troubling to ascertain what they were about, rudely
refused to accept them; some took them and after glancing at the
printing, crushed them in their hands and ostentatiously threw them
away.Others, who recognized him as a Socialist, angrily or
contemptuously declined them, often with curses or injurious words.His attention was presently attracted to a crowd of about thirty or
forty people, congregated near a gas lamp at the roadside.The sound
of many angry voices rose from the centre of this group, and as he
stood on the outskirts of the crowd, Barrington, being tall, was able
to look into the centre, where he saw Owen.The light of the street
lamp fell full upon the latter's pale face, as he stood silent in the
midst of a ring of infuriated men, who were all howling at him at once,
and whose malignant faces bore expressions of savage hatred, as they
shouted out the foolish accusations and slanders they had read in the
Liberal and Tory papers.Socialists wished to do away with religion and morality!All the money that the working classes had
saved up in the Post Office and the Friendly Societies, was to be
Robbed from them and divided up amongst a lot of drunken loafers who
were too lazy to work.The King and all the Royal Family were to be
Done Away with!Owen made no attempt to reply, and the manner of the crowd became every
moment more threatening.It was evident that several of them found it
difficult to refrain from attacking him.It was a splendid opportunity
of doing a little fighting without running any risks.This fellow was
all by himself, and did not appear to be much of a man even at that.Those in the middle were encouraged by shouts from others in the crowd,
who urged them to 'Go for him' and at last--almost at the instant of
Barrington's arrival--one of the heroes, unable to contain himself any
longer, lifted a heavy stick and struck Owen savagely across the face.The sight of the blood maddened the others, and in an instant everyone
who could get within striking distance joined furiously in the
onslaught, reaching eagerly over each other's shoulders, showering
blows upon him with sticks and fists, and before Barrington could reach
his side, they had Owen down on the ground, and had begun to use their
boots upon him.Barrington felt like a wild beast himself, as he fiercely fought his
way through the crowd, spurning them to right and left with fists and
elbows.He reached the centre in time to seize the uplifted arm of the
man who had led the attack and wrenching the stick from his hand, he
felled him to the ground with a single blow.The remainder shrank
back, and meantime the crowd was augmented by others who came running
up.Some of these newcomers were Liberals and some Tories, and as these did
not know what the row was about they attacked each other.The Liberals
went for those who wore Tory colours and vice versa, and in a few
seconds there was a general free fight, though most of the original
crowd ran away, and in the confusion that ended, Barrington and Owen
got out of the crowd without further molestation.Monday was the last day of the election--polling day--and in
consequence of the number of motor cars that were flying about, the
streets were hardly safe for ordinary traffic.The wealthy persons who
owned these carriages...

The result of the poll was to be shown on an illuminated sign at the
Town Hall, at eleven o'clock that night, and long before that hour a
vast crowd gathered in the adjacent streets.About ten o'clock it
began to rain, but the crowd stood its ground and increased in numbers
as the time went by.At a quarter to eleven the rain increased to a
terrible downpour, but the people remained waiting to know which hero
had conquered.Eleven o'clock came and an intense silence fell upon
the crowd, whose eyes were fixed eagerly upon the window where the sign
was to be exhibited.To judge by the extraordinary interest displayed
by these people, one might have thought that they expected to reap some
great benefit or to sustain some great loss from the result, but of
course that was not the case, for most of them knew perfectly well that
the result of this election would make no more real difference to them
than all the other elections that had gone before.There were ten thousand
voters on the register.At a quarter past eleven the sign was
illuminated, but the figures were not yet shown.Next, the names of
the two candidates were slid into sight, the figures were still
missing, but D'Encloseland's name was on top, and a hoarse roar of
triumph came from the throats of his admirers.Then the two slides
with the names were withdrawn, and the sign was again left blank.After
a time the people began to murmur at all this delay and messing about,
and presently some of them began to groan and hoot.After a few minutes the names were again slid into view, this time with
Sweater's name on top, and the figures appeared immediately afterwards:

        Sweater.4,221
        D'Encloseland.4,200

It was several seconds before the Liberals could believe their eyes; it
was too good to be true.It is impossible to say what was the reason
of the wild outburst of delighted enthusiasm that followed, but
whatever the reason, whatever the benefit was that they expected to
reap--there was the fact.They were all cheering and dancing and
shaking hands with each other, and some of them were so overcome with
inexplicable joy that they were scarcely able to speak.It was
altogether extraordinary and unaccountable.A few minutes after the declaration, Sweater appeared at the window and
made a sort of a speech, but only fragments of it were audible to the
cheering crowd who at intervals caught such phrases as 'Slashing Blow',
'Sweep the Country', 'Grand Old Liberal Flag', and so on.Next
D'Encloseland appeared and he was seen to shake hands with Mr Sweater,
whom he referred to as 'My friend'.When the two 'friends' disappeared from the window, the part of the
Liberal crowd that was not engaged in hand-to-hand fights with their
enemies--the Tories--made a rush to the front entrance of the Town
Hall, where Sweater's carriage was waiting, and as soon as he had
placed his plump rotundity inside, they took the horses out and amid
frantic cheers harnessed themselves to it instead and dragged it
through the mud and the pouring rain all the way to 'The Cave'--most of
them were accustomed to acting as beasts of burden--where he again
addressed a few words to them from the porch.Afterwards as they walked home saturated with rain and covered from
head to foot with mud, they said it was a great victory for the cause
of progress!Chapter 49

The Undesired


That evening about seven o'clock, whilst Easton was down-town seeing
the last of the election, Ruth's child was born.After the doctor was gone, Mary Linden stayed with her during the hours
that elapsed before Easton came home, and downstairs Elsie and
Charley--who were allowed to stay up late to help their mother because
Mrs Easton was ill--crept about very quietly, and conversed in hushed
tones as they washed up the tea things and swept the floor and tidied
the kitchen.Easton did not return until after midnight, and all through the
intervening hours, Ruth, weak and tired, but unable to sleep, was lying
in bed with the child by her side.Her wide-open eyes appeared
unnaturally large and brilliant, in contrast with the almost death-like
paleness of her face, and there was a look of fear in them, as she
waited and listened for the sound of Easton's footsteps.Outside, the silence of the night was disturbed by many unusual noises:
a far-off roar, as of the breaking of waves on a seashore, arose from
the direction of the town, where the last scenes of the election were
being enacted.Every few minutes motor cars rushed past the house at a
furious rate, and the air was full of the sounds of distant shouts and
singing.Ruth listened and started nervously at every passing footstep.Those
who can imagine the kind of expression there would be upon the face of
a hunted thief, who, finding himself encompassed and brought to bay by
his pursuers, looks wildly around in a vain search for some way of
escape, may be able to form some conception of the terror-stricken way
in which she listened to every sound that penetrated into the stillness
of the dimly lighted room.And ever and again, when her wandering
glance reverted to the frail atom of humanity nestling by her side, her
brows contracted and her eyes filled with bitter tears, as she weakly
reached out her trembling hand to adjust its coverings, faintly
murmuring, with quivering lips and a bursting heart, some words of
endearment and pity.And then--alarmed by the footsteps of some chance
passerby, or by the closing of the door of a neighbouring house, and
fearing that it was the sound she had been waiting for and dreading
through all those weary hours, she would turn in terror to Mary Linden,
sitting in the chair at the bedside, sewing by the light of the shaded
lamp, and take hold of her arm as if seeking protection from some
impending danger.It was after twelve o'clock when Easton came home.Ruth recognized his
footsteps before he reached the house, and her heart seemed to stop
beating when she heard the clang of the gate, as it closed after he had
passed through.It had been Mary's intention to withdraw before he came into the room,
but the sick woman clung to her in such evident fear, and entreated her
so earnestly not to go away, that she remained.It was with a feeling of keen disappointment that Easton noticed how
Ruth shrank away from him, for he had expected and hoped, that after
this, they would be good friends once more; but he tried to think that
it was because she was ill, and when she would not let him touch the
child lest he should awaken it, he agreed without question.The next day, and for the greater part of the time during the next
fortnight, Ruth was in a raging fever.There were intervals when
although weak and exhausted, she was in her right mind, but most of the
time she was quite unconscious of her surroundings and often delirious.Mrs Owen came every day to help to look after her, because Mary just
then had a lot of needlework to do, and consequently could only give
part of her time to Ruth, who, in her delirium, lived and told over and
over again all the sorrow and suffering of the last few months.And so
the two friends, watching by her bedside, learned her dreadful secret.Sometimes--in her delirium--she seemed possessed of an intense and
terrible loathing for the poor little creature she had brought into the
world, and was with difficulty prevented from doing it violence.Once
she seized it cruelly and threw it fiercely from her to the foot of the
bed, as if it had been some poisonous or loathsome thing.And so it
often became necessary to take the child away out of the room, so that
she could not see or hear it, but when her senses came back to her, her
first thought was for the child, and there must have been in her mind
some faint recollection of what she had said and done in her madness,
for when she saw that the baby was not in its accustomed place her
distress and alarm were painful to see, as she entreated them with
tears to give it back to her.And then she would kiss and fondle it
with all manner of endearing words, and cry bitterly.Easton did not see or hear most of this; he only knew that she was very
ill; for he went out every day on the almost hopeless quest for work.Rushton's had next to nothing to do, and most of the other shops were
in a similar plight.Dauber and Botchit had one or two jobs going on,
and Easton tried several times to get a start for them, but was always
told they were full up.The sweating methods of this firm continued to
form a favourite topic of conversation with the unemployed workmen, who
railed at and cursed them horribly.It had leaked out that they were
paying only sixpence an hour to most of the skilled workmen in their
employment, and even then the conditions under which they worked were,
if possible, worse than those obtaining at most other firms.The men
were treated like so many convicts, and every job was a hell where
driving and bullying reigned supreme, and obscene curses and blasphemy
polluted the air from morning till night.The resentment of those who
were out of work was directed, not only against the heads of the firm,
but also against the miserable, half-starved drudges in their
employment.These poor wretches were denounced as'scabs' and
'wastrels' by the unemployed workmen but all the same, whenever Dauber
and Botchit wanted some extra hands they never had any difficulty in
obtaining them, and it often happened that those who had been loudest
and bitterest in their denunciations were amongst the first to rush off
eagerly to apply there for a job whenever there was a chance of getting
one.Frequently the light was seen burning late at night in Rushton's
office, where Nimrod and his master were figuring out prices and
writing out estimates, cutting down the amounts to the lowest possible
point in the hope of underbidding their rivals.Now and then they were
successful but whether they secured the work or not, Nimrod always
appeared equally miserable.If they got the 'job' it often showed such
a small margin of profit that Rushton used to grumble at him and
suggest mismanagement.If their estimates were too high and they lost
the work, he used to demand of Nimrod why it was possible for Dauber
and Botchit to do work so much more cheaply.As the unemployed workmen stood in groups at the corners or walked
aimlessly about the streets, they often saw Hunter pass by on his
bicycle, looking worried and harassed.He was such a picture of
misery, that it began to be rumoured amongst the men, that he had never
been the same since the time he had that fall off the bike; and some of
them declared, that they wouldn't mind betting that ole Misery would
finish up by going off his bloody rocker.At intervals--whenever a job came in--Owen, Crass, Slyme, Sawkins and
one or two others, continued to be employed at Rushton's, but they
seldom managed to make more than two or three days a week, even when
there was anything to do.Chapter 50

Sundered


During the next few weeks Ruth continued very ill.Although the
delirium had left her and did not return, her manner was still very
strange, and it was remarkable that she slept but little and at long
intervals.Mrs Owen came to look after her every day, not going back
to her own home till the evening.Frankie used to call for her as he
came out of school and then they used to go home together, taking
little Freddie Easton with them also, for his own mother was not able
to look after him and Mary Linden had so much other work to do.On Wednesday evening, when the child was about five weeks old, as Mrs
Owen was wishing her good night, Ruth took hold of her hand and after
saying how grateful she was for all that she had done, she asked
whether--supposing anything happened to herself--Nora would promise to
take charge of Freddie for Easton.Owen's wife gave the required
promise, at the same time affecting to regard the supposition as
altogether unlikely, and assuring her that she would soon be better,
but she secretly wondered why Ruth had not mentioned the other child as
well.Nora went away about five o'clock, leaving Ruth's bedroom door open so
that Mrs Linden could hear her call if she needed anything.About a
quarter of an hour after Nora and the two children had gone, Mary
Linden went upstairs to see Ruth, who appeared to have fallen fast
asleep; so she returned to her needlework downstairs.The weather had
been very cloudy all day, there had been rain at intervals and it was a
dark evening, so dark that she had to light the lamp to see her work.Charley sat on the hearthrug in front of the fire repairing one of the
wheels of a wooden cart that he had made with the assistance of another
boy, and Elsie busied herself preparing the tea.Easton was not yet home; Rushton & Co.had a few jobs to do and he had
been at work since the previous Thursday.The place where he was
working was some considerable distance away, so it was nearly half past
six when he came home.They heard him at the gate and at her mother's
direction Elsie went quickly to the front door, which was ajar, to ask
him to walk as quietly as possible so as not to wake Ruth.Mary had prepared the table for his tea in the kitchen, where there was
a bright fire with the kettle singing on the hob.He lit the lamp and
after removing his hat and overcoat, put the kettle on the fire and
while he was waiting for it to boil he went softly upstairs.There was
no lamp burning in the bedroom and the place would have been in utter
darkness but for the red glow of the fire, which did not dispel the
prevailing obscurity sufficiently to enable him to discern the
different objects in the room distinctly.The intense silence that
reigned struck him with a sudden terror.He crossed swiftly over to
the bed and a moment's examination sufficed to tell him that it was
empty.He called her name, but there was no answer, and a hurried
search only made it certain that she was nowhere in the house.Mrs Linden now remembered what Owen's wife had told her of the strange
request that Ruth had made, and as she recounted it to Easton, his
fears became intensified a thousandfold.He was unable to form any
opinion of the reason of her going or of where she had gone, as he
rushed out to seek for her.Almost unconsciously he directed his steps
to Owen's house, and afterwards the two men went to every place where
they thought it possible she might have gone, but without finding any
trace of her.Her father lived a short distance outside the town, and this was one of
the first places they went to, although Easton did not think it likely
she would go there, for she had not been on friendly terms with her
stepmother, and as he had anticipated, it was a fruitless journey.They sought for her in every conceivable place, returning often to
Easton's house to see if she had come home, but they found no trace of
her, nor met anyone who had seen her, which was, perhaps, because the
dreary, rain-washed streets were deserted by all except those whose
business compelled them to be out.About eleven o'clock Nora was standing at the front door waiting for
Owen and Easton, when she thought she could discern a woman's figure in
the shadow of the piers of the gate opposite.It was an unoccupied
house with a garden in front, and the outlines of the bushes it
contained were so vague in the darkness that it was impossible to be
certain; but the longer she looked the more convinced she became that
there was someone there.At last she summoned sufficient courage to
cross over the road, and as she nervously drew near the gate it became
evident that she had not been mistaken.There was a woman standing
there--a woman with a child in her arms, leaning against one of the
pillars and holding the iron bars of the gate with her left hand.Nora recognized her even in the semi-darkness.Her attitude
was one of extreme exhaustion, and as Nora touched her, she perceived
that she was wet through and trembling; but although she was almost
fainting with fatigue she would not consent to go indoors until
repeatedly assured that Easton was not there, and that Nora would not
let him see her if he came.And when at length she yielded and went
into the house she would not sit down or take off her hat or jacket
until--crouching on the floor beside Nora's chair with her face hidden
in the latter's lap--she had sobbed out her pitiful confession, the
same things that she had unwittingly told to the same hearer so often
before during the illness, the only fact that was new was the account
of her wanderings that night.She cried so bitterly and looked so forlorn and heartbroken and ashamed
as she faltered out her woeful story; so consumed with
self-condemnation, making no excuse for herself except to repeat over
and over again that she had never meant to do wrong, that Nora could
not refrain from weeping also as she listened.It appeared that, unable to bear the reproach that Easton's presence
seemed to imply, or to endure the burden of her secret any longer, and
always haunted by the thought of the lake in the park, Ruth had formed
the dreadful resolution of taking her own life and the child's.When
she arrived at the park gates they were closed and locked for the night
but she remembered that there was another means of entering--the place
at the far end of the valley where the park was not fenced in, so she
had gone there--nearly three miles--only to find that railings had
recently been erected and therefore it was no longer possible to get
into the park by that way.And then, when she found it impossible to
put her resolve into practice, she had realized for the first time the
folly and wickedness of the act she had meant to commit.But although
she had abandoned her first intention, she said she could never go home
again; she would take a room somewhere and get some work to do, or
perhaps she might be able to get a situation where they would allow her
to have the child with her, or failing that she would work and pay
someone to look after it; but she could never go home any more.If she
only had somewhere to stay for a few days until she could get something
to do, she was sure she would be able to earn her living, but she could
not go back home; she felt that she would rather walk about the streets
all night than go there again.It was arranged that Ruth should have the small apartment which had
been Frankie's playroom, the necessary furniture being obtained from a
second-hand shop close by.Easton did not learn the real reason of her
flight until three days afterwards.At first he attributed it to a
recurrence of the mental disorder that she had suffered from after the
birth of the child, and he had been glad to leave her at Owen's place
in Nora's care, but on the evening of the third day when he returned
home from work, he found a letter in Ruth's handwriting which told him
all there was to tell.When he recovered from the stupefaction into which he was thrown by the
perusal of this letter, his first thought was to seek out Slyme, but he
found upon inquiring that the latter had left the town the previous
morning.Slyme's landlady said he had told her that he had been
offered several months' work in London, which he had accepted.The
truth was that Slyme had heard of Ruth's flight--nearly everyone knew
about it as a result of the inquiries that had been made for her--and,
guessing the cause, he had prudently cleared out.Easton made no attempt to see Ruth, but he went to Owen's and took
Freddie away, saying he would pay Mrs Linden to look after the child
whilst he was at work.His manner was that of a deeply injured
man--the possibility that he was in any way to blame for what had
happened did not seem to occur to his mind at all.As for Ruth she made no resistance to his taking the child away from
her, although she cried about it in secret.She got some work a few
days afterwards--helping the servants at one of the large
boarding-houses on the Grand Parade.Nora looked after the baby for her while she was at work, an
arrangement that pleased Frankie vastly; he said it was almost as good
as having a baby of their very own.For the first few weeks after Ruth went away Easton tried to persuade
himself that he did not very much regret what had happened.Mrs Linden
looked after Freddie, and Easton tried to believe that he would really
be better off now that he had only himself and the child to provide for.At first, whenever he happened to meet Owen, they used to speak of
Ruth, or to be more correct, Easton used to speak of her; but one day
when the two men were working together Owen had expressed himself
rather offensively.He seemed to think that Easton was more to blame
than she was; and afterwards they avoided the subject, although Easton
found it difficult to avoid the thoughts the other man's words
suggested.Now and then he heard of Ruth and learnt that she was still working at
the same place; and once he met her suddenly and unexpectedly in the
street.They passed each other hurriedly and he did not see the
scarlet flush that for an instant dyed her face, nor the deathly pallor
that succeeded it.He never went to Owen's place or sent any communication to Ruth, nor
did she ever send him any; but although Easton did not know it she
frequently saw Freddie, for when Elsie Linden took the child out she
often called to see Mrs Owen.As time went on and the resentment he had felt towards her lost its
first bitterness, Easton began to think there was perhaps some little
justification for what Owen had said, and gradually there grew within
him an immense desire for reconciliation--to start afresh and to forget
all that had happened; but the more he thought of this the more
hopeless and impossible of realization it seemed.Although perhaps he was not conscious of it, this desire arose solely
from selfish motives.The money he earned seemed to melt away almost
as soon as he received it; to his surprise he found that he was not
nearly so well off in regard to personal comfort as he had been
formerly, and the house seemed to grow more dreary and desolate as the
wintry days dragged slowly by.Sometimes--when he had the money--he
sought forgetfulness in the society of Crass and the other frequenters
of the Cricketers, but somehow or other he could not take the same
pleasure in the conversation of these people as formerly, when he had
found it--as he now sometimes wondered to remember--so entertaining as
to almost make him forget Ruth's existence.One evening about three weeks before Christmas, as he and Owen were
walking homewards together from work, Easton reverted for the first
time to their former conversation.He spoke with a superior air: his
manner and tone indicating that he thought he was behaving with great
generosity.He would be willing to forgive her and have her back, he
said, if she would come: but he would never be able to tolerate the
child.Of course it might be sent to an orphanage or some similar
institution, but he was afraid Ruth would never consent to that, and he
knew that her stepmother would not take it.'If you can persuade her to return to you, we'll take the child,' said
Owen.'Do you think your wife would be willing?'We thought it a possible way for you, and my wife would
like to have the child.''But would you be able to afford it?''Of course,' said Easton, 'if Slyme comes back he might agree to pay
something for its keep.'After a long pause Easton continued: 'Would you mind asking Mrs Owen to
suggest it to Ruth?''If you like I'll get her to suggest it--as a message from you.''What I meant,' said Easton hesitatingly, 'was that your wife might
just suggest it--casual like--and advise her that it would be the best
way, and then you could let me know what Ruth said.''No,' replied Owen, unable any longer to control his resentment of the
other's manner, 'as things stand now, if it were not for the other
child, I should advise her to have nothing further to do with you.You
seem to think that you are acting a very generous part in being
"willing" to have her back, but she's better off now than she was with
you.I see no reason--except for the other child--why she should go
back to you.As far as I understand it, you had a good wife and you
ill-treated her.'I never raised my hand to her--at least only
once, and then I didn't hurt her.'Oh no: from what my wife tells me she only blames herself, but I'm
drawing my own conclusions.You may not have struck her, but you did
worse--you treated her with indifference and exposed her to temptation.What has happened is the natural result of your neglect and want of
care for her.The responsibility for what has happened is mainly
yours, but apparently you wish to pose now as being very generous and
to "forgive her"--you're "willing" to take her back; but it seems to me
that it would be more fitting that you should ask her to forgive you.'Easton made no answer and after a long silence the other continued:

'I would not advise her to go back to you on such terms as you seem to
think right, because if you became reconciled on such terms I don't
think either of you could be happy.Your only chance of happiness is
to realize that you have both done wrong; that each of you has
something to forgive; to forgive and never speak of it again.'Easton made no reply and a few minutes afterwards, their ways
diverging, they wished each other 'Good night'.They were working for Rushton--painting the outside of a new
conservatory at Mr Sweater's house, 'The Cave'.This job was finished
the next day and at four o'clock the boy brought the handcart, which
they loaded with their ladders and other materials.They took these
back to the yard and then, as it was Friday night, they went up to the
front shop and handed in their time sheets.Afterwards, as they were
about to separate, Easton again referred to the subject of their
conversation of the previous evening.He had been very reserved and
silent all day, scarcely uttering a word except when the work they had
been engaged in made it necessary to do so, and there was now a sort of
catch in his voice as he spoke.'I've been thinking over what you said last night; it's quite true.I wrote to Ruth last night and
admitted it to her.I'll take it as a favour if you and your wife will
say what you can to help me get her back.'Owen stretched out his hand and as the other took it, said: 'You may
rely on us both to do our best.'Chapter 51

The Widow's Son


The next morning when they went to the yard at half past eight o'clock
Hunter told them that there was nothing to do, but that they had better
come on Monday in case some work came in.They accordingly went on the
Monday, and Tuesday and Wednesday, but as nothing 'came in' of course
they did not do any work.On Thursday morning the weather was dark and
bitterly cold.The sky presented an unbroken expanse of dull grey and
a keen north wind swept through the cheerless streets.Owen--who had
caught cold whilst painting the outside of the conservatory at
Sweater's house the previous week--did not get to the yard until ten
o'clock.He felt so ill that he would not have gone at all if they had
not needed the money he would be able to earn if there was anything to
do.Strange though it may appear to the advocates of thrift, although
he had been so fortunate as to be in employment when so many others
were idle, they had not saved any money.On the contrary, during all
the summer they had not been able to afford to have proper food or
clothing.Every week most of the money went to pay arrears of rent or
some other debts, so that even whilst he was at work they had often to
go without some of the necessaries of life.They had broken boots,
shabby, insufficient clothing, and barely enough to eat.The weather had become so bitterly cold that, fearing he would be laid
up if he went without it any longer, he took his overcoat out of pawn,
and that week they had to almost starve.Not that it was much better
other weeks, for lately he had only been making six and a half hours a
day--from eight-thirty in the morning till four o'clock in the evening,
and on Saturday only four and a half hours--from half past eight till
one.This made his wages--at sevenpence an hour--twenty-one shillings
and sevenpence a week--that is, when there was work to do every day,
which was not always.Sometimes they had to stand idle three days out
of six.The wages of those who got sixpence halfpenny came out at one
pound and twopence--when they worked every day--and as for those
who--like Sawkins--received only fivepence, their week's wages amounted
to fifteen and sixpence.When they were only employed for two or three days or perhaps only a
few hours, their 'Saturday night' sometimes amounted to half a
sovereign, seven and sixpence, five shillings or even less.Then most
of them said that it was better than nothing at all.Many of them were married men, so, in order to make existence possible,
their wives went out charing or worked in laundries.They had children
whom they had to bring up for the most part on'skim' milk, bread,
margarine, and adulterated tea.Many of these children--little mites
of eight or nine years--went to work for two or three hours in the
morning before going to school; the same in the evening after school,
and all day on Saturday, carrying butchers' trays loaded with meat,
baskets of groceries and vegetables, cans of paraffin oil, selling or
delivering newspapers, and carrying milk.As soon as they were old
enough they got Half Time certificates and directly they were fourteen
they left school altogether and went to work all the day.When they
were old enough some of them tried to join the Army or Navy, but were
found physically unfit.It is not much to be wondered at that when they became a little older
they were so degenerate intellectually that they imagined that the
surest way to obtain better conditions would be to elect gangs of
Liberal and Tory land-grabbers, sweaters, swindlers and lawyers to rule
over them.When Owen arrived at the yard he found Bert White cleaning out the
dirty pots in the paint-shop.The noise he made with the scraping
knife prevented him from hearing Owen's approach and the latter stood
watching him for some minutes without speaking.The stone floor of the
paint shop was damp and shiny and the whole place was chilly as a tomb.The boy was trembling with cold and he looked pitifully undersized and
frail as he bent over his work with an old apron girt about him.Because it was so cold he was wearing his jacket with the ends of the
sleeves turned back to keep them clean, or to prevent them getting any
dirtier, for they were already in the same condition as the rest of his
attire, which was thickly encrusted with dried paint of many colours,
and his hands and fingernails were grimed with it.As he watched the poor boy bending over his task, Owen thought of
Frankie, and with a feeling akin to terror wondered whether he would
ever be in a similar plight.When he saw Owen, the boy left off working and wished him good morning,
remarking that it was very cold.There's lots of wood lying about the
yard.'Misery
wouldn't 'arf ramp if 'e caught me at it.I used to 'ave a fire 'ere
last winter till Rushton found out, and 'e kicked up an orful row and
told me to move meself and get some work done and then I wouldn't feel
the cold.''Oh, he said that, did he?'said Owen, his pale face becoming suddenly
suffused with blood.He went out into the yard and crossing over to where--under a
shed--there was a great heap of waste wood, stuff that had been taken
out of places where Rushton & Co.had made alterations, he gathered an
armful of it and was returning to the paintshop when Sawkins accosted
him.'You mustn't go burnin' any of that, you know!That's all got to be
saved and took up to the bloke's house.Misery spoke about it only
this mornin'.'He carried the wood into the shop and after
throwing it into the fireplace he poured some old paint over it, and,
applying a match, produced a roaring fire.Then he brought in several
more armfuls of wood and piled them in a corner of the shop.Bert took
no part in these proceedings, and at first rather disapproved of them
because he was afraid there would be trouble when Misery came, but when
the fire was an accomplished fact he warmed his hands and shifted his
work to the other side of the bench so as to get the benefit of the
heat.Owen waited for about half an hour to see if Hunter would return, but
as that disciple did not appear, he decided not to wait any longer.Before leaving he gave Bert some instructions:

'Keep up the fire with all the old paint that you can scrape off those
things and any other old paint or rubbish that's here, and whenever it
grows dull put more wood on.There's a lot of old stuff here that's of
no use except to be thrown away or burnt.If Hunter says
anything, tell him that I lit the fire, and that I told you to keep it
burning.If you want more wood, go out and take it.'On his way out Owen spoke to Sawkins.His manner was so menacing, his
face so pale, and there was such a strange glare in his eyes, that the
latter thought of the talk there had been about Owen being mad, and
felt half afraid of him.'I am going to the office to see Rushton; if Hunter comes here, you say
I told you to tell him that if I find the boy in that shop again
without a fire, I'll report it to the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children.And as for you, if the boy comes out here to get
more wood, don't you attempt to interfere with him.''I don't want to interfere with the bloody kid,' grunted Sawkins.'It
seems to me as if he's gorn orf 'is bloody crumpet,' he added as he
watched Owen walking rapidly down the street.'I can't understand why
people can't mind their own bloody business: anyone would think the boy
belonged to 'IM.'That was just how the matter presented itself to Owen.The idea that
it was his own child who was to be treated in this way possessed and
infuriated him as he strode savagely along.In the vicinity of the
Slave Market on the Grand Parade he passed--without seeing
them--several groups of unemployed artisans whom he knew.Some of them
were offended and remarked that he was getting stuck up, but others,
observing how strange he looked, repeated the old prophecy that one of
these days Owen would go out of his mind.As he drew near to his destination large flakes of snow began to fall.He walked so rapidly and was in such a fury that by the time he reached
the shop he was scarcely able to speak.'Is--Hunter--or Rushton here?''Hunter isn't, but the guv'nor is.'He'll soon--know--that,' panted Owen as he strode up to the office
door, and without troubling to knock, flung it violently open and
entered.The atmosphere of this place was very different from that of the damp
cellar where Bert was working.A grate fitted with asbestos blocks and
lit with gas communicated a genial warmth to the air.Rushton was standing leaning over Miss Wade's chair with his left arm
round her neck.Owen recollected afterwards that her dress was
disarranged.She retired hastily to the far end of the room as Rushton
jumped away from her, and stared in amazement and confusion at the
intruder--he was too astonished and embarrassed to speak.Owen stood
panting and quivering in the middle of the office and pointed a
trembling finger at his employer:

'I've come--here--to tell--you--that--if I find young--Bert
White--working--down in that shop--without a fire--I'll have you
prosecuted.The place is not good enough for a stable--if you owned a
valuable dog--you wouldn't keep it there--I give you fair warning--I
know--enough--about you--to put you--where you deserve to be--if you
don't treat him better I'll have you punished I'll show you up.'Rushton continued to stare at him in mingled confusion, fear and
perplexity; he did not yet comprehend exactly what it was all about; he
was guiltily conscious of so many things which he might reasonably fear
to be shown up or prosecuted for if they were known, and the fact of
being caught under such circumstances with Miss Wade helped to reduce
him to a condition approaching terror.'If the boy has been there without a fire, I 'aven't known anything
about it,' he stammered at last.'Mr 'Unter has charge of all those
matters.''You--yourself--forbade him--to make a fire last winter--and
anyhow--you know about it now.You obtained money from his mother
under the pretence--that you were going--to teach him a trade--but for
the last twelve months--you have been using him--as if he were--a beast
of burden.I advise you to see to it--or I shall--find--means--to make
you--wish you had done so.'With this Owen turned and went out, leaving the door open, and Rushton
in a state of mind compounded of fear, amazement and anger.As he walked homewards through the snow-storm, Owen began to realize
that the consequence of what he had done would be that Rushton would
not give him any more work, and as he reflected on all that this would
mean to those at home, for a moment he doubted whether he had done
right.But when he told Nora what had happened she said there were
plenty of other firms in the town who would employ him--when they had
the work.He had done without Rushton before and could do so again;
for her part--whatever the consequences might be--she was glad that he
had acted as he did.'We'll get through somehow, I suppose,' said Owen, wearily.'There's
not much chance of getting a job anywhere else just now, but I shall
try to get some work on my own account.I shall do some samples of
show-cards the same as I did last winter and try to get orders from
some of the shops--they usually want something extra at this time, but
I'm afraid it is rather too late: most of them already have all they
want.''I shouldn't go out again today if I were you,' said Nora, noticing how
ill he looked.'You should stay at home and read, or write up those
minutes.'The minutes referred to were those of the last meeting of the local
branch of the Painters' Society, of which Owen was the secretary, and
as the snow continued to fall, he occupied himself after dinner in the
manner his wife suggested, until four o'clock, when Frankie returned
from school bringing with him a large snowball, and crying out as a
piece of good news that the snow was still falling heavily, and that he
believed it was freezing!They went to bed very early that night, for it was necessary to
economize the coal, and not only that, but--because the rooms were so
near the roof--it was not possible to keep the place warm no matter how
much coal was used.The fire seemed, if anything, to make the place
colder, for it caused the outer air to pour in through the joints of
the ill-fitting doors and windows.Owen lay awake for the greater part of the night.The terror of the
future made rest or sleep impossible.He got up very early the next
morning--long before it was light--and after lighting the fire, set
about preparing the samples he had mentioned to Nora, but found that it
would not be possible to do much in this direction without buying more
cardboard, for most of what he had was not in good condition.They had bread and butter and tea for breakfast.Frankie had his in
bed and it was decided to keep him away from school until after dinner
because the weather was so very cold and his only pair of boots were so
saturated with moisture from having been out in the snow the previous
day.'I shall make a few inquiries to see if there's any other work to be
had before I buy the cardboard,' said Owen, 'although I'm afraid it's
not much use.'Just as he was preparing to go out, the front door bell rang, and as he
was going down to answer it he saw Bert White coming upstairs.The boy
was carrying a flat, brown-paper parcel under his arm.'A corfin plate,' he explained as he arrived at the door.'Wanted at
once--Misery ses you can do it at 'ome, an' I've got to wait for it.'Owen and his wife looked at each other with intense relief.So he was
not to be dismissed after all.'There's a piece of paper inside the parcel with the name of the party
what's dead,' continued Bert, 'and here's a little bottle of Brunswick
black for you to do the inscription with.''Yes: he told me to tell you there's a job to be started Monday
morning--a couple of rooms to be done out somewhere.Got to be
finished by Thursday; and there's another job 'e wants you to do this
afternoon--after dinner--so you've got to come to the yard at one
o'clock.'E told me to tell you 'e meant to leave a message for you
yesterday morning, but 'e forgot.''What did he say to you about the fire--anything?''Yes: they both of 'em came about an hour after you went away--Misery
and the Bloke too--but they didn't kick up a row.I wasn't arf
frightened, I can tell you, when I saw 'em both coming, but they was
quite nice.The Bloke ses to me, "Ah, that's right, my boy," 'e ses.I'm going to send you some coke," 'e ses.And
then they 'ad a look round and 'e told Sawkins to put some new panes of
glass where the winder was broken, and--you know that great big
packing-case what was under the truck shed?''Well, 'e told Sawkins to saw it up and cover over the stone floor of
the paint-shop with it.It ain't 'arf all right there now.I've
cleared out all the muck from under the benches and we've got two sacks
of coke sent from the gas-works, and the Bloke told me when that's all
used up I've got to get a order orf Miss Wade for another lot.'At one o'clock Owen was at the yard, where he saw Misery, who
instructed him to go to the front shop and paint some numbers on the
racks where the wallpapers were stored.Whilst he was doing this work
Rushton came in and greeted him in a very friendly way.'I'm very glad you let me know about the boy working in that
paint-shop,' he observed after a few preliminary remarks.'I can
assure you as I don't want the lad to be uncomfortable, but you know I
can't attend to everything myself.I'm much obliged to you for telling
me about it; I think you did quite right; I should have done the same
myself.'Owen did not know what to reply, but Rushton walked off without
waiting...



Chapter 52

'It's a Far, Far Better Thing that I do, than I have Ever Done'


Although Owen, Easton and Crass and a few others were so lucky as to
have had a little work to do during the last few months, the majority
of their fellow workmen had been altogether out of employment most of
the time, and meanwhile the practical business-men, and the pretended
disciples of Christ--the liars and hypocrites who professed to believe
that all men are brothers and God their Father--had continued to enact
the usual farce that they called 'Dealing' with the misery that
surrounded them on every side.They continued to organize 'Rummage'
and 'Jumble' sales and bazaars, and to distribute their rotten cast-off
clothes and boots and their broken victuals and soup to such of the
Brethren as were sufficiently degraded to beg for them.The beautiful
Distress Committee was also in full operation; over a thousand Brethren
had registered themselves on its books.Of this number--after careful
investigation--the committee had found that no fewer than six hundred
and seventy-two were deserving of being allowed to work for their
living.The Committee would probably have given these six hundred and
seventy-two the necessary permission, but it was somewhat handicapped
by the fact that the funds at its disposal were only sufficient to
enable that number of Brethren to be employed for about three days.However, by adopting a policy of temporizing, delay, and general artful
dodging, the Committee managed to create the impression that they were
Dealing with the Problem.If it had not been for a cunning device invented by Brother Rushton, a
much larger number of the Brethren would have succeeded in registering
themselves as unemployed on the books of the Committee.In previous
years it had been the practice to issue an application form called a
'Record Paper' to any Brother who asked for one, and the Brother
returned it after filling it in himself.At a secret meeting of the
Committee Rushton proposed--amid laughter and applause, it was such a
good joke--a new and better way, calculated to keep down the number of
applicants.The result of this innovation was that no more forms were
issued, but the applicants for work were admitted into the office one
at a time, and were there examined by a junior clerk, somewhat after
the manner of a French Juge d'Instruction interrogating a criminal, the
clerk filling in the form according to the replies of the culprit.'Where did you live before you went there?''How long were you living at that place?''Did you owe any rent when you left?''What is your Trade, Calling, Employment, or Occupation?''Are you Married or single or a Widower or what?''What kind of a house do you live in?'What have you been doing for the last five years?What kind of work,
how many hours a day?'Give the full names and addresses of all the different employers you
have worked for during the last five years, and the reasons why you
left them?''Give the names of all the foremen you have worked under during the
last five years?''Do you get any money from any Club or Society, or from any Charity, or
from any other source?''Have you ever worked for a Distress Committee before?''Have you ever done any other kinds of work than those you have
mentioned?Do you think you would be fit for any other kind?When the criminal had answered all the questions, and when his answers
had all been duly written down, he was informed that a member of the
Committee, or an Authorized Officer, or some Other Person, would in due
course visit his home and make inquiries about him, after which the
Authorized Officer or Other Person would make a report to the
Committee, who would consider it at their next meeting.As the interrogation of each criminal occupied about half an hour, to
say nothing of the time he was kept waiting, it will be seen that as a
means of keeping down the number of registered unemployed the idea
worked splendidly.When Rushton introduced this new rule it was carried unanimously, Dr
Weakling being the only dissentient, but of course he--as Brother
Grinder remarked--was always opposed to any sensible proposal.There
was one consolation, however, Grinder added, they was not likely to be
pestered with 'im much longer; the first of November was coming and if
he--Grinder--knowed anything of working men they was sure to give
Weakling the dirty kick out directly they got the chance.A few days afterwards the result of the municipal election justified
Brother Grinder's prognostications, for the working men voters of Dr
Weakling's ward did give him the dirty kick out: but Rushton, Didlum,
Grinder and several other members of the band were triumphantly
returned with increased majorities.Mr Dauber, of Dauber and Botchit, had already been elected a Guardian
of the Poor.During all this time Hunter, who looked more worried and miserable as
the dreary weeks went by, was occupied every day in supervising what
work was being done and in running about seeking for more.Nearly
every night he remained at the office until a late hour, poring over
specifications and making out estimates.The police had become so
accustomed to seeing the light in the office that as a rule they took
no notice of it, but one Thursday night--exactly one week after the
scene between Owen and Rushton about the boy--the constable on the beat
observed the light there much later than usual.At first he paid no
particular attention to the fact, but when night merged into morning
and the light still remained, his curiosity was aroused.He knocked at the door, but no one came in answer, and no sound
disturbed the deathlike stillness that reigned within.The door was
locked, but he was not able to tell whether it had been closed from the
inside or outside, because it had a spring latch.The office window
was low down, but it was not possible to see in because the back of the
glass had been painted.The constable thought that the most probable explanation of the mystery
was that whoever had been there earlier in the evening had forgotten to
turn out the light when they went away; it was not likely that thieves
or anyone who had no business to be there would advertise their
presence by lighting the gas.He made a note of the incident in his pocket-book and was about to
resume his beat when he was joined by his inspector.The latter agreed
that the conclusion arrived at by the constable was probably the right
one and they were about to pass on when the inspector noticed a small
speck of light shining through the lower part of the painted window,
where a small piece of the paint had either been scratched or had
shelled off the glass.He knelt down and found that it was possible to
get a view of the interior of the office, and as he peered through he
gave a low exclamation.When he made way for his subordinate to look
in his turn, the constable was with some difficulty able to distinguish
the figure of a man lying prone upon the floor.It was an easy task for the burly policeman to force open the office
door: a single push of his shoulder wrenched it from its fastenings and
as it flew back the socket of the lock fell with a splash into a great
pool of blood that had accumulated against the threshold, flowing from
the place where Hunter was lying on his back, his arms extended and his
head nearly severed from his body.On the floor, close to his right
hand, was an open razor.An overturned chair lay on the floor by the
side of the table where he usually worked, the table itself being
littered with papers and drenched with blood.Within the next few days Crass resumed the role he had played when
Hunter was ill during the summer, taking charge of the work and
generally doing his best to fill the dead man's place, although--as he
confided to certain of his cronies in the bar of the Cricketers--he had
no intention of allowing Rushton to do the same as Hunter had done.One of his first jobs--on the morning after the discovery of the
body--was to go with Mr Rushton to look over a house where some work
was to be done for which an estimate had to be given.It was this
estimate that Hunter had been trying to make out the previous evening
in the office, for they found that the papers on his table were covered
with figures and writing relating to this work.These papers justified
the subsequent verdict of the Coroner's jury that Hunter committed
suicide in a fit of temporary insanity, for they were covered with a
lot of meaningless scribbling, the words wrongly spelt and having no
intelligible connection with each other.There was one sum that he had
evidently tried repeatedly to do correctly, but which came wrong in a
different way every time.The fact that he had the razor in his
possession seemed to point to his having premeditated the act, but this
was accounted for at the inquest by the evidence of the last person who
saw him alive, a hairdresser, who stated that Hunter had left the razor
with him to be sharpened a few days previously and that he had called
for it on the evening of the tragedy.He had ground this razor for Mr
Hunter several times before.Crass took charge of all the arrangements for the funeral.He bought a
new second-hand pair of black trousers at a cast-off clothing shop in
honour of the occasion, and discarded his own low-crowned silk
hat--which was getting rather shabby--in favour of Hunter's tall one,
which he found in the office and annexed without hesitation or scruple.It was rather large for him, but he put some folded strips of paper
inside the leather lining.Crass was a proud man as he walked in
Hunter's place at the head of the procession, trying to look solemn,
but with a half-smile on his fat, pasty face, destitute of colour
except one spot on his chin near his underlip, where there was a small
patch of inflammation about the size of a threepenny piece.This spot
had been there for a very long time.At first--as well as he could
remember--it was only a small pimple, but it had grown larger, with
something the appearance of scurvy.Crass attributed its continuation
to the cold having 'got into it last winter'.It was rather strange,
too, because he generally took care of himself when it was cold: he
always wore the warm wrap that had formerly belonged to the old lady
who died of cancer.However, Crass did not worry much about this
little sore place; he just put a little zinc ointment on it
occasionally and had no doubt that it would get well in time.Chapter 53

Barrington Finds a Situation


The revulsion of feeling that Barrington experienced during the
progress of the election was intensified by the final result.The
blind, stupid, enthusiastic admiration displayed by the philanthropists
for those who exploited and robbed them; their extraordinary apathy
with regard to their own interests; the patient, broken-spirited way in
which they endured their sufferings, tamely submitting to live in
poverty in the midst of the wealth they had helped to create; their
callous indifference to the fate of their children, and the savage
hatred they exhibited towards anyone who dared to suggest the
possibility of better things, forced upon him the thought that the
hopes he cherished were impossible of realization.The words of the
renegade Socialist recurred constantly to his mind:

'You can be a Jesus Christ if you like, but for my part I'm finished.For the future I intend to look after myself.As for these people,
they vote for what they want, they get what they vote for, and, by God!They are being beaten with whips of their
own choosing, and if I had my way they should be chastised with
scorpions.For them, the present system means joyless drudgery,
semi-starvation, rags and premature death; and they vote for it and
uphold it.Let them drudge and let
them starve!'These words kept ringing in his ears as he walked through the crowded
streets early one fine evening a few days before Christmas.The shops
were all brilliantly lighted for the display of their Christmas stores,
and the pavements and even the carriageways were thronged with
sightseers.Barrington was specially interested in the groups of shabbily dressed
men and women and children who gathered in the roadway in front of the
poulterers' and butchers' shops, gazing at the meat and the serried
rows of turkeys and geese decorated with  ribbons and rosettes.He knew that to come here and look at these things was the only share
many of these poor people would have of them, and he marvelled greatly
at their wonderful patience and abject resignation.But what struck him most of all was the appearance of many of the
women, evidently working men's wives.Their faded, ill-fitting
garments and the tired, sad expressions on their pale and careworn
faces.Some of them were alone; others were accompanied by little
children who trotted along trustfully clinging to their mothers' hands.The sight of these poor little ones, their utter helplessness and
dependence, their patched unsightly clothing and broken boots, and the
wistful looks on their pitiful faces as they gazed into the windows of
the toy-shops, sent a pang of actual physical pain to his heart and
filled his eyes with tears.He knew that these children--naked of joy
and all that makes life dear--were being tortured by the sight of the
things that were placed so cruelly before their eyes, but which they
were not permitted to touch or to share; and, like Joseph of old, his
heart yearned over his younger brethren.He felt like a criminal because he was warmly clad and well fed in the
midst of all this want and unhappiness, and he flushed with shame
because he had momentarily faltered in his devotion to the noblest
cause that any man could be privileged to fight for--the uplifting of
the disconsolate and the oppressed.He presently came to a large toy shop outside which several children
were standing admiring the contents of the window.He recognized some
of these children and paused to watch them and to listen to their talk.They did not notice him standing behind them as they ranged to and fro
before the window, and as he looked at them, he was reminded of the way
in which captive animals walk up and down behind the bars of their
cages.These children wandered repeatedly, backwards and forwards from
one end of the window to the other, with their little hands pressed
against the impenetrable plate glass, choosing and pointing out to each
other the particular toys that took their fancies.cried Charley Linden, enthusiastically indicating a
large strongly built waggon.'If I had that I'd give Freddie rides in
it and bring home lots of firewood, and we could play at fire engines
as well.''I'd rather have this railway,' said Frankie Owen.'There's a real
tunnel and real coal in the tenders; then there's the station and the
signals and a place to turn the engine round, and a red lantern to
light when there's danger on the line.''Mine's this doll--not the biggest one, the one in pink with clothes
that you can take off,' said Elsie; 'and this tea set; and this
needlecase for Mother.'Little Freddie had let go his hold of Elsie, to whom he usually clung
tightly and was clapping his hands and chuckling with delight and
desire.'But it's no use lookin' at them any longer,' continued Elsie, with a
sigh, as she took hold of Freddie's hand to lead him away.'It's no
use lookin' at 'em any longer; the likes of us can't expect to have
such good things as them.'This remark served to recall Frankie and Charley to the stern realities
of life, and turning reluctantly away from the window they prepared to
follow Elsie, but Freddie had not yet learnt the lesson--he had not
lived long enough to understand that the good things of the world were
not for the likes of him; so when Elsie attempted to draw him away he
pursed up his underlip and began to cry, repeating that he wanted a
gee-gee.The other children clustered round trying to coax and comfort
him by telling him that no one was allowed to have anything out of the
windows yet--until Christmas--and that Santa Claus would be sure to
bring him a gee-gee then; but these arguments failed to make any
impression on Freddie, who tearfully insisted upon being supplied at
once.Whilst they were thus occupied they caught sight of Barrington, whom
they hailed with evident pleasure born of the recollection of certain
gifts of pennies and cakes they had at different times received from
him.'Hello, Mr Barrington,' said the two boys in a breath.'Hello,' replied Barrington, as he patted the baby's cheek.'He wants that there 'orse, mister, the one with the real 'air on,'
said Charley, smiling indulgently like a grown-up person who realized
the absurdity of the demand.'Fweddie want gee-gee,' repeated the child, taking hold of Barrington's
hand and returning to the window.'Tell him that Santa Claus'll bring it to him on Christmas,' whispered
Elsie.'P'raps he'll believe you and that'll satisfy him, and he's
sure to forget all about it in a little while.''Are you still out of work, Mr Barrington?''I've got something to do at last.''Well, that's a good job, ain't it?''And whom do you think I'm working for?'echoed the children, opening their eyes to the fullest
extent.'Yes,' continued Barrington, solemnly.'You know, he is a very old man
now, so old that he can't do all his work himself.Last year he was so
tired that he wasn't able to get round to all the children he wanted to
give things to, and consequently a great many of them never got
anything at all.So this year he's given me a job to help him.He's
given me some money and a list of children's names, and against their
names are written the toys they are to have.My work is to buy the
things and give them to the boys and girls whose names are on the list.'The children listened to this narrative with bated breath.Incredible
as the story seemed, Barrington's manner was so earnest as to almost
compel belief.'Really and truly, or are you only having a game?'said Frankie at
length, speaking almost in a whisper.Elsie and Charley maintained an
awestruck silence, while Freddie beat upon the glass with the palms of
his hands.'Really and truly,' replied Barrington unblushingly as he took out his
pocket-book and turned over the leaves.'I've got the list here;
perhaps your names are down for something.'The three children turned pale and their hearts beat violently as they
listened wide-eyed for what was to follow.'Let me see,' continued Barrington, scanning the pages of the book,
'Why, yes, here they are!Elsie Linden, one doll with clothes that can
be taken off, one tea-set, one needlecase.Freddie Easton, one horse
with real hair.Charley Linden, one four-wheeled waggon full of
groceries.Frankie Owen, one railway with tunnel, station, train with
real coal for engine, signals, red lamp and place to turn the engines
round.'Barrington closed the book: 'So you may as well have your things now,'
he continued, speaking in a matter-of-fact tone.'We'll buy them here;
it will save me a lot of work.I shall not have the trouble of taking
them round to where you live.It's lucky I happened to meet you, isn't
it?'The children were breathless with emotion, but they just managed to
gasp out that it was--very lucky.As they followed him into the shop, Freddie was the only one of the
four whose condition was anything like normal.All the others were in
a half-dazed state.Frankie was afraid that he was not really awake at
all.It couldn't be true; it must be a dream.In addition to the hair, the horse was furnished with four wheels.They
did not have it made into a parcel, but tied some string to it and
handed it over to its new owner.The elder children were scarcely
conscious of what took place inside the shop; they knew that Barrington
was talking to the shopman, but they did not hear what was said--the
sound seemed far away and unreal.The shopman made the doll, the tea-set and the needlecase into one
parcel and gave it to Elsie.The railway, in a stout cardboard box,
was also wrapped up in brown paper, and Frankie's heart nearly burst
when the man put the package into his arms.When they came out of the toy shop they said 'Good night' to Frankie,
who went off carrying his parcel very carefully and feeling as if he
were walking on air.The others went into a provision merchant's near
by, where the groceries were purchased and packed into the waggon.Then Barrington, upon referring to the list to make quite certain that
he had not forgotten anything, found that Santa Claus had put down a
pair of boots each for Elsie and Charley, and when they went to buy
these, it was seen that their stockings were all ragged and full of
holes, so they went to a draper's and bought some stocking also.Barrington said that although they were not on the list, he was sure
Santa Claus would not object--he had probably meant them to have them,
but had forgotten to put them down.Chapter 54

The End


The following evening Barrington called at Owen's place.He said he
was going home for the holidays and had come to say goodbye for a time.Owen had not been doing very well during these last few months,
although he was one of the few lucky ones who had had some small share
of work.Most of the money he earned went for rent, to pay which they
often had to go short of food.Lately his chest had become so bad that
the slightest exertion brought on fits of coughing and breathlessness,
which made it almost impossible to work even when he had the
opportunity; often it was only by an almost superhuman effort of will
that he was able to continue working at all.He contrived to keep up
appearances to a certain extent before Rushton, who, although he knew
that Owen was not so strong as the other men, was inclined to overlook
it so long as he was able to do his share of work, for Owen was a very
useful hand when things were busy.But lately some of the men with
whom he worked began to manifest dissatisfaction at having him for a
mate.When two men are working together, the master expects to see two
men's work done, and if one of the two is not able to do his share it
makes it all the harder for the other.He never had the money to go to a doctor to get advice, but earlier in
the winter he had obtained from Rushton a ticket for the local
hospital.Every Saturday throughout the year when the men were paid
they were expected to put a penny or twopence in the hospital box.Contributions were obtained in this way from every firm and workshop in
the town.The masters periodically handed these boxes over to the
hospital authorities and received in return some tickets which they
gave to anyone who needed and asked for them.The employer had to fill
in the ticket or application form with the name and address of the
applicant, and to certify that in his opinion the individual was a
deserving case,'suitable to receive this charity'.In common with the
majority of workmen, Owen had a sort of horror of going for advice to
this hospital, but he was so ill that he stifled his pride and went.It happened that it turned out to be more expensive than going to a
private doctor, for he had to be at the hospital at a certain hour on a
particular morning.To do this he had to stay away from work.The
medicine they prescribed and which he had to buy did him no good, for
the truth was that it was not medicine that he--like thousands of
others--needed, but proper conditions of life and proper food; things
that had been for years past as much out of his reach as if he had been
dying alone in the middle of a desert.Occasionally Nora contrived--by going without some other necessary--to
buy him a bottle of one of the many much-advertised medicines; but
although some of these things were good she was not able to buy enough
for him to derive any benefit from them.Although he was often seized with a kind of terror of the future--of
being unable to work--he fought against these feelings and tried to
believe that when the weather became warmer he would be all right once
more.When Barrington came in Owen was sitting in a deck-chair by the fire in
the sitting-room.He had been to work that day with Harlow, washing off
the ceilings and stripping the old paper from the walls of two rooms in
Rushton's home, and he looked very haggard and exhausted.'I have never told you before,' said Barrington, after they had been
talking for a while, 'but I suppose you have guessed that I did not
work for Rushton because I needed to do so in order to live.I just
wanted to see things for myself; to see life as it is lived by the
majority.He doesn't approve of my
opinions, but at same time he does not interfere with me for holding
them, and I have a fairly liberal allowance which I spent in my own
way.I'm going to pass Christmas with my own people, but in the spring
I intend to fit out a Socialist Van, and then I shall come back here.We'll have some of the best speakers in the movement; we'll hold
meetings every night; we'll drench the town with literature, and we'll
start a branch of the party.'Owen's eye kindled and his pale face flushed.'I shall be able to do something to advertise the meetings,' he said.For instance, I could paint some posters and placards.''And I can help to give away handbills,' chimed in Frankie, looking up
from the floor, where he was seated working the railway.'I know a lot
of boys who'll come along with me to put 'em under the doors as well.'They were in the sitting-room and the door was shut.Mrs Owen was in
the next room with Ruth.While the two men were talking the front-door
bell was heard to ring and Frankie ran out to see who it was, closing
the door after him.Barrington and Owen continued their conversation,
and from time to time they could hear a low murmur of voices from the
adjoining room.After a little while they heard some one go out by the
front door, and almost immediately afterward Frankie--wild with
excitement, burst into the room, crying out:

'Dad and Mr Barrington!And he began capering
gleefully about the room, evidently transported with joy.inquired Barrington, rather mystified
by this extraordinary conduct.'Mr Easton came with Freddie to see Mrs Easton, and she's gone home
again with them,' replied Freddie, 'and--she's given the baby to us for
a Christmas box!'Barrington was already familiar with the fact of Easton's separation
from his wife, and Owen now told him the Story of their reconciliation.His train left at eight;
it was already nearly half past seven, and he said he had a letter to
write.Nora brought the baby in to show him before he went, and then
she helped Frankie to put on his overcoat, for Barrington had requested
that the boy might be permitted to go a little way with him.There was a stationer's shop at the end of the street.He went in here
and bought a sheet of notepaper and an envelope, and, having borrowed
the pen and ink, wrote a letter which he enclosed in the envelope with
the two other pieces that he took out of his pocketbook.Having
addressed the letter he came out of the shop; Frankie was waiting for
him outside.'I want you to take this straight home and give it to your dad.I
don't want you to stop to play or even to speak to anyone till you get
home.''I won't stop running all the way.''I think I have time to
go back with you as far as your front door,' he said, 'then I shall be
quite sure you haven't lost it.'They accordingly retraced their steps and in a few minutes reached the
entrance to the house.Barrington opened the door and stood for a
moment in the hall watching Frankie ascend the stairs.inquired the boy, pausing and
looking over the banisters.'Because we can see the bridge from our front-room window, and if you
were to wave your handkerchief as your train goes over the bridge, we
could wave back.'Barrington waited till he heard Frankie open and close the door of
Owen's flat, and then he hurried away.When he gained the main road he
heard the sound of singing and saw a crowd at the corner of one of the
side-streets.As he drew near he perceived that it was a religious
meeting.There was a lighted lamp on a standard in the centre of the crowd and
on the glass of this lamp was painted: 'Be not deceived: God is not
mocked.'Mr Rushton was preaching in the centre of the ring.He said that they
had come hout there that evening to tell the Glad Tidings of Great Joy
to hall those dear people that he saw standing around.The members of
the Shining Light Chapel--to which he himself belonged--was the
organizers of that meeting but it was not a sectarian meeting, for he
was 'appy to say that several members of other denominations was there
co-operating with them in the good work.As he continued his address,
Rushton repeatedly referred to the individuals who composed the crowd
as his 'Brothers and Sisters' and, strange to say, nobody laughed.Barrington looked round upon the 'Brothers': Mr Sweater, resplendent in
a new silk hat of the latest fashion, and a fur-trimmed overcoat.Mr Bosher, Vicar of the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, Mr
Grinder--one of the churchwardens at the same place of alleged
worship--both dressed in broadcloth and fine linen and glossy silk
hats, while their general appearance testified to the fact that they
had fared sumptuously for many days.Mr Didlum, Mrs Starvem, Mr
Dauber, Mr Botchit, Mr Smeeriton, and Mr Leavit.John Starr, doing the work for which he
was paid.As he stood there in the forefront of this company, there was nothing
in his refined and comely exterior to indicate that his real function
was to pander to and flatter them; to invest with an air of
respectability and rectitude the abominably selfish lives of the gang
of swindlers, slave-drivers and petty tyrants who formed the majority
of the congregation of the Shining Light Chapel.He was doing the work for which he was paid.By the mere fact of his
presence there, condoning and justifying the crimes of these typical
representatives of that despicable class whose greed and inhumanity
have made the earth into a hell.There was also a number of'respectable', well-dressed people who
looked as if they could do with a good meal, and a couple of shabbily
dressed, poverty-stricken-looking individuals who seemed rather out of
place in the glittering throng.The remainder of the Brothers consisted of half-starved, pale-faced
working men and women, most of them dressed in other people's cast-off
clothing, and with broken, patched-up, leaky boots on their feet.Rushton having concluded his address, Didlum stepped forward to give
out the words of the hymn the former had quoted at the conclusion of
his remarks:


        'Oh, come and jine this 'oly band,
        And hon to glory go.'Strange and incredible as it may appear to the reader, although none of
them ever did any of the things Jesus said, the people who were
conducting this meeting had the effrontery to claim to be followers of
Christ--Christians!Jesus said: 'Lay not up for yourselves treasure upon earth', 'Love not
the world nor the things of the world', 'Woe unto you that are rich--it
is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich
man to enter the kingdom of heaven.'Yet all these self-styled
'Followers' of Christ made the accumulation of money the principal
business of their lives.Jesus said: 'Be ye not called masters; for they bind heavy burdens and
grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders, but they
themselves will not touch them with one of their fingers.For one is
your master, even Christ, and ye are all brethren.'But nearly all
these alleged followers of the humble Workman of Nazareth claimed to be
other people's masters or mistresses.And as for being all brethren,
whilst most of these were arrayed in broadcloth and fine linen and
fared sumptuously every day, they knew that all around them thousands
of those they hypocritically called their 'brethren', men, women and
little children, were slowly perishing of hunger and cold; and we have
already seen how much brotherhood existed between Sweater and Rushton
and the miserable, half-starved wretches in their employment.Whenever they were asked why they did not practise the things Jesus
preached, they replied that it is impossible to do so!They did not
seem to realize that when they said this they were saying, in effect,
that Jesus taught an impracticable religion; and they appeared to
forget that Jesus said, 'Wherefore call ye me Lord, Lord, when ye do
not the things I say?...''Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and
doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house
upon the sand.'But although none of these self-styled 'Followers' of Christ, ever did
the things that Jesus said, they talked a great deal about them, and
sang hymns, and for a pretence made long prayers, and came out here to
exhort those who were still in darkness to forsake their evil ways.And
they procured this lantern and wrote a text upon it: 'Be not deceived,
God is not mocked.'They stigmatized as 'infidels' all those who differed from them,
forgetting that the only real infidels are those who are systematically
false and unfaithful to the Master they pretend to love and serve.Grinder, having a slight cold, had not spoken this evening, but several
other infidels, including Sweater, Didlum, Bosher, and Starr, had
addressed the meeting, making a special appeal to the working people,
of whom the majority of the crowd was composed, to give up all the vain
pleasures of the world in which they at present indulged, and, as
Rushton had eloquently put it at the close of his remarks:

        'Come and jine this 'Oly band and hon to glory go!'As Didlum finished reading out the words, the lady at the harmonium
struck up the tune of the hymns, and the disciples all joined in the
singing:

        'Oh, come and join this 'oly band and hon to glory go.'During the singing certain of the disciples went about amongst the
crowd distributing tracts.Presently one of them offered one to
Barrington and as the latter looked at the man he saw that it was
Slyme, who also recognized him at the same instant and greeted him by
name.Barrington made no reply except to decline the tract:

'I don't want that--from you,' he said contemptuously.'Oh, I know what you're thinking of,' he said after
a pause and speaking in an injured tone; 'but you shouldn't judge
anyone too hard.It wasn't only my fault, and you don't know 'ow much
I've suffered for it.If it 'adn't been for the Lord, I believe I
should 'ave drownded myself.'Barrington made no answer and Slyme slunk off, and when the hymn was
finished Brother Sweater stood forth and gave all those present a
hearty invitation to attend the services to be held during the ensuing
week at the Chapel of the Shining Light.He invited them there
specially, of course, because it was the place with which he was
himself connected, but he entreated and begged of them even if they
would not come there to go Somewhere; there were plenty of other places
of worship in the town; in fact, there was one at the corner of nearly
every street.Those who did not fancy the services at the Shining
Light could go to the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, but he really did
hope that all those dear people whom he saw standing round would go
Somewhere.A short prayer from Bosher closed the meeting, and now the reason for
the presence of the two poverty-stricken-looking shabbily dressed
disciples was made manifest, for while the better dressed and therefore
more respectable Brothers were shaking hands with and grinning at each
other or hovering round the two clergymen and Mr Sweater, these two
poor wretches carried away the harmonium and the lantern, together with
the hymn books and what remained of the tracts.As Barrington hurried
off to catch the train one of the 'Followers' gave him a card which he
read by the light of a street lamp--

                   Come and join the Brotherhood
                    at the Shining Light Chapel
                                PSA
                    Every Sunday at 3 o'clock.'Oh come and join this Holy Band
                        and on to Glory go.'Barrington thought he would, rather go to hell--if there were such a
place--with some decent people, than share 'glory' with a crew like
this.Nora sat sewing by the fireside in the front room, with the baby asleep
in her lap.Owen was reclining in the deck-chair opposite.They had
both been rather silent and thoughtful since Barrington's departure.It was mainly by their efforts that the reconciliation between Easton
and Ruth had been effected and they had been so desirous of
accomplishing that result that they had not given much thought to their
own position.'I feel that I could not bear to part with her for anything now,' said
Nora at last breaking the long silence, 'and Frankie is so fond of her
too.But all the same I can't feel happy about it when I think how ill
you are.''Oh, I shall be all right when the weather gets a little warmer,' said
Owen, affecting a cheerfulness he did not feel.'We have always pulled
through somehow or other; the poor little thing is not going to make
much difference, and she'll be as well off with us as she would have
been if Ruth had not gone back.'As he spoke he leaned over and touched the hand of the sleeping child
and the little fingers closed round one of his with a clutch that sent
a thrill all through him.As he looked at this little helpless,
dependent creature, he realized with a kind of thankfulness that he
would never have the heart to carry out the dreadful project he had
sometimes entertained in hours of despondency.'We've always got through somehow or other,' he repeated, 'and we'll do
so still.'Presently they heard Frankie's footsteps ascending the stairs and a
moment afterwards the boy entered the room.'We have to look out of the window and wave to Mr Barrington when his
train goes over the bridge,' he cried breathlessly.Open the window, quick, Dad, or it may be too late.''There's plenty of time yet,' replied Owen, smiling at the boy's
impetuosity.We don't want the window open
all that time.It's only a quarter to eight by our clock now, and
that's five minutes fast.'However, so as to make quite certain that the train should not run past
unnoticed, Frankie pulled up the blind and, rubbing the steam off the
glass, took up his station at the window to watch for its coming, while
Owen opened the letter:

'Dear Owen,

'Enclosed you will find two bank-notes, one for ten pounds and the
other for five.The first I beg you will accept from me for yourself
in the same spirit that I offer it, and as I would accept it from you
if our positions were reversed.If I were in need, I know that you
would willingly share with me whatever you had and I could not hurt you
by refusing.The other note I want you to change tomorrow morning.Give three pounds of it to Mrs Linden and the remainder to Bert White's
mother.'Wishing you all a happy Xmas and hoping to find you well and eager for
the fray when I come back in the spring,

                             'Yours for the cause,

                                                  'George Barrington.'Owen read it over two or three times before he could properly
understand it and then, without a word of comment--for he could not
have spoken at that moment to save his life--he passed it to Nora, who
felt, as she read it in her turn, as if a great burden had been lifted
from her heart.All the undefined terror of the future faded away as
she thought of all this small piece of paper made possible.Meanwhile, Frankie, at the window, was straining his eyes in the
direction of the station.'Don't you think we'd better have the window open now, Dad?'he said at
last as the clock struck eight.'The steam keeps coming on the glass
as fast as I wipe it off and I can't see out properly.I'm sure it's
nearly time now; p'raps our clock isn't as fast as you think it is.''All right, we'll have it open now, so as to be on the safe side,' said
Owen as he stood up and raised the sash, and Nora, having wrapped the
child up in a shawl, joined them at the window.'It can't be much longer now, you know,' said Frankie.They turned the red light off the signal just before you opened
the window.'In a very few minutes they heard the whistle of the locomotive as it
drew out of the station, then, an instant before the engine itself came
into sight round the bend, the brightly polished rails were
illuminated, shining like burnished gold in the glare of its headlight;
a few seconds afterwards the train emerged into view, gathering speed
as it came along the short stretch of straight way, and a moment later
it thundered across the bridge.It was too far away to recognize his
face, but they saw someone looking out of a carriage window waving a
handkerchief, and they knew it was Barrington as they waved theirs in
return.Soon there remained nothing visible of the train except the
lights at the rear of the guard's van, and presently even those
vanished into the surrounding darkness.The lofty window at which they were standing overlooked several of the
adjacent streets and a great part of the town.On the other side of the
road were several empty houses, bristling with different house agents'
advertisement boards and bills.About twenty yards away, the shop
formerly tenanted by Mr Smallman, the grocer, who had become bankrupt
two or three months previously, was also plastered with similar
decorations.A little further on, at the opposite corner, were the
premises of the Monopole Provision Stores, where brilliant lights were
just being extinguished, for they, like most of the other shops, were
closing their premises for the night, and the streets took on a more
cheerless air as one after another their lights disappeared.It had been a fine day, and during the earlier part of the evening the
moon, nearly at the full, had been shining in a clear and starry sky;
but a strong north-east wind had sprung up within the last hour; the
weather had become bitterly cold and the stars were rapidly being
concealed from view by the dense banks of clouds that were slowly
accumulating overhead.As they remained at the window looking out over this scene for a few
minutes after the train had passed out of sight, it seemed to Owen that
the gathering darkness was as a curtain that concealed from view the
Infamy existing beyond.In every country, myriads of armed men waiting
for their masters to give them the signal to fall upon and rend each
other like wild beasts.All around was a state of dreadful anarchy;
abundant riches, luxury, vice, hypocrisy, poverty, starvation, and
crime.Men literally fighting with each other for the privilege of
working for their bread, and little children crying with hunger and
cold and slowly perishing of want.The gloomy shadows enshrouding the streets, concealing for the time
their grey and mournful air of poverty and hidden suffering, and the
black masses of cloud gathering so menacingly in the tempestuous sky,
seemed typical of the Nemesis which was overtaking the Capitalist
System.That atrocious system which, having attained to the fullest
measure of detestable injustice and cruelty, was now fast crumbling
into ruin, inevitably doomed to be overwhelmed because it was all so
wicked and abominable, inevitably doomed to sink under the blight and
curse of senseless and unprofitable selfishness out of existence for
ever, its memory universally execrated and abhorred.But from these ruins was surely growing the glorious fabric of the
Co-operative Commonwealth.Mankind, awaking from the long night of
bondage and mourning and arising from the dust wherein they had lain
prone so long, were at last looking upward to the light that was riving
asunder and dissolving the dark clouds which had so long concealed from
them the face of heaven.The light that will shine upon the world wide
Fatherland and illumine the gilded domes and glittering pinnacles of
the beautiful cities of the future, where men shall dwell together in
true brotherhood and goodwill and joy.The Golden Light that will be
diffused throughout all the happy world from the rays of the risen sun
of Socialism.Appendix

Mugsborough


Mugsborough was a town of about eighty thousand inhabitants, about two
hundred miles from London.It was built in a verdant valley.Looking
west, north or east from the vicinity of the fountain on the Grand
Parade in the centre of the town, one saw a succession of pine-clad
hills.To the south, as far as the eye could see, stretched a vast,
cultivated plain that extended to the south coast, one hundred miles
away.The climate was supposed to be cool in summer and mild in winter.The town proper nestled in the valley: to the west, the most beautiful
and sheltered part was the suburb of Irene: here were the homes of the
wealthy residents and prosperous tradespeople, and numerous
boarding-houses for the accommodation of well-to-do visitors.East,
the town extended up the <DW72> to the top of the hill and down the
other side to the suburb of Windley, where the majority of the working
classes lived.Years ago, when the facilities for foreign travel were fewer and more
costly, Mugsborough was a favourite resort of the upper classes, but of
late years most of these patriots have adopted the practice of going on
the Continent to spend the money they obtain from the working people of
England.However, Mugsborough still retained some semblance of
prosperity.Summer or winter the place was usually fairly full of what
were called good-class visitors, either holidaymakers or invalids.The
Grand Parade was generally crowded with well-dressed people and
carriages.The shops appeared to be well-patronized and at the time of
our story an air of prosperity pervaded the town.But this fair
outward appearance was deceitful.The town was really a vast whited
sepulchre; for notwithstanding the natural advantages of the place the
majority of the inhabitants existed in a state of perpetual poverty
which in many cases bordered on destitution.One of the reasons for
this was that a great part of the incomes of the tradespeople and
boarding-house-keepers and about a third of the wages of the working
classes were paid away as rent and rates.For years the Corporation had been borrowing money for necessary public
works and improvements, and as the indebtedness of the town increased
the rates rose in proportion, because the only works and services
undertaken by the Council were such as did not yield revenue.Every
public service capable of returning direct profit was in the hands of
private companies, and the shares of the private companies were in the
hands of the members of the Corporation, and the members of the
Corporation were in the hands of the four most able and intellectual of
their number, Councillors Sweater, Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, each of
whom was a director of one or more of the numerous companies which
battened on the town.The Tramway Company, the Water Works Company, the Public Baths Company,
the Winter Gardens Company, the Grand Hotel Company and numerous
others.There was, however, one Company in which Sweater, Rushton,
Didlum and Grinder had no shares, and that was the Gas Company, the
oldest and most flourishing of them all.This institution had grown
with the place; most of the original promoters were dead, and the
greater number of the present shareholders were non-residents; although
they lived on the town, they did not live in it.The profits made by this Company were so great that, being prevented by
law from paying a larger dividend than ten percent, they frequently
found it a difficult matter to decide what to do with the money.They
paid the Directors and principal officials--themselves shareholders, of
course--enormous salaries.They built and furnished costly and
luxurious offices and gave the rest to the shareholders in the form of
Bonuses.There was one way in which the Company might have used some of the
profits: it might have granted shorter hours and higher wages to the
workmen whose health was destroyed and whose lives were shortened by
the terrible labour of the retort-houses and the limesheds; but of
course none of the directors or shareholders ever thought of doing
that.It was not the business of the Company to concern itself about
them.Years ago, when it might have been done for a comparatively small
amount, some hare-brained Socialists suggested that the town should buy
the Gas Works, but the project was wrecked by the inhabitants, upon
whom the mere mention of the word Socialist had the same effect that
the sight of a red rag is popularly supposed to have on a bull.Of course, even now it was still possible to buy out the Company, but
it was supposed that it would cost so much that it was generally
considered to be impracticable.Although they declined to buy the Gas works, the people of Mugsborough
had to buy the gas.The amount paid by the municipality to the Company
for the public lighting of the town loomed large in the accounts of the
Council.It took
years in Great Britain for intelligent railroad managers to learn
that the more protected and comfortable a man is the better he will
attend to his duty.And even when the old argument, refuted by long
experience, was at last abandoned as respected the locomotive cab,
it, with perfect freshness and confidence in its own novelty and
force, promptly showed its brutal visage in opposition to the next
new safeguard.For the reasons which Captain Tyler has so forcibly put in the
extracts which have just been quoted, the argument against the block
system from the increased carelessness of employés, supposed to be
induced by it, is entitled to no weight.Neither is the argument
from the delicacy and complication of the automatic, electric signal
system entitled to any more, when urged against that.Not only has
it been too often refuted under similar conditions by practical
results, but in this case it is based on certain assumptions of
fact which are wholly opposed to experience.The record does not
show that there is any peculiar liability to railroad accidents
during periods of storm; perhaps because those in charge of train
movements or persons crossing tracks are under such circumstances
more especially on the look out for danger.On the contrary the
full average of accidents of the worst description appear to
have occurred under the most ordinary conditions of weather, and
usually in the most unanticipated way.This is peculiarly true of
accidents at highway grade crossings.These commonly occur when the
conditions are such as to cause the highway travelers to suppose
that, if any danger existed, they could not but be aware of it.In the next place, the question in regard to automatic electric
signals is exactly what it was in regard to the Westinghouse brake,
with its air-pump, its valves and connecting tubes;--it is the
purely practical question,--Does the thing work?--The burden of
proof is properly on the inventor.In the case of the electric signals they have for years been
in limited but constant use, and while thus in use they have been
undergoing steady improvement.Though now brought to a considerable
degree of comparative perfection they are, of course, still in
their earlier stage of development.In use, however, they have not
been found open to the practical objections urged against them.At
first much too complicated and expensive, requiring more machinery
than could by any reasonable exertions be kept in order and more
care than they were worth, they have now been simplified until a
single battery properly located can do all the necessary work for
a road of indefinite length.As a system they are effective and do
not lead to accidents; nor are they any more subject than telegraph
wires to derangement from atmospheric causes.When any disturbance
does take place, until it can be overcome it amounts simply to a
general signal for operating the road with extreme caution.But with
railroads, as everywhere else in life, it is the normal condition of
affairs for which provision must be made, while the dangers incident
to exceptional circumstances must be met by exceptional precautions.As long as things are in their normal state, that is, probably,
during nineteen days out of twenty, the electric signals have now
through several years of constant trial proved themselves a reliable
safeguard.It can hardly admit of doubt that in the near future they
will be both further perfected and generally adopted.In their management of switches, especially at points of railroad
convergence where a heavy traffic is concentrated and the passage
of trains or movement of cars and locomotives is unceasing,
the English are immeasurably in advance of the Americans; and,
indeed, of all other people.In fact, in this respect the American
managers have shown themselves slow to learn, and have evinced an
indisposition to adopt labor-saving appliances which, considering
their usual quickness of discernment in that regard, is at first
sight inexplicable.Having always been accustomed to the old and
simple methods, just so long as they can through those methods
handle their traffic with a bearable degree of inconvenience and
expense, they will continue to do so.That their present method is
most extravagant, just as extravagant as it would be to rent two
houses or to run two steam engines where one, if properly used,
could be made to suffice, admits of demonstration;--but the waste is
not on the surface, and the necessity for economy is not imperative.The difference of conditions and the difference in results may be
made very obvious by a comparison.Take, for instance, London and
Boston--the Cannon street station in the one and the Beach street
station in the other.The concentration of traffic at London is so
great that it becomes necessary to utilize every foot of ground
devoted to railroad purposes to the utmost possible extent.Not
only must it be packed with tracks, but those tracks must never be
idle.The incessant train movement at Cannon street has already
been referred to as probably the most extraordinary and confusing
spectacle in the whole wide circle of railroad wonders.The result
is that in some way, at this one station and under this single roof,
more trains must daily be made to enter and leave than enter and
leave, not only the Beach street station, but all the eight railroad
stations in Boston combined.[15]

  [15] "It has been estimated that an average of 50,000 persons were,
  in 1869, daily brought into Boston and carried from it, on three
  hundred and eighty-five trains, while the South Eastern railway of
  London received and despatched in 1870, on an average, six hundred
  and fifty trains a day, between 6 A.M.carrying from
  35,000 to 40,000 persons, and this too without the occurrence of a
  single train accident during the year.On one single exceptional
  day eleven hundred and eleven trains, carrying 145,000 persons, are
  said to have entered and left this station in the space of eighteen
  hours."--_Third Annual Report, [1872] of Massachusetts Railroad
  Commissioners, p.141._

  The passenger movement over the roads terminating in Boston was
  probably as heavy on June 17, 1875, as during any twenty-four hours
  in their history.It was returned at 280,000 persons carried in
  641 trains.About twice the passenger movement of the "exceptional
  day" referred to, carried in something more than half the number of
  trains, entering and leaving eight stations instead of one.During eighteen successive hours trains have been made to enter and
leave this station at the rate of more than one in each minute.It
contains four platforms and seven tracks, the longest of which is
720 feet.As compared with the largest station in Boston (the Boston
& Providence), it has the same number of platforms and an aggregate
of 1,500 (three-fifths) more feet of track under cover; it daily
accommodates about nine times as many trains and four times as many
passengers.Of it Barry, in his treatise on Railway Appliances (p.197), says: "The platform area at this station is probably minimised
but, the station accommodates efficiently a very large mixed traffic
of long and short journey trains, amounting at times to as many as
400 trains in and 400 trains out in a working day.[16]"

  [16] The Grand Central Depot on 42d Street in New York City, has
  nearly twice the amount of track room under cover of the Cannon
  street station.The daily train movement of the latter would be
  precisely paralleled in New York, though not equalled in amount, if
  the 42d street station were at Trinity church, and, in addition to
  the trains which now enter and leave it, all the city trains of the
  Elevated road were also provided for there.The American system is, therefore, one of great waste; for, being
conducted in the way it is--that is with stations and tracks
utilized to but a fractional part of their utmost capacity--it
requires a large number of stations and tracks and the services of
many employés.Indeed it is safe to say that, judged by the London
standard, not more than two of the eight stations in Boston are at
this time utilized to above a quarter part of their full working
capacity; and the same is probably true of all other American
cities.Both employés and the travelling public are accustomed to a
slow movement and abundance of room; land is comparatively cheap,
and the pressure of concentration has only just begun to make itself
felt.Accordingly any person, who cares to pass an hour during the
busy time of day in front of an American city station, cannot but
be struck, while watching the constant movement, with the primitive
way in which it is conducted.Here are a multiplicity of tracks all
connected with each other, and cars and locomotives are being passed
from one to another from morning to night.A constant shifting
of switches is going on, and the little shunting engines never
stand still.The switches, however, as a rule, are unprovided with
signals, except of the crudest description; they have no connection
with each other, and during thirty years no change has been made
in the method in which they are worked.When one of them has to be
shifted, a man goes to it and shifts it.To facilitate the process,
the monitor shunting engines are provided with a foot-board in front
and behind, just above the track, upon which the yard hands jump,
and are carried about from switch to switch, thus saving the time
they would occupy if they had to walk.A simpler arrangement could
not be imagined; anyone could devise it.The only wonder is that
even a considerable traffic can be conducted safely in reliance upon
it.Turning from Beach to Cannon street, it is apparent that the
train movement which has there to be accommodated would fall into
inextricable confusion if it was attempted to manage it in the way
which has been described.The number of trains is so great and
the movement so rapid and intricate, that not even a regiment of
employés stationed here and there at the signals and switches could
keep things in motion.From time to time they would block, and then
the whole vast machine would be brought to a standstill until order
could be re-established.The difficulty is overcome in a very simple
way, by means of an equally simple apparatus.The control over
the numerous switches and corresponding signals, instead of being
divided up among many men stationed at many points, is concentrated
in the hands of two men occupying a single gallery, which is
elevated across the tracks in front of the station and commanding
the approaches to it, much as the pilot-house of an American steamer
commands a view of the course before it.From this gallery, by means
of what is known as the interlocking system, every switch and signal
in the yard below is moved; and to such a point of perfection has
the apparatus been carried, that any disaster from the misplacement
of a switch or the display of a wrong signal is rendered impossible.Of this Cannon street apparatus Barry says, "there are here nearly
seventy point and signal levers concentrated in one signal house;
the number of combinations which would be possible if all the
signal and point levers were not interlocked can be expressed only
by millions.Of these only 808 combinations are safe, and by the
interlocking apparatus these 808 combinations are rendered possible,
and all the others impossible."[17]

  [17] _Railway Appliances_, p.It is not proposed to enter at any length into the mechanical
details of this appliance, which, however, must be considered as one
of the three or four great inventions which have marked epochs in
the history of railroad traffic.[18] As, however, it is but little
known in America, and will inevitably within the next few years find
here the widest field for its increased use, a slight sketch of its
gradual development and of its leading mechanical features may not
be out of place.Prior to the year 1846 the switches and signals
on the English roads were worked in the same way that they are now
commonly worked in this country.As a train drew near to a junction,
for instance, the switchman stationed there made the proper track
connection and then displayed the signal which indicated what tracks
were opened and what closed, and which line had the right of way;
and the engine-drivers acted accordingly.As the number of trains
increased and the movement at the junctions became more complicated,
the danger of the wrong switches being thrown or the wrong signals
displayed, increased also.Mistakes from time to time would happen,
even when only the most careful and experienced men were employed;
and mistakes in these matters led to serious consequences.It,
therefore, became the practice, instead of having the switch or
signal lever at the point where the switch or signal itself was, as
is still almost universally the case in this country, to connect
them by rods or wires with their levers, which were concentrated
at some convenient point for working, and placed under the control
of one man instead of several.So far as it went this change was
an improvement, but no provision yet existed against the danger of
mistake in throwing switches and displaying signals.The blunder of
first making one combination of tracks and then showing the signal
for another was less liable to happen after the concentration of
the levers under one hand than before, but it still might happen at
any time, and certainly would happen at some time.If all danger of
accident from human fallibility was ever to be eliminated a far more
complicated mechanical apparatus must be devised.In response to
this need the system of interlocking was gradually developed, though
not until about the year 1856 was it brought to any considerable
degree of perfection.The whole object of this system is to
render it impossible for a switchman, whether because he is weary
or agitated or actually malicious or only inexperienced, to give
contrary signals, or to break his line in one way and to give the
signal for its being broken in another way.To bring this about the
levers are concentrated in a cabin or gallery, and placed side by
side in a frame, their lower ends connecting with the switch-points
and signals by means of rods and wires.Beneath this frame are one
or more long bars, extending its entire length under it and parallel
with it.These are called locking bars; for, being moved to the
right or left by the action of the levers they hold these levers in
certain designated positions, nor do they permit them to occupy any
other.In this way what is termed the interlocking is effected.The
apparatus, though complicated, is simplicity itself compared with
a clock or a locomotive.The complication, also, such as it is,
arises from the fact that each situation is a problem by itself, and
as such has to be studied out and provided for separately.This,
however, is a difficulty affecting the manufacturer rather than the
operator.To the latter the apparatus presents no difficulty which
a fairly intelligent mechanic cannot easily master; while for the
former the highly complicated nature of the problem may, perhaps,
best be inferred from the example given by Mr.Barry, the simplest
that can offer, that of an ordinary junction where a double-track
branch-road connects with its double-track main line.There would
in this case be of necessity two switch levers and four signal
levers, which would admit of sixty-four possible combinations."The
signal might be arranged in any of sixteen ways, and the points
might occupy any of four positions, irrespective of the position
of the signals.Of the sixty-four combinations thus possible
only thirteen are safe, and the rest are such as might lure an
engine-driver into danger."[18] A sufficiently popular description of this apparatus also,
  illustrated by cuts, will be found in Barry's excellent little
  treatise on _Railway Appliances_, already referred to, published by
  Longmans & Co.as one of their series of text-books of science.Originally the locking bar was worked through the direct action of
certain locks, as they were called, between which the levers when
moved played to and fro.These locks were mere bars or plates of
iron, some with inclined sides, and others with sides indented or
notched.At one end they were secured on a pivot to a fixed bar
opposite to and parallel with the movable locking bar, while their
other ends were made fast to the locking bar; whence it necessarily
followed that, as certain of the levers were pushed to and fro
between them, the action of these levers on the inclined sides of
the locks could by a skilful combination be made to throw other
levers into the notches and indentations of other locks, thus
securing them in certain positions, and making it impossible for
them to be in any other positions.The apparatus which has been described, though a great improvement
on anything which had preceded it, was still but a clumsy affair,
and naturally the friction of the levers on the locks was so great
that they soon became worn, and when worn they could not be relied
upon to move the switch-points with the necessary accuracy.The new
appliance of safety had, therefore, as is often the case, introduced
a new and very considerable danger of its own.The signals and
switches, it was true, could no longer disagree, but the points
themselves were sometimes not properly set, or, owing to the great
exertion required to work it, the interlocking gear was strained.This difficulty resulted in the next and last improvement, which
was a genuine triumph of mechanical ingenuity.To insure the proper
length of stroke being made in moving the lever--that is to make
it certain in each case that the switch points were brought into
exactly the proper position--two notches were provided in the slot,
or quadrant, as it is called, in which the lever moved, and, when
it was thrown squarely home, and not until then, a spring catch
caught in one or other of these notches.This spring was worked by
a clasp at the handle of the lever, and the whole was called the
spring catch-rod.By a singularly ingenious contrivance, the process
of interlocking was transferred from the action of the levers and
the keys to these spring catch-rods, which were made to work upon
each other, and thus to become the medium through which the whole
process is effected.The result of this improvement was that, as
the switchman cannot move any lever until the spring-catch rod is
fastened, except for a particular movement, he cannot, do what he
will, even begin any other movement than that one, as the levers
cannot be started.On the other hand, it may be said that, by means
of this improvement, the mere "intention of the signal-man to move
any lever, expressed by his grasping the lever and so raising the
spring catch-rod, independently of his putting his intention in
force, actuates all the necessary locking.[19]"

  [19] In regard to the interlocking system as then in use in England,
  Captain Tyler in his report as head of the railway inspecting
  department of the Board of Trade, used the following language in
  his report on the accidents during 1870."When the apparatus is
  properly constructed and efficiently maintained, the signalman
  cannot make a mistake in the working of his points and signals which
  shall lead to accident or collision, except only by first lowering
  his signal and switching his train forward, then putting up his
  signal again as it approaches, and altering the points as the driver
  comes up to, or while he is passing over them.Such a mistake was
  actually made in one of the cases above quoted.It is, of course,
  impossible to provide completely for cases of this description; but
  the locking apparatus, as now applied, is already of enormous value
  in preventing accidents; and it will have a still greater effect
  on the general safety of railway travelling as it becomes more
  extensively applied on the older lines.Without it, a signalman in
  constantly working points and signals is almost certain sooner or
  later to make a mistake, and to cause an accident of a more or less
  serious character; and it is inexcusable in any railway company to
  allow its mail or express trains to run at high speed through facing
  points which are not interlocked efficiently with the signals, by
  which alone the engine-drivers in approaching them can be guided.There is however, very much yet to be effected in different parts of
  the country in this respect.And it is worth while to record here,
  in illustration of the difficulties that are sometimes met with by
  the inspecting officers, that the Midland Railway Company formally
  protested in June, 1866, against being compelled to apply such
  apparatus before receiving sanction for the opening of new lines
  of railway.They stated that in complying with the requirements in
  this respect of the Board of Trade, they '_were acting in direct
  opposition to their own convictions, and they must, so far as lay in
  their power, decline the responsibility of the locking system_.'"To still further perfect the appliance a simple mechanism has
  since 1870 been attached to the rod actuating the switch-bolt,
  which prevents the signal-man from shifting the switch under a
  passing train in the manner suggested by Captain Tyler in the above
  extract.In fact it is no exaggeration to say that the interlocking
  system has now been so studied, and every possible contingency so
  thoroughly provided for, that in using it accidents can only occur
  through a wilful intention to bring them about.In spite of any theoretical or fanciful objections which may be
urged against it, this appliance will be found an indispensable
adjunct to any really heavy junction or terminal train movement.For
the elevated railroads of New York, for instance, its early adoption
proved a necessity.As for questions of temperature, climate,
etc., as affecting the long connecting rods and wires which are an
essential part of the system, objections based upon them are purely
imaginary.Difficulties from this source were long since met and
overcome by very simple compensating arrangements, and in practice
occasion no inconvenience.That rods may break, and that wires are
at all times liable to get out of gear, every one knows; and yet
this fact is urged as a novel objection to each new mechanical
improvement.That a broken or disordered apparatus will always
occasion a serious disturbance to any heavy train movement, may also
be admitted.The fact none the less remains that in practice, and
daily subjected through long periods of time to incomparably the
heaviest train movement known to railroad experience, the rods of
the interlocking apparatus do not break, nor do its wires get out
of gear; while by means of it, and of it alone, this train movement
goes unceasingly on never knowing any serious disturbance.[20]

  [20] "As an instance of the possibility of preventing the mistakes
  so often made by signal men with conflicting signals or with facing
  points I have shown the traffic for a single day, and at certain
  hours of that day, at the Cannon Street station of the South Eastern
  Railway, already referred to as one of the _no-accident_ lines of
  the year.The traffic of that station, with trains continually
  crossing one another, by daylight and in darkness, in fog or in
  sunshine, amounts to more than 130 trains in three hours in the
  morning, and a similar number in the evening; and, altogether, to
  652 trains, conveying more than 35,000 passengers in the day as
  a winter, or 40,000 passengers a day as a summer average.It is
  probably not too much to say, that without the signal and point
  arrangements which have there been supplied, and the system of
  interlocking which has there been so carefully carried out, the
  signalmen could not carry on their duties _for one hour without
  accident_."_Captain Tyler's report on accidents for 1870, p.35._

It is not, however, alone in connection with terminal stations and
junctions that the interlocking apparatus is of value.It is also
the scientific substitute for the law or regulation compelling
trains to stop as a measure of precaution when they approach
grade-crossings or draw-bridges.It is difficult indeed to pass from
the consideration of this fine result of science and to speak with
patience of the existing American substitute for it.If the former
is a feature in the block system, the latter is a signal example of
the block-head system.As a device to avoid danger it is a standing
disgrace to American ingenuity; and, fortunately, as stopping is
compatible only with a very light traffic, so soon as the passage
of trains becomes incessant a substitute for it has got to be
devised.In this country, as in England, that substitute will be
found in the interlocking apparatus.By means of it the draw-bridge,
for instance, can be so connected with the danger signals--which
may, if desired, be gates closing across the railroad tracks--that
the one cannot be opened except by closing the other.This is the
method adopted in Great Britain not only at draws in bridges, but
frequently also in the case of gates at level road crossings.It
has already been noticed that in Great Britain accidents at draws
in bridges seem to be unknown.Certainly not one has been reported
during the last nine years.The security afforded in this case
by interlocking would, indeed, seem to be absolute; as, if the
apparatus is out of order, either the gates or the bridge would be
closed, and could not be opened until it was repaired.So also as
respects the grade-crossing of one railroad by another.Bringing
all trains to a complete stop when approaching these crossings
is a precaution quite generally observed in America, either as a
matter of statute law or running regulation; and yet during the six
years 1873-8 no less than 104 collisions were reported at these
crossings.In Great Britain during the nine years 1870-8 but nine
cases of accidents of this description were reported, and in both
the years 1877 and 1878 under the head of "Accidents or Collisions
on Level Crossings of Railways," the chief inspector of the Board
of Trade tersely stated that,--"No accident was inquired into under
this head.[21]" The interlocking system there affords the most
perfect protection which can be devised against a most dangerous
practice in railroad construction to which Americans are almost
recklessly addicted.It is, also, matter of daily experience that
the interlocking system does afford a perfect practical safeguard
in this case.Every junction of a branch with a double track
road involves a grade-crossing, and a grade-crossing of the most
dangerous character.On the Metropolitan Elevated railroad of New
York, at 53d street, there is one of these junctions, where, all
day long, trains are crossing at grade at the rate of some twenty
miles an hour.These trains never stop, except when signalled so
to do.The interlocking apparatus, however, makes it impossible
that one track should be open except when the other is closed.An
accident, therefore, can happen only through the wilful carelessness
of the engineer in charge of a train;--and in the face of wilful
carelessness laws are of no more avail than signals.If a man in
control of a locomotive wishes to bring on a collision he can always
do it.Unless he wishes to, however, the interlocking apparatus
not only can prevent him from so doing, but as a matter of fact
always does.The same rule which holds good at junctions would hold
good at level crossings.There is no essential difference between
the two.By means of the interlocking apparatus the crossing can
be so blocked at any desired distance from it in such a way that
when one track is open the other must be closed;--unless, indeed,
the apparatus is out of order, and then both would be closed.The precaution in this case, also, is absolute.Unlike the rule
as to stopping, it does not depend on the caution or judgment of
individuals;--there are the signals and the obstructions, and
if they are not displayed on one road they are on the other.So
superior is this apparatus in every respect--as regards safety as
well as convenience--to the precaution of coming to a stop, that, as
an inducement to introduce an almost perfect scientific appliance,
it would be very desirable that states like Massachusetts and
Connecticut compelling the stop, should except from the operation
of the law all draw-bridges or grade-crossings at which suitable
interlocking apparatus is provided.Surely it is not unreasonable
that in this case science should have a chance to assert itself.[21] "As affecting the safe working of railways, the level crossing
  of one railway by another is a matter of very serious import.Even when signalled on the most approved principles, they are a
  source of danger, and, if possible, should always be avoided.At
  junctions of branch or other railways the practice has been adopted
  by some companies in special cases, to carry the off line under or
  over the main line by a bridge.This course should generally be
  adopted in the case of railways on which the traffic is large, and
  more expressly where express and fast trains are run."_Report on
  Accidents on Railways of the United Kingdom during 1877, p.35._

In any event, however, the general introduction of the interlocking
apparatus into the American railroad system may be regarded as a
mere question of the value of land and concentration of traffic.So long as every road terminating in our larger cities indulges,
at whatever unnecessary cost to its stockholders, in independent
station buildings far removed from business centres, the train
movement can most economically be conducted as it now is.The
expense of the interlocking apparatus is avoided by the very simple
process of incurring the many fold heavier expense of several
station buildings and vast disconnected station grounds.If,
however, in the city of Boston, for instance, the time should come
when the financial and engineering audacity of the great English
companies shall be imitated,--when some leading railroad company
shall fix its central passenger station on Tremont street opposite
the head of Court street, just as in London the South Eastern
established itself on Cannon street, and then this company carrying
its road from Pemberton Square by a tunnel under Beacon Hill and the
State-house should at the crossing of the Charles radiate out so as
to afford all other roads an access for their trains to the same
terminal point, thus concentrating there the whole daily movement of
that busy population which makes of Boston its daily counting-room
and market-place,--then, when this is attempted, the time will have
come for utilizing to its utmost capacity every available inch of
space to render possible the incessant passage of trains.Then also
will it at last be realized that it is far cheaper to use a costly
and intricate apparatus which enables two companies to be run into
one convenient station, than it is to build a separate station, even
at an inconvenient point, to accommodate each company.In March, 1825, there appeared in the pages of the _Quarterly
Review_ an article in which the writer discussed that railway
system, the first vague anticipation of which was then just
beginning to make the world restless.He did this, too, in a very
intelligent and progressive spirit, but unfortunately secured for
his article a permanence of interest he little expected by the
use of one striking illustration.He was peculiarly anxious to
draw a distinct line of demarcation between his own very rational
anticipations and the visionary dreams of those enthusiasts who
were boring the world to death over the impossibilities which they
claimed that the new invention was to work.Among these he referred
to the proposition that passengers would be "whirled at the rate
of eighteen or twenty miles an hour by means of a high pressure
engine," and then contemptuously added,--"We should as soon expect
the people of Woolwich to suffer themselves to be fired off upon one
of Congreve's _ricochet_ rockets, as trust themselves to the mercy
of such a machine, going at such a rate; their property perhaps they
may trust."Under the circumstances, the criticism was a perfectly reasonable
one.The danger involved in going at such a rate of speed and the
impossibility of stopping in time to avoid a sudden danger, would
naturally suggest themselves to any one as insuperable objections
to the new system for any practical use.Some means of preserving
a sudden and powerful control over a movement of such unheard of
rapidity would almost as a matter of course be looked upon as a
condition precedent.Yet it is a most noticeable fact in the history
of railroad development that the improvement in appliances for
controlling speed by no means kept pace with the increased rate of
speed attained.Indeed, so far as the possibility of rapid motion
is concerned, there is no reason to suppose that the _Rocket_
could not have held its own very respectably by the side of a
passenger locomotive of the present day.It will be remembered
that on the occasion of the Manchester & Liverpool opening, Mr.Huskisson after receiving his fatal injury was carried seventeen
miles in twenty-five minutes.Since then the details of locomotive
construction have been simplified and improved upon, but no great
change has been or probably will be effected in the matter of
velocity;--as respects that the maximum was practically reached
at once.Yet down to the year 1870 the brake system remained very
much what it was in 1830.Improvements in detail were effected,
but the essential principles were the same.In case of any sudden
emergency, the men in charge of the locomotive had no direct control
over the vehicles in the train; they communicated with them by the
whistle, and when the signal was heard the brakes were applied as
soon as might be.When a train is moving at the rate of forty miles
an hour, by no means a great speed for it while in full motion, it
passes over fifty-eight feet each second;--at sixty miles an hour it
passes over eighty-eight feet.Under these circumstances, supposing
an engine driver to become suddenly aware of an obstruction on the
track, as was the case at Revere, or of something wrong in the train
behind him, as at Shipton, he had first himself to signal danger,
and to this signal the brakemen throughout the train had to respond.Each operation required time, and every second of time represented
many feet of space.It was small matter for surprise, therefore,
that when in 1875 they experimented scientifically in England, it
was ascertained that a train of a locomotive and thirteen cars
moving at a speed of forty-five miles an hour could not be brought
to a stand in less than one minute, or before it had traversed a
distance of half a mile.The same result it will be remembered was
arrived at by practical experience in America, where both at Angola
and at Port Jervis,[22] it was found impossible to stop the trains
in less than half-a-mile, though in each case two derailed cars were
dragging and plunging along at the end of them.[22] _Ante_, pp.The need of a continuous train-brake, operated from the locomotive
and under the immediate control of the engine-driver, had been
emphasized through years by the almost regular recurrence of
accidents of the most appalling character.In answer to this need
almost innumerable appliances had been patented and experimented
with both in Europe and in America.Prior to 1869, however,
these had been almost exclusively what are known as emergency
brakes;--that is, although the trains were equipped with them and
they were operated from the locomotives, they were not relied upon
for ordinary use, but were held in reserve, as it were, against
special exigencies.The Hudson River railroad train at the Hamburg
accident was thus equipped.Practically, appliances which in the
operation of railroads are reserved for emergencies are usually
found of little value when the emergency occurs.Accordingly no
continuous brake had, prior to the development of Westinghouse's
invention, worked its way into general use.Patent brakes had
become a proverb as well as a terror among railroad mechanics,
and they had ceased to believe that any really desirable thing of
the sort would ever be perfected.Westinghouse, therefore, had a
most unbelieving audience to encounter, and his invention had to
fight hard for all the favor it won; nor did his experience with
master mechanics differ, probably, much from Miller's.His first
patents were taken out in 1869, and he early secured the powerful
aid of the Pennsylvania road for his invention.The Pullman Car
Company, also, always anxious to avail themselves of every appliance
of safety as well as of comfort, speedily saw the merits of the
new brake and adopted it; but, as they merely furnished cars and
had nothing to do with the locomotives that pulled them, their
support was not so effective as that of the great railroad company.Naturally enough, also, great hesitation was felt in adopting so
complicated an appliance.It added yet another whole apparatus to
a thing which was already overburdened with machinery.There was,
also, something in the delicacy and precision of the parts of this
new contrivance,--in its air-pump and reservoirs and long connecting
tubes with their numerous valves,--which was peculiarly distasteful
to the average practical railroad mechanic.It was true that the
idea of transmitting power by means of compressed air was by no
means new,--that thousands of drills were being daily driven by
it wherever tunnelling was going on or miners were at work,--yet
the application of this familiar power to the wheels of a railroad
train seemed no less novel than it was bold.It was, in the first
place, evident that the new apparatus would not stand the banging
and hammering to which the old-fashioned hand-brake might safely
be subjected; not indeed without deranging that simple appliance,
but without incurring any very heavy bill for repairs in so doing.Accordingly the new brake was at first carelessly examined and
patronizingly pushed aside as a pretty toy,--nice in theory no
doubt, but wholly unfitted for rough, every-day use.As it was
tersely expressed during a discussion before the Society of Arts
in London, as recently as May, 1877,--"It was no use bringing out
a brake which could not be managed by ordinary officials,--which
was so wonderfully clever that those who had to use it could not
understand it."A line of argument by the way, which, as has been
already pointed out, may with far greater force be applied to the
locomotive itself; and, indeed, unquestionably was so applied
about half a century ago by men of the same calibre who apply it
now, to the intense weariness and discouragement no doubt of the
late George Stephenson.Whether sound or otherwise, however, few
more effective arguments against an appliance can be advanced; and
against the Westinghouse brake it was advanced so effectively,
that even as late as 1871, although largely in use on western
roads, it had found its way into Massachusetts only as an ingenious
device of doubtful merit.It was in August, 1871, that the Revere
disaster occurred, and the Revere disaster, as has been seen,
would unquestionably have been averted had the colliding train
been provided with proper brake power.This at last called serious
attention there to the new appliance.Even then, however, the mere
suggestion of something better being in existence than the venerable
hand-brakes in familiar use did not pass without a vigorous protest;
and at the meeting of railroad officials, which has already been
referred to as having been called by the state commissioners
after the accident, one prominent gentleman, when asked if the
road under his charge was equipped with the most approved brake,
indignantly replied that it was,--that it was equipped with the
good, old-fashioned hand-brake;--and he then proceeded to vehemently
stake his professional reputation on the absolute superiority of
that ancient but somewhat crude appliance over anything else of the
sort in existence.Nevertheless, on this occasion also, the great
dynamic force which is ever latent in first-class railroad accidents
again asserted itself.Even the most opinionated of professional
railroad men, emphatically as he might in public deny it, quietly
yielded as soon as might be.In a surprisingly short time after the
exhibition of ignorance which has been referred to, the railroads in
Massachusetts, as it has already been shown, were all equipped with
train-brakes.[23]

  [23] Page 157.In its present improved shape it is safe to say that in all those
requisites which the highest authorities known on the subject have
laid down as essential to a model train brake, the Westinghouse
stands easily first among the many inventions of the kind.It is
now a much more perfect appliance than it was in 1871, for it was
then simply atmospheric and continuous in its action, whereas it
has since been made automatic and self-regulating.So far as its
fundamental principle is concerned, that is too generally understood
to call for explanation.By means of an air-pump, attached to the
boiler of the locomotive and controlled by the engine-driver, an
atmospheric force is brought to bear, through tubes running under
the cars, upon the break blocks, pressing them against the wheels.The hand of the engine-driver is in fact on every wheel in the
train.This application of power, though unquestionably ingenious
and, like all good things, most simple and obvious when once
pointed out, was originally open to one great objection, which was
persistently and with great force urged against it.The parts of the
apparatus were all delicate, and some injury or derangement of them
was always possible, and sometimes inevitable.The chief advantage
claimed for the brake was, however, that complete dependence could
be placed upon it in the regular movement of trains.It was obvious,
therefore, that if such dependence was placed upon it and any
derangement did occur, the first intimation those in charge of the
train would have that something was wrong might well come in the
shape of a failure of the brake to act, and a subsequent disaster.Both in Massachusetts and in Connecticut, at the crossing of one
railroad by another at the same level in the former state and in the
approach to draws in bridges in the latter, a number of cases of
this failure of the original Westinghouse non-automatic brake to act
did in point of fact occur.Fortunately they, none of them, resulted
in disaster.This, however, was mere good luck, as was illustrated
in the case of the accident of November 11, 1876, at the Communipaw
Ferry on the New Jersey Central.The train was there equipped with
the ordinary train brake.It reached Jersey City on time shortly
after 4 P.M., but, instead of slacking up, it ran directly through
the station and freight offices, carrying away the walls and
supports, and the locomotive then plunged into the river beyond.The baggage and smoking car followed but fortunately lodged on the
locomotive, thus blocking the remainder of the train.Fortunately no
one was killed, and no passengers were seriously injured.Again, on the Metropolitan Elevated railroad in New York city, on
the evening of June 23, 1879, one of the trains was delayed for a
few moments at the Franklin street station.Meanwhile the next train
came along, and, though the engine-driver of this following train
saw the danger signals and endeavored to stop in time, he found his
brake out of order, and a collision ensued resulting in the injury
of one employé and the severe shattering of a passenger coach and
locomotive.It was only a piece of good fortune that the first
of these accidents did not result in a repetition of the Norwalk
disaster and the second in that of Revere.It so chanced that it was the Smith vacuum brake which failed to
work at Communipaw, and the Eames vacuum which failed to work at
Franklin street.It might just
as well have been the original Westinghouse.The difficulty lay, not
in the maker's name, but in the imperfect action of the brake; and
such significant intimations are not to be disregarded.The chances
are naturally large that the failure of the continuous brake to act
will not at once occur under just those circumstances which will
entail a serious disaster and heavy loss of life; that, however, if
such intimations as these are disregarded, it will sooner or later
so occur does not admit of doubt.But the possibility that upon some given occasion it might fail to
work was not the only defect in the original Westinghouse; it might
well be in perfect order and in full action even, and then suddenly,
as the result of derailment or separation of parts, the apparatus
might be broken, and at once the shoes would drop from the wheels,
and the vehicles of the disabled train would either press forward,
or, on an incline, stop and run backwards until their unchecked
momentum was exhausted.This appears to have been the case at
Wollaston, and contributed some of its most disastrous features to
that accident.To obviate these defects Westinghouse in 1872 invented what he
termed a triple valve attachment, by means of which, if the
thing can be so expressed, his brake was made to always stand at
danger.That is, in case of any derangement of its parts, it was
automatically applied and the train stopped.The action of the brake
was thus made to give notice of anything wrong anywhere in the
train.A noticeable case of this occurred on the Midland railway in
England, when on the November 22, 1876, as the Scotch express was
approaching the Heeley station, at a speed of some sixty miles an
hour, the hind-guard felt the automatic brake suddenly self-applied.The forward truck of a Pullman car in the middle of the train had
left the rails; the front part of the train broke the couplings
and went on, while the rear carriages, acted upon by the automatic
brakes, came to a stand immediately behind the Pullman, which
finally rested on its side across the opposite track.On the other hand, as the Scotch express on the
North Eastern road was approaching Morpeth, on March 25, 1877, at
a speed of some twenty-five miles an hour, the locomotive for some
reason left the track.The train was not equipped with an automatic
brake, and the carriages in it accordingly pressed forward upon
each other until three of them were so utterly destroyed as to be
indistinguishable.Five passengers lost their lives; the remains of
one of whom, together with the wheels of a carriage, were afterwards
taken out from the tank of the tender, into which they had been
driven by the force of the shock.The theoretical objection to the automatic brake is obvious.In
case of any derangement of its machinery it applies itself, and,
should these derangements be of frequent occurrence, the consequent
stoppage of trains would prove a great annoyance, if not a source
of serious danger.This objection is not sustained by practical
experience.The triple valve, so called, is the only complicated
portion of the automatic brake, and this valve is well protected
and not liable to get out of order.[24] Should it become deranged
it will stop the working of the brake on that car alone to which it
belongs; and it will become deranged so as to set the brake only
from causes which would render the non-automatic brake inoperative.When anything of this sort occurs, it stops the train until the
defect is remedied.The returns made to the English Board of
Trade enable us to know just how frequently in actual and regular
service these stoppages occur, and what they amount to.Take, for
instance, the North Eastern and the Caledonian railways.During the last six months of 1878 the first
ran 138,000 train miles with it, in the course of which there
were eight delays or stoppages of some three to five minutes each
occasioned by the action of the triple-valve; being in round numbers
one occasion of delay in 17,000 miles of train movement.On the
Caledonian railway, during the same period, four brake failures, due
to the action of the triple-valve, were reported in runs aggregating
over 62,000 miles, being about one failure to 15,000 miles.These
failures moreover occasioned delays of only a few minutes each, and,
where the cause of the difficulty was not so immediately apparent
that it could at once be remedied, the brake-tubes of the vehicle
on which the difficulty occurred were disconnected, and the trains
went on.[25] One of these stoppages, however, resulted in a serious
accident.As a train on the Caledonian road was approaching the
Wemyss Bay junction on December 14th, in a dense fog, the engine
driver, seeing the signals at danger, undertook to apply his brake
slightly, when it went full on, stopping the train between the
distant and home signals, as they are called in the English block
system.After the danger signal was lowered, but before the brake
could be released, the signal-man allowed a following train to enter
upon the same block section, and a collision followed in which some
thirteen passengers were slightly injured.This accident, however,
as the inspecting officer of the Board of Trade very properly found,
was due not at all to the automatic brake, but to "carelessness
on the part of the signal-man, who disregarded the rules for the
working of the block telegraph instruments," and to the driver
of the colliding train, who "disobeyed the company's running
regulations."It gives an American, however, a realizing sense of
one of the difficulties under which those crowded British lines are
operated, to read that in this case the fog was "so thick that the
tail-lamp was not visible from an approaching train for more than a
few yards."[24] Speaking of the modifications introduced into his brake by
  Westinghouse since 1874, Mr.Thomas E. Harrison, civil engineer
  of the North Eastern Railway Company in a communication to the
  directors of that company of April 24, 1879, recommending the
  adoption by it of the Westinghouse, and subsequently ordered to
  be printed for the use of Parliament, thus referred to the triple
  valve: "As the most important [of these modifications] I will
  particularly draw your attention to the "triple-valve" which has
  been made a regular bugbear by the opponents of the system, and has
  been called complicated, delicate, and liable to get out of order,
  etc.* * * It is, in fact, as simple a piece of mechanism as well
  can be imagined, certain in its action, of durable materials, easily
  accessible to an ordinary workman for examination or cleaning, and
  there is nothing about it that can justify the term complication; on
  the contrary, it is a model of ingenuity and simplicity."[25] During the six months ending June 30, 1879, some 300 stops due
  to some derangement of the apparatus of the Westinghouse brake were
  reported by ten companies in runs aggregating about two million
  miles.Being one stop to 6,600 miles run.Very many of these stops
  were obviously due to the want of familiarity of the employés with
  an apparatus new to them, but as a rule the delays occasioned did
  not exceed a very few minutes; of 82 stoppages, for instance,
  reported on the London, Brighton & South Coast road, the two longest
  were ten minutes each and the remainder averaged some three or four
  minutes.After the application of the triple valve had made it automatic,
there remained but one further improvement necessary to render
the Westinghouse a well-nigh perfect brake.A superabundance of
self-acting power had been secured, but no provision was yet made
for graduating the use of that power so that it should be applied
in the exact degree, neither more nor less, which would soonest
stop the train.This for two reasons is mechanically a matter of
no little importance.As is well known a too severe application of
brakes, no matter of what kind they are, causes the wheels to stand
still and slide upon the rails.This is not only very injurious to
rolling stock, the wheels of which are flattened at the points which
slide, but, as has long been practically well-known to those whose
business it is to run locomotives, when once the wheels begin to
slide the retarding power of the brakes is seriously diminished.In order, therefore, to secure the maximum of retarding power, the
pressure of the brake-blocks on the revolving wheels should be very
great when first applied, and just sufficient not to slide them; and
should then be diminished, _pari passu_ with the momentum of the
train, until it wholly stops.Familiar as all this has long been
to engine-drivers and practical railroad mechanics, yet it has not
been conceded in the results of many scientific inquiries.In the
report of one of the Royal Commissions on Accidents, for instance,
it was asserted that the momentum of a train was retarded more by
the action of sliding than of slowly revolving wheels; and again,
as recently as in May, 1877, in a scientific discussion in London
at one of the meetings of the Society of Arts, a gentleman, with
the letters C. E. appended to his name, ventured the surprising
assertion that "no brake could do more than skid the wheels of
a train, and all continuous brakes professed to do this, and he
believed did so about equally well."Now, what it is here asserted
no brake can do is exactly what the perfect brake will be made to
do,--and what Westinghouse's latest improvement, it is claimed,
enables his brake to do.It much more than "skids the wheels," by
measuring out exactly that degree of power necessary to hold the
wheels just short of the skidding point, and in this way always
exerts the maximum retarding force.This is brought about by means
of a contrivance which allows the air to leak out of the brake
cylinders so as to exactly proportion the pressure of the blocks
on the wheels to the speed with which the latter are revolving.In other, and more scientific, language the force with which the
brake-blocks are pressed upon the wheels is made to adjust itself
automatically as the "coefficient of dynamic friction augments with
the reduction of train speed."It hardly needs to be said that in
this way the power of the brake is enormously increased.In America the superiority of the Westinghouse over any other
description of train-brake has long been established through that
large preponderance of use which in such matters constitutes the
final and irreversible verdict.[26] In Europe, however, and
especially in Great Britain, ever since the Shipton-on-Cherwell
accident in 1874, the battle of the brakes, as it may not
inappropriately be called, has waxed hotter and hotter; and not only
has this battle been extremely interesting in a scientific way, but
it has been highly characteristic, and at times enlivened by touches
of human nature which were exceedingly amusing.[26] In Massachusetts, for instance, where no official pressure
  in favor of any particular brake was brought to bear, out of 473
  locomotives equipped with train-brakes 361 have the Westinghouse,
  which is also applied to 1,363 out of 1,669 cars.Of these, however,
  79 locomotives and 358 cars are equipped with both the atmospheric
  and the vacuum brakes.The English battle of the brakes may be said to have fairly opened
with the official report from Captain Tyler on the Shipton accident,
in reference to which he expressed the opinion, which has already
been quoted in describing the accident, that "if the train had
been fitted with continuous brakes throughout its whole length
there is no reason why it should not have been brought to rest
without any casuality."The Royal Commission on railroad accidents
then took the matter up and called for a series of scientifically
conducted experiments.These took place under the supervision of
two engineers appointed by the Commission, who were aided by a
detail of officers and men from the royal engineers.Eight brakes
competed, and a train, consisting of a locomotive and thirteen
cars, was specially prepared for each.With these trains some
seventy runs were made, and their results recorded and tabulated;
the experiments were continued through six consecutive working
days.Of the brakes experimented with three were American in their
origin,--Westinghouse's automatic and vacuum, and Smith's vacuum.The remainder were English, and were steam, hydraulic, and air
brakes; among them also was one simple emergency brake.The result
of the trials was a very decided victory for the Westinghouse
automatic, and upon its performances the Commission based its
conclusion that trains ought to be so equipped that in cases of
emergency they could be brought to rest, when travelling on level
ground at 50 miles an hour, within a distance of 275 yards; with
an allowance of distance in cases of speed greater or less than
50 miles nearly proportioned to its square.These allowances they
tabulated as follows:--

  At 60 miles per hour, stopping distance within 400 yards.
  "55        "            "           "        340   "
  "  50        "            "           "        275   "
  "  45        "            "           "        220   "
  "  40        "            "           "        180   "
  "  35        "            "           "        135   "
  "  30        "            "           "        100   "

To appreciate the enormous advance in what may be called stopping
power which these experiments revealed, it should be added that
the first series of experiments made at Newark were with trains
equipped only with the hand-brake.The average speed in these
experiments was 47 miles, and with the train-brake, according to the
foregoing tabulation, the stop should have been made in about 250
yards; in reality it was made in a little less than five times that
distance, or 1120 yards; in other words the experiments showed that
the improved appliances had more than quadrupled the control over
trains.It has already been noticed that in the cases of the Angola
and the Port Jervis disasters, as well as in that at Shipton, the
trains ran some 2,700 feet before they could be stopped.Under the
English tabulations above given, in the results of which certain
recent improvements do not enter, a train running into the 42d
Street Station in New York, at a speed of forty-five miles an hour
when under the entrance arches, would be stopped before it reached
the buffers at the end of the covered tracks.The Royal Commission experiments were followed in May and June,
1877, by yet others set on foot by the North Eastern Railway
Company for the purpose of making a competitive test of the
Westinghouse automatic and the Smith's vacuum brakes.At this trial
also the average stop at a speed of 50 miles an hour was effected
in 15 seconds, and within a distance of 650 feet.Other series
of experiments with similar results were, about the same time,
conducted under the auspices of the Belgian and German governments,
of which elaborate official reports were made.The result was that
at last, under date of August 30, 1877, the Board of Trade issued
a circular to the railway companies in which it called attention to
the fact that, notwithstanding all the discussion which had taken
place and the elaborate official trials which the government had set
on foot, there had "apparently been no attempt on the part of the
various companies to take the first step of agreeing upon what are
the requirements which, in their opinion, are essential to a good
continuous brake."In other words, the Board found that, instead of
becoming better, matters were rapidly becoming worse.Each company
was equipping its rolling stock with that appliance in which its
officers happened to be interested as owners or inventors, and when
carriages thus equipped passed from the tracks of one road onto
those of another the result was a return to the old hand-brake
system in a condition of impaired efficiency.The Board accordingly
now proceeded to narrow down the field of selection by specifying
the following as what it considered the essentials of a good
continuous brake:--

     _a._ "The brakes to be efficient in stopping trains,
     instantaneous in their actions, and capable of being applied
     without difficulty by engine-drivers or guards._b._ "In case of accident, to be instantaneously self-acting._c._ "The brakes to be put on and taken off (with facility) on
     the engine and on every vehicle of a train._d._ "The brakes to be regularly used in daily working._e._ "The materials employed to be of a durable character, so as
     to be easily maintained and kept in order."These requirements pointed about as directly as they could to the
Westinghouse, to the exclusion of all competing brakes.Not more
than one other complied with them in all respects, and many made
no pretence of complying at all.Then followed what may be termed
the battle royal of the brakes, which as yet shows no signs of
drawing to a close.As the avowed object of the Board of Trade was
to introduce, one brake, to the necessary exclusion of all others,
throughout the railroad system of Great Britain, the magnitude of
the prize was not easy to over-estimate.The weight of scientific
and official authority was decidedly in favor of the Westinghouse
automatic, but among the railroad men the Smith vacuum found
the largest number of adherents.It failed to meet three of the
requirements of the Board of Trade, in that it was neither automatic
nor instantaneous in its action, while the materials employed in
it were not of a durable character.It was, on the other hand, a
brake of unquestioned excellence, while it commended itself to the
judgment of the average railroad official by its simplicity, and to
that of the average railroad director by its apparent cheapness.Any
one could understand it, and its first cost was temptingly small.The real struggle in Great Britain, therefore, has been, and now
is, between these two brakes; and the fact that both of them are
American has been made to enter largely into it, and in a way also
which at times lent to the discussion an element of broad humor.For instance, the energetic agent of the Smith vacuum, feeling
himself aggrieved by some statement which appeared in the _Times_,
responded thereto in a circular, in the composition of which he
certainly evinced more zeal than either judgment or literary skill.This circular and its author were then referred to by the editors
of _Engineering_, a London scientific journal, in the following
slightly _de haut en bas_ style:--

     "It is not a little remarkable, and it is a fact not harmonious
     with the feelings of English engineers, that the two brakes
     recommending themselves for adoption are of American origin.* * * Now we cannot wonder, considering what our past experience
     has been in many of our dealings with Americans, that this
     feeling of distrust and prejudice exists.It is not merely
     sentimental, it is founded on many and untoward and costly
     experiences of the past, and the fear of similar experiences in
     the future.And when we see the representative of one of these
     systems adopting the traditional policy of his country, and
     meeting criticism with abuse--abuse of men pre-eminent in the
     profession, and journals which he apparently forgets are neither
     American nor venal--we do not wonder that our railway engineers
     feel a repugnance to commit themselves."The superiority of the British over the American controversialist,
as respects courtesy and restraint in language, being thus
satisfactorily established, it only remained to illustrate it.This, however, had already been done in the previous May; for at
that time it chanced that Captain Tyler, having retired from his
position at the head of the railway inspectors department of the
Board of Trade, was considering an offer which Mr.Westinghouse had
made him to associate himself with the company owning the brakes
known by that name.Before accepting this offer, Captain Tyler
took advantage of a meeting of the Society of Arts to publicly
give notice that he was considering it.This he did in a really
admirable paper on the whole subject of continuous brakes, at the
close of which a general discussion was invited and took place, and
in the course of it the innate superiority of the British over any
other kind of controversialist, so far at least as courtesy and a
delicate refraining from imputations is concerned, received pointed
illustration.Houghton, C. E., took
occasion to refer to the paper he had read as "an elaborate puff
to the Westinghouse brake, with which he [Tyler] was, as he told,
connected, or about to be."Steele proceeded to say
that:--

     "On receiving the invitation to be present at the meeting, he
     had been somewhat afraid that Captain Tyler was going to lose
     his fine character for impartiality by throwing in his lot with
     the brake-tinkers, but it came out that not only was he going to
     do that, but actually going to be a partner in a concern.* * *
     The speaker then proceeded to discuss the Westinghouse brake,
     which he called the Westinghouse and Tyler brake, designating
     it as a jack-in-the-box, a rattle trap, to please and decoy,
     and not an invention at all.No engineer had a hand in its
     manufacture.It was the discovery of some Philadelphia barber
     or some such thing.This was
     a brake which had all sorts of pretensions.It had not worked
     well, but whenever there was any row about its not working
     well, they got the papers to praise it up, and that was how the
     papers were under the thumb, and would not speak of any other.* * * He thought it would not do for railway companies to take
     a bad brake, and Captain Tyler and Mr.Westinghouse be able
     to make their fortunes by floating a limited company for its
     introduction.They had heard of Emma mines and Lisbon tramways,
     and such like, and he felt it would not be well to stand by and
     allow this to be done."All of which was not only to the point, but finely calculated to
show the American inventors and agents who were present the nice and
mutually respectful manner in which such discussions were carried on
by all Englishmen.Though the avowed adhesion of Sir Henry Tyler to the Westinghouse
was a most important move in the war of the brakes, it did not
prove a decisive one.The complete control of the field was too
valuable a property to be yielded in deference to that, or any other
name without a struggle; and, so to speak, there were altogether
too many ins and outs to the conflict.Back door influences had
everywhere to be encountered.The North Western, for instance, is
the most important of the railway companies of the United Kingdom.The locomotive superintendent of that company was the part inventor
and proprietor of an emergency brake which had been extensively
adopted by it on its rolling stock, but which wholly failed to meet
the requirements laid down in its circular by the Board of Trade.Immediately after issuing that circular the Board of Trade called
the attention of the company to this fact in connection with an
accident which had recently occurred, and in very emphatic language
pointed out that the brakes in question could not "in any reasonable
sense of the word be called continuous brakes," and that it was
clear that the circular requirements were "not complied with by the
brake-system of the London & North Western Railway Company;" in case
that company persisted in the use of that brake, the secretary of
the Board went on to say, "in the event of a casualty occurring,
which an efficient system of brakes might have prevented, a heavy
personal responsibility will rest upon those who are answerable for
such neglect."This was certainly language tolerably direct in its
import.As such it was calculated to cause those to whom it was
addressed to pause in their action.The company, however, treated it
with a superb disregard, all the more contemptuous because veiled
in language of deferential civility.They then quietly went on
applying their locomotive superintendent's emergency brake to their
equipment, until on the 30th of June, 1879, they returned no less
than 2,052 carriages fitted with it; that being by far the largest
number returned by any one company in the United Kingdom.A more direct challenge to the Board of Trade and to Parliament
could not easily have been devised.To appreciate how direct it
was, it is necessary to bear in mind that in its circular of August
30, 1877, in which the requirements of a satisfactory train-brake
were laid down, the Board of Trade threw out to the companies
the very significant hint, that they "would do well to reflect
that if a doubt should arise that from a conflict of interest or
opinion, or from any other cause, they [the companies] are not
exerting themselves, it is obvious that they will call down upon
themselves an interference which the Board of Trade, no less than
the companies, desire to avoid."In his general report on the
accidents of the year 1877, the successor of Captain Tyler expressed
the opinion that "sufficient information and experience would now
appear to be available, and the time is approaching when the railway
companies may fairly be expected to come to a decision as to which
of the systems of continuous brakes is best calculated to fulfil the
requisite conditions, and is most worthy of general adoption."At
the close of another year, however, the official returns seemed to
indicate that, while but a sixth part of the passenger locomotives
and a fifth part of the carriages in use on the railroads of the
United Kingdom were yet equipped with continuous brakes at all, a
concurrence of opinion in favor of any one system was more remote
than ever.During the six months ending December 31, 1878, but 127
additional locomotives out of about 4000, and 1,200 additional
carriages out of some 32,000 were equipped; of which 70 locomotives
and 530 carriages had been equipped with the Smith vacuum, which in
three most important respects failed to comply with the Board of
Trade requirements.Under these circumstances the Board of Trade
was obviously called upon either to withdraw from the position it
had taken, or to invite that "interference" in its support to which
in its circular of August, 1877 it had so portentously referred.It
decided to do the latter, and in March, 1879 the government gave an
intimation in the House of Lords that early Parliamentary action was
contemplated.As it is expressed, the railway companies are to "be
relieved of their indecision."In Great Britain, therefore, the long battle of the brakes would
seem to be drawing to its close.The final struggle, however,
will be a spirited one, and one which Americans will watch with
considerable interest,--for it is in fact a struggle between two
American brakes, the Westinghouse and the Smith vacuum.Of the
907 locomotives hitherto equipped with the continuous brakes no
less than 819 are equipped with one or the other of these American
patents, besides over 4,464 of the 9,919 passenger carriages.The
remaining 3,857 locomotives and 30,000 carriages are the prize of
victory.As the score now stands the vacuum brake is in almost
exactly twice the use of its more scientific rival.The weight
of authority and experience, and the requirements of the Board of
Trade, are, however, on the opposite side.As deduced from the European scientific tests and the official
returns, the balance of advantages would seem to be as follows:--In
favor of the vacuum are its superficial simplicity, and possible
economy in first cost:--In favor of the Westinghouse automatic are
its superior quickness in application, the greater rapidity in
its stopping power, the more durable nature of its materials, the
smaller cost in renewal, its less liability to derangement, and
above all its self-acting adjustment.The last is the point upon
which the final issue of the struggle must probably turn.The use
of any train-brake which is not automatic in its action, as has
already been pointed out, involves in the long run disaster,--and
ultimate serious disaster.The mere fact that the brake is generally
so reliable,--that ninety-nine times out of the hundred it works
perfectly,--simply makes disaster certain by the fatal confidence
it inspires.Ninety-nine times in a hundred the brake proves
reliable;--nine times in the remaining ten of the thousand, in which
it fails, a lucky chance averts disaster;--but the thousandth time
will assuredly come, as it did at Communipaw and on the New York
Elevated railway, and, much the worst of all yet, at Wollaston.Soon or late the use of non-automatic continuous brakes will most
assuredly, if they are not sooner abandoned, be put an end to
by the occurrence of some not-to-be forgotten catastrophe of the
first magnitude, distinctly traceable to that cause.Meanwhile that
automatic brakes are complicated and sometimes cause inconvenience
in their operation is most indisputable.This is an objection, also,
to which they are open in common with most of the riper results of
human ingenuity;--but, though sun-dials are charmingly simple, we do
not, therefore, discard chronometers in their favor; neither do we
insist on cutting our harvests with the scythe, because every man
who may be called upon to drive a mowing machine may not know how
to put one together.But what Sir Henry Tyler has said in respect
to this oldest and most fallacious, as well as most wearisome, of
objections covers the whole ground and cannot be improved upon.After referring to the fact that simplicity in construction and
simplicity in working were two different things, and that, almost
invariably, a certain degree of complication in construction is
necessary to secure simplicity in working,--after pointing this out
he went on to add that,--

     "Simplicity as regards the application of railway brakes is
     not obtained by the system now more commonly employed of
     brake-handles to be turned by different men in different
     parts of the train; but is obtained when, by more complicated
     construction an engine-driver is able easily in an instant to
     apply ample brake-power at pleasure with more or less force
     to every wheel of his train; is obtained when, every time an
     engine-driver starts, or attempts to start his train, the brake
     itself informs him if it is out of order; and is still more
     obtained when, on the occasion of an accident and the separation
     of a coupling, the brakes will unfailingly apply themselves on
     every wheel of the train without the action of the engine-driver
     or guards, [brakemen], and before even they have time to realize
     the necessity for it.This is true simplicity in such a case,
     and that system of continuous brakes which best accomplishes
     such results in the shortest space of time is so far preferable
     to all others."THE RAILROAD JOURNEY RESULTING IN DEATH.One day in May, 1847, as the Queen of Belgium was going from
Verviers to Brussels by rail, the train in which she was journeying
came into collision with another train going in the opposite
direction.There was naturally something of a panic, and, as
royalty was not then accustomed to being knocked about with
railroad equality, some of her suite urged the queen to leave the
train and to finish her journey by carriage.The contemporaneous
court reporter then went on to say, in that language which is
so peculiarly his own,--"But her Majesty, as courageously as
discreetly, declined to set that example of timidity, and she
proceeded to Brussels by the railway."In those days a very
exaggerated idea was universally entertained of the great danger
incident to travel by rail.Even then, however, had her Majesty, who
was doubtless a very sensible woman, happened to be familiar with
the statistics of injuries received by those traveling respectively
by rail and by carriage, she certainly never on any plea of danger
would have been induced to abandon her railroad train in order to
trust herself behind horse-flesh.By pursuing the course urged
upon her, the queen would have multiplied her chances of accident
some sixty fold.Strange as the statement sounds even now, such
would seem to have been the fact.In proportion to the whole number
carried, the accidents to passengers in "the good old days of
stage-coaches" were, as compared to the present time of the railroad
dispensation, about as sixty to one.This result, it is true, cannot
be verified in the experience either of England or of this country,
for neither the English nor we possess any statistics in relation
to the earlier period; but they have such statistics in France,
stretching over the space of more than forty years, and as reliable
as statistics ever are.If these French statistics hold true in New
England,--and considering the character of our roads, conveyances,
and climate, their showing is more likely to be in our favor than
against us,--if they simply hold true, leaving us to assume that
stage-coach traveling was no less safe in Massachusetts than in
France, then it would follow that to make the dangers of the rail
of the present day equal to those of the highway of half a century
back, some eighty passengers should annually be killed and some
eleven hundred injured within the limits of Massachusetts alone.These figures, however, represent rather more than fifty times the
actual average, and from them it would seem to be not unfair to
conclude that, notwithstanding the great increase of population and
the yet greater increase in travel during the last half-century,
there were literally more persons killed and injured each year in
Massachusetts fifty years ago through accidents to stage-coaches
than there are now through accidents to railroad trains.The first impression of nine out of ten persons in no way connected
with the operations of railroads would probably be found to be
the exact opposite to this.A vague but deeply rooted conviction
commonly prevails that the railroad has created a new danger;
that because of it the average human being's hold on life is more
precarious than it was.The first point-blank, bald statement to the
contrary would accordingly strike people in the light not only of a
paradox, but of a somewhat foolish one.Investigation, nevertheless,
bears it out.The fact is that when a railroad accident comes, it is
apt to come in such a way as to leave no doubt whatever in relation
to it.It is heralded like a battle or an earthquake; it fills
columns of the daily press with the largest capitals and the most
harrowing details, and thus it makes a deep and lasting impression
on the minds of many people.When a multitude of persons, traveling
as almost every man now daily travels himself, meet death in such
sudden and such awful shape, the event smites the imagination.People seeing it and thinking of it, and hearing and reading of
it, and of it only, forget of how infrequent occurrence it is.It
was not so in the olden time.Every one rode behind horses,--if not
in public then in private conveyances,--and when disaster came it
involved but few persons and was rarely accompanied by circumstances
which either struck the imagination or attracted any great public
notice.In the first place, the modern newspaper, with its perfect
machinery for sensational exaggeration, did not then exist,--having
itself only recently come in the train of the locomotive;--and, in
the next place, the circle of those included in the consequences of
any disaster was necessarily small.For
weeks and months the vast machinery moves along, doing its work
quickly, swiftly, safely; no one pays any attention to it, while
millions daily make use of it.It is as much a necessity of their
lives as the food they eat and the air they breathe.Suddenly,
somehow, and somewhere,--at Versailles, at Norwalk, at Abergele, at
New Hamburg, or at Revere,--at some hitherto unfamiliar point upon
an insignificant thread of the intricate iron web, an obstruction is
encountered, a jar, as it were, is felt, and instantly, with time
for hardly an ejaculation or a thought, a multitude of human beings
are hurled into eternity.It is no cause for surprise that such an
event makes the community in which it happens catch its breadth;
neither is it unnatural that people should think more of the few who
are killed, of whom they hear so much, than of the myriads who are
carried in safety and of whom they hear nothing.Yet it is well to
bear in mind that there are two sides to that question also, and in
no way could this fact be more forcibly brought to our notice than
by the assertion, borne out by all the statistics we possess, that,
irrespective of the vast increase in the number of those who travel,
a greater number of passengers in stage-coaches were formerly
each year killed or injured by accidents to which they in no way
contributed through their own carelessness, than are now killed
under the same conditions in our railroad cars.In other words, the
introduction of the modern railroad, so far from proportionately
increasing the dangers of traveling, has absolutely diminished them.It is not, after all, the dangers but the safety of the modern
railroad which should excite our special wonder.What is the average length of the railroad journey resulting in
death by accident to a prudent traveler?--What is the average length
of one resulting in some personal injury to him?--These are two
questions which interest every one.Few persons, probably, start
upon any considerable journey, implying days and nights on the
rail, without almost unconsciously taking into some consideration
the risks of accident.Visions of collision, derailment, plunging
through bridges, will rise unbidden.Even the old traveler who
has enjoyed a long immunity is apt at times, with some little
apprehension, to call to mind the musty adage of the pitcher and
the well, and to ask himself how much longer it will be safe for
him to rely on his good luck.A hundred thousand miles, perhaps,
and no accident yet!--Surely, on every doctrine of chances, he
now owes to fate an arm or a leg;--perhaps a life.The statistics
of a long series of years enable us, however, to approximate with
a tolerable degree of precision to an answer to these questions,
and the answer is simply astounding;--so astounding, in fact,
that, before undertaking to give it, the question itself ought to
be stated with all possible precision.It is this:--Taking all
persons who as passengers travel by rail,--and this includes all
dwellers in civilized countries,--what number of journeys of the
average length are safely accomplished, to each one which results
in the death or injury of a passenger from some cause over which he
had no control?--The cases of death or injury must be confined to
passengers, and to those of them only who expose themselves to no
unnecessary risk.When approaching a question of this sort, statisticians are apt to
assume for their answers an appearance of mathematical accuracy.It is needless to say that this is a mere affectation.The best
results which can be arrived at are, after all, mere approximations,
and they also vary greatly year by year.The body of facts from
which conclusions are to be deduced must cover not only a definite
area of space, but also a considerable lapse of time.Even Great
Britain, with its 17,000 miles of track and its hundreds of millions
of annual passenger journeys, shows results which, one year with
another, vary strangely.For instance, during the four years
anterior to 1874, but one passenger was killed, upon an average, to
each 11,000,000 carried; while in 1874 the proportion, under the
influence of a succession of disasters, suddenly doubled, rising to
one in every 5,500,000; and then again in 1877, a year of peculiar
exemption, it fell off to one in every 50,000,000.The percentage of
fatal casualties to the whole number carried was in 1847-9 five fold
what it was in 1878.If such fluctuations reveal themselves in the
statistics of Great Britain, those met with in the narrower field of
a single state in this country might well seem at first glance to
set all computation at defiance.During the ten years, for example,
between 1861 and 1870, about 200,000,000 passengers were returned
as carried on the Massachusetts roads, with 135 cases of injury to
individuals.Then came the year of the Revere disaster, and out of
26,000,000 carried, no less than 115 were killed or injured.Seven
years of comparative immunity then ensued, during which, out of
240,000,000 carried, but two were killed and forty-five injured.In other words, through a period of ten years the casualties were
approximately as one to 1,500,000; then during a single year they
rose to one in 250,000, or a seven-fold increase; and then through
a period of seven years they diminished to one in 3,400,000, a
decrease of about ninety per cent.Taking, however, the very worst of years,--the year of the
Revere disaster, which stands unparalleled in the history of
Massachusetts,--it will yet be found that the answer to the question
as to the length of the average railroad journey resulting in death
or in injury will be expressed, not in thousands nor in hundreds
of thousands of miles, but in millions.During that year some
26,000,000 passenger journeys were made within the limits of the
state, and each journey averaged a distance of about 13 miles.It
would seem, therefore, that, even in that year, the average journey
resulting in death was 11,000,000 miles, while that resulting either
in death or personal injury was not less than 3,300,000.The year 1871, however, represented by no means a fair average.On the contrary, it indicated what may fairly be considered an
excessive degree of danger, exciting nervous apprehensions in the
breasts of those even who were not constitutionally timid.To reach
what may be considered a normal average, therefore, it would be
more proper to include a longer period in the computation.Take,
for instance, the nine years, 1871-79, during which alone has
any effort been made to reach statistical accuracy in respect to
Massachusetts railroad accidents.During those nine years, speaking
in round numbers and making no pretence at anything beyond a
general approximation, some 303,000,000 passenger journeys of 13
miles each have been made on the railroads and within the state.Of these 51 have resulted in death and 308 in injuries to persons
from causes over which they had no control.The average distance,
therefore, traveled by all, before death happened to any one, was
about 80,000,000 miles, and that travelled before any one was either
injured or killed was about 10,800,000.The Revere disaster of 1871, however, as has been seen, brought
about important changes in the methods of operating the railroads
of Massachusetts.Consequently the danger incident to railroad
traveling was materially reduced; and in the next eight years
(1872-9) some 274,000,000 passenger journeys were made within the
limits of the state.The Wollaston disaster of October, 1878, was
included in this period, during which 223 persons were injured and
21 were killed.The average journey for these years resulting in any
injury to a passenger was close upon 15,000,000 miles, while that
resulting in death was 170,000,000.But it may fairly be asked,--What, after all, do these figures
mean?--They are, indeed, so large as to exceed comprehension; for,
after certain comparatively narrow limits are passed the practical
infinite is approached, and the mere adding of a few more ciphers
after a numeral conveys no new idea.On the contrary, the piling up
of figures rather tends to weaken than to strengthen a statement,
for to many it suggests an idea of ridiculous exaggeration.Indeed,
when a few years ago a somewhat similar statement to that just made
was advanced in an official report, a critic undertook to expose
the fallacy of it in the columns of a daily paper by referring to a
case within the writer's own observation in which a family of three
persons had been killed on their very first journey in a railroad
car.It is not, of course, necessary to waste time over such a
criticism as this.Railroad accidents continually take place, and
in consequence of them people are killed and injured, and of these
there may well be some who are then making their first journey by
rail; but in estimating the dangers of railroad traveling the much
larger number who are not killed or injured at all must likewise be
taken into consideration.Any person as he may be reading this page
in a railroad car may be killed or injured through some accident,
even while his eye is glancing over the figures which show how
infinitesimal his danger is; but the chances are none the less as a
million to one that any particular reader will go down to his grave
uninjured by any accident on the rail, unless it be occasioned by
his or her own carelessness.Admitting, therefore, that ill luck or hard fortune must fall to
the lot of certain unascertainable persons, yet the chances of
incurring that ill fortune are so small that they are not materially
increased by any amount of traveling which can be accomplished
within the limits of a human life.So far from exhausting a fair
average immunity from accident by constant traveling, the statistics
of Massachusetts during the last eight years would seem to indicate
that if any given person were born upon a railroad car, and remained
upon it traveling 500 miles a day all his life, he would, with
average good fortune, be somewhat over 80 years of age before he
would be involved in any accident resulting in his death or personal
injury, while he would attain the highly respectable age of 930
years before being killed.Even supposing that the most exceptional
average of the Revere year became usual, a man who was killed by
an accident at 70 years of age should, unless he were fairly to be
accounted unlucky, have accomplished a journey of some 440 miles
every day of his life, Sundays included, from the time of his birth
to that of his death; while even to have brought him within the
fair liability of any injury at all, his daily journey should have
been some 120 miles.Under the conditions of the last eight years
his average daily journey through the three score years and ten to
entitle him to be killed in an accident at the end of them would be
about 600 miles.THE RAILROAD DEATH RATE.In connection with the statistics of railroad casualties it is not
without interest to examine the general vital statistics of some
considerable city, for they show clearly enough what a large degree
of literal truth there was in the half jocose proposition attributed
to John Bright, that the safest place in which a man could put
himself was inside a first-class railroad carriage of a train in
full motion.Take the statistics of Boston, for instance, for the
year 1878.During the four years 1875-8, it will be remembered, a
single passenger only was killed on the railroads of Massachusetts
in consequence of an accident to which he by his own carelessness
in no way contributed.[27] The average number of persons annually
injured, not fatally, during those years was about five.[27] This period did not include the Wollaston disaster, as the
  Massachusetts railroad year closes on the last day of September.The
  Wollaston disaster occurred on the 8th of October, 1878, and was
  accordingly included in the next railroad year.Yet during the year 1878, excluding all cases of mere injury of
which no account was made, no less than 53 persons came to their
deaths in Boston from falling down stairs, and 37 more from falling
out of windows; seven were scalded to death in 1878 alone.In the
year 1874 seventeen were killed by being run over by teams in
the streets, while the pastime of coasting was carried on at a
cost of ten lives more.During the five years 1874-8 there were
more persons murdered in the city of Boston alone than lost their
lives as passengers through the negligence of all the railroad
corporations in the whole state of Massachusetts during the nine
years 1871-8; though in those nine years were included both the
Revere and the Wollaston disasters, the former of which resulted
in the death of 29, and the latter of 21 persons.Neither are the
comparative results here stated in any respect novel or peculiar
to Massachusetts.Years ago it was officially announced in France
that people were less safe in their own houses than while traveling
on the railroads; and, in support of this somewhat startling
proposition, statistics were produced showing fourteen cases of
death of persons remaining at home and there falling over carpets,
or, in the case of females, having their garments catch fire, to ten
deaths on the rail.Even the game of cricket counted eight victims
to the railroad's ten.It will not, of course, be inferred that the cases of death or
injury to passengers from causes beyond their control include
by any means all the casualties involved in the operation of the
railroad system.On the contrary, they include but a very small
portion of them.The experience of the Massachusetts roads during
the seven years between September 30, 1871, and September 30,
1878, may again be cited in reference to this point.During that
time there were but 52 cases of injury to passengers from causes
over which they had no control, but in connection with the entire
working of the railroad system no less than 1,900 cases of injury
were reported, of which 1,008 were fatal; an average of 144 deaths a
year.Of these cases, naturally, a large proportion were employés,
whose occupation not only involves much necessary risk, but whose
familiarity with risk causes them always to incur it even in the
most unnecessary and foolhardy manner.During the seven years 293
of them were killed and 375 were reported as injured.Nor is it
supposed that the list included by any means all the cases of injury
which occurred.About one half of the accidents to employés are
occasioned by their falling from the trains when in motion, usually
from freight trains and in cold weather, and from being crushed
between cars while engaged in coupling them together.From this last
cause alone an average of 27 casualties are annually reported.One
fact, however, will sufficiently illustrate how very difficult it is
to protect this class of men from danger, or rather from themselves.As is well known, on freight trains they are obliged to ride on the
tops of the cars; but these are built so high that their roofs come
dangerously near the bottoms of the highway bridges, which cross
the track sometimes in close proximity to each other.Accordingly
many unfortunate brakemen were killed by being knocked off the
trains as they passed under these bridges.With a view to affording
the utmost possible protection against this form of accident, a
statute was passed by the Massachusetts legislature compelling the
corporations to erect guards at a suitable distance from every
overhead bridge which was less than eighteen feet in the clear
above the track.These guards were so arranged as to swing lightly
across the tops of the cars, giving any one standing upon them a
sharp rap, warning him of the danger he was in.This warning rap,
however, so annoyed the brakemen that the guards were on a number of
the roads systematically destroyed as often as they were put up; so
that at last another law had to be passed, making their destruction
a criminal offense.The brakemen themselves resisted the attempt
to divest their perilous occupation of one of its most insidious
dangers.In this respect, however, brakemen differ in no degree from the
rest of the community.On all hands railroad accidents seem to
be systematically encouraged, and the wonder is that the list of
casualties is not larger.In Massachusetts, for instance, even in
the most crowded portions of the largest cities and towns, not
only do the railroads cross the highways at grade, but whenever new
thoroughfares are laid out the people of the neighborhood almost
invariably insist upon their crossing the railroads at a grade
and not otherwise.Not but that, upon theory and in the abstract,
every one is opposed to grade-crossings; but those most directly
concerned always claim that their particular crossing is exceptional
in character.In vain do corporations protest and public officials
argue; when the concrete case arises all neighborhoods become alike
and strenuously insist on their right to incur everlasting danger
rather than to have the level of their street broken.During the
last seven years to September 30, 1878, 191 persons have been
injured, and 98 of them fatally injured, at these crossings in
Massachusetts, and it is certain as fate that the number is destined
to annually increase.What the result in a remote future will be, it
is not now easy to forecast.One thing only would seem certain: the
time will come when the two classes of traffic thus recklessly made
to cross each other will at many points have to be separated, no
matter at what cost to the community which now challenges the danger
it will then find itself compelled to avoid.The heaviest and most regular cause of death and injury involved
in the operation of the railroad system yet remains to be referred
to; and again it is recklessness which is at the root of it, and
this time recklessness in direct violation of law.The railroad
tracks are everywhere favorite promenades, and apparently even
resting-places, especially for those who are more or less drunk.In Great Britain physical demolition by a railroad train is also a
somewhat favorite method of committing suicide, and that, too, in
the most deliberate and cool-blooded manner.Cases have not been
uncommon in which persons have been seen to coolly lay themselves
down in front of an advancing train, and very neatly effect their
own decapitation by placing their necks across the rail.In England
alone, during the last seven years, there have been no less than 280
cases of death reported under the head of suicides, or an average
of 40 each year, the number in 1878 rising to 60.In America these
cases are not returned in a class by themselves.Under the general
head of accidents to trespassers, however, that is, accidents to
men, women and children, especially the latter, illegally lying,
walking, or playing on the tracks or riding upon the cars,--under
this head are regularly classified more than one third of all
the casualties incident to working the Massachusetts railroads.During the last seven years these have amounted to an aggregate
of 724 cases of injury, no less than 494 of which were fatal.Of
course, very many other cases of this description, which were not
fatal, were never reported.And here again the recklessness of the
public has received further illustration, and this time in a very
unpleasant way.Certain corporations operating roads terminating
in Boston endeavored at one time to diminish this slaughter by
enforcing the laws against walking on railroad tracks.A few
trespassers were arrested and fined, and then the resentment of
those whose wonted privileges were thus interfered with began to
make itself felt.Obstructions were found placed in the way of night
trains.The mere attempt to keep people from risking their lives
by getting in the way of locomotives placed whole trains full of
passengers in imminent jeopardy.Undoubtedly, however, by far the most effective means of keeping
railroad tracks from becoming foot-paths, and thus at once putting
an end to the largest item in the grand total of the expenditure
of life incident to the operation of railroads, is that secured
by the Pennsylvania railroad as an unintentional corollary to its
method of ballasting.That superb organization, every detail of
whose wonderful system is a fit subject for study to all interested
in the operation of railroads, has a roadway peculiar to itself.A principal feature in this is a surface of broken stone ballast,
covering not only the space between the rails, but also the interval
between the tracks as well as the road-bed on the outside of each
track for a distance of some three feet.It resembles nothing so
much as a newly macadamized highway.That, too, is its permanent
condition.To walk on the sharp and uneven edges of this broken
stone is possible, with a sufficient expenditure of patience and
shoe-leather; but certainly no human being would ever walk there
from preference, or if any other path could be found.Not only is
it in itself, as a system of ballasting, looked upon as better than
any other, but it confounds the tramp.Its systematic adoption in
crowded, suburban neighborhoods would, therefore, answer a double
purpose.It would secure to the corporations permanent road-beds
exclusively for their own use, and obviate the necessity of arrests
or futile threats to enforce the penalties of the law against
trespassers.It seems singular that this most obvious and effective
way of putting a stop to what is both a nuisance and a danger has
not yet been resorted to by men familiar with the use of spikes and
broken glass on the tops of fences and walls.Meanwhile, taken even in its largest aggregate, the loss of life
incident to the working of the railroad system is not excessive, nor
is it out of proportion to what might reasonably be expected.It is
to be constantly borne in mind, not only that the railroad performs
a great function in modern life, but that it also and of necessity
performs it in a very dangerous way.A practically irresistible
force crashing through the busy hive of modern civilization at a
wild rate of speed, going hither and thither, across highways and
by-ways and along a path which is in itself a thoroughfare,--such an
agency cannot be expected to work incessantly and yet never to come
in contact with the human frame.Naturally, however, it might be a
very car of Juggernaut.Is it so in fact?--To demonstrate that it
is not, it is but necessary again to recur to the comparison between
the statistics of railroad accidents and those which necessarily
occur in the experience of all considerable cities.Take again those
of Boston and of the railroad system of Massachusetts.These for the
purpose of illustration are as good as any, and in their results
would only be confirmed in the experience of Paris as compared with
the railroad system of France, or in that of London as compared with
the railroad system of Great Britain.During the eight years between
September 30, 1870, and September 30, 1878, the entire railroad
system of Massachusetts was operated at a cost of 1,165 lives, apart
from all cases of injury which did not prove fatal.The returns in
this respect also may be accepted as reasonably accurate, as the
deaths were all returned, though the cases of merely personal injury
probably were not.During the ten
years, 1868-78, 2,587 cases of death from accidental causes, or 259
a year, were recorded as having taken place in the city of Boston.In other words, the annual average of deaths by accident in the city
of Boston alone exceeds that consequent on running all the railroads
of the state by eighty per cent.Unless, therefore, the railroad
system is to be considered as an exception to all other functions of
modern life, and as such is to be expected to do its work without
injury to life or limb, this showing does not constitute a very
heavy indictment against it.AMERICAN AS COMPARED WITH FOREIGN RAILROAD ACCIDENTS.Up to this point, the statistics and experience of Massachusetts
only have been referred to.This is owing to the fact that the
railroad returns of that state are more carefully prepared and
tabulated than are those of any other state, and afford, therefore,
more satisfactory data from which to draw conclusions.The
territorial area from which the statistics are in this case derived
is very limited, and it yet remains to compare the results deduced
from them with those derived from the similar experience of other
communities.This, however, is not an easy thing to do; and, while
it is difficult enough as respects Europe, it is even more difficult
as respects America taken as a whole.This last fact is especially
unfortunate in view of the circumstance that, in regard to railway
accidents, the United States, whether deservedly or not, enjoy a
most undesirable reputation.Foreign authorities have a way of
referring to our "well-known national disregard of human life," with
a sort of complacency, at once patronizing and contemptuous, which
is the reverse of pleasing.Judging by the tone of their comments,
the natural inference would be that railroad disasters of the worst
description were in America matters of such frequent occurrence
as to excite scarcely any remark.As will presently be made very
apparent, this impression, for it is only an impression, can, so
far as the country as a whole is concerned, neither be proved nor
disproved, from the absence of sufficient data from which to argue.As respects Massachusetts, however, and the same statement may
perhaps be made of the whole belt of states north of the Potomac and
the Ohio, there is no basis for it.There is no reason to suppose
that railroad traveling is throughout that region accompanied by any
peculiar or unusual degree of danger.The great difficulty, just referred to, in comparing the results
deduced from equally complete statistics of different countries,
lies in the variety of the arbitrary rules under which the
computations in making them up are effected.As an example in
point, take the railroad returns of Great Britain and those of
Massachusetts.They are in each case prepared with a great deal
of care, and the results deduced from them may fairly be accepted
as approximately correct.As respects accidents, the number of
cases of death and of personal injury are annually reported, and
with tolerable completeness, though in the latter respect there is
probably in both cases room for improvement.The whole comparison
turns, however, on the way in which the entire number of passengers
annually carried is computed.In Great Britain, for instance, in
1878, these were returned, using round numbers only, at 565,000,000,
and in Massachusetts at 34,000,000.By dividing these totals by
the number of cases of death and injury reported as occurring
to passengers from causes beyond their control, we shall arrive
apparently at a fair comparative showing as to the relative safety
of railroad traveling in the two communities.The result for that
particular year would have been that while in Great Britain one
passenger in each 23,500,000 was killed, and one in each 481,600
injured from causes beyond their control, in Massachusetts none
were killed and only one in each 14,000,000 was in any way injured.Unfortunately, however, a closer examination reveals a very great
error in the computation, affecting every comparative result drawn
from it.In the English returns no allowance whatever is made
for the very large number of journeys made by season-ticket or
commutation passengers, while in Massachusetts, on the contrary,
each person of this class enters into the grand total as making two
trips each day, 156 trips on each quarterly ticket, and 626 trips on
each annual.Now in 1878 more than 418,000 holders of season tickets
were returned by the railway companies of Great Britain.How many
of these were quarterly and how many were annual travelers, does not
appear.If they were all annual travelers, no less than 261,000,000
journeys should be added to the 565,000,000 in the returns, in order
to arrive at an equal basis for a comparison between the foreign
and the American roads: this method, however, would be manifestly
inaccurate, so it only remains, in the absence of all reliable data,
and for the purpose of comparison solely, to strike out from the
Massachusetts returns the 8,320,727 season-ticket passages, which at
once reduces by over 3,000,000 the number of journeys to each case
of injury.As season-ticket passengers do travel and are exposed to
danger in the same degree as trip-ticket passengers, no result is
approximately accurate which leaves them out of the computation.At
present, however, the question relates not to the positive danger or
safety of traveling by rail, but to its relative danger in different
communities.Allowance for this discrepancy can, however, be made by adding to
the English official results an additional nineteen per cent., that,
according to the returns of 1877 and 1878, being the proportion
of the season-ticket to other passengers on the roads of Great
Britain.Taking then the Board of Trade returns for the eight
years 1870-7, it will be found that during this period about one
passenger in each 14,500,000 carried in that country has been killed
in railroad accidents, and about one in each 436,000 injured.This may be assumed as a fair average for purpose of comparison,
though it ought to be said that in Great Britain the percentage of
casualties to passengers shows a decided tendency to decrease, and
during the years 1877-8 the percentages of killed fell from one in
15,000,000 to one in 38,000,000 and those of injured from one in
436,000 to one in 766,000.The aggregates from which these results
are deduced are so enormous, rising into the thousands of millions,
that a certain degree of reliance can be placed on them.In the
case of Massachusetts, however, the entire period during which the
statistics are entitled to the slightest weight includes only eight
years, 1872-9, and offers an aggregate of but 274,000,000 journeys,
or but about forty per cent.of those included in the British
returns of the single year 1878.During these years the killed in
Massachusetts were one in each 13,000,000 and the injured one in
each 1,230,000;--or, while the killed in the two cases were very
nearly in the same proportion,--respectively one in 14.5, and one in
13, speaking in millions,--the British injured were really three to
one of the Massachusetts.The equality as respects the killed in this comparison, and the
marked discrepancy as respects the injured is calculated at first
sight to throw doubts on the fullness of the Massachusetts returns.There seems no good reason why the injured should in the one case
be so much more numerous than in the other.This, however, is
susceptible on closer examination of a very simple and satisfactory
explanation.In case of accident the danger of sustaining slight
personal injury is not so great in Massachusetts as in Great
Britain.This is due to the heavier and more solid construction
of the American passenger coaches, and their different interior
arrangement.This fact, and the real cause of the large number of
slightly injured,--"shaken" they call it,--in the English railroad
accidents is made very apparent in the following extract from Mr.Calcroft's report for 1877;--

     "It is no doubt a fact that collisions and other accidents to
     railway trains are attended with less serious consequences
     in proportion to the solidity of construction of passenger
     carriages.The accomodation and internal arrangements of
     third-class carriages, however, especially those used in
     ordinary trains, are defective as regards safety and comfort,
     as compared with many carriages of the same class on foreign
     railways.The first-class passenger, except when thrown against
     his opposite companion, or when some luggage falls upon him, is
     generally saved from severe contusion by the well-stuffed or
     padded linings of the carriages; whilst the second-class and
     third-class passenger is generally thrown with violence against
     the hard wood-work.If the second and third-class carriages
     had a high padded back lining, extending above the head of the
     passenger, it would probably tend to lesson the danger to life
     and limb which, as the returns of accidents show, passengers
     in carriages of this class are much exposed to in train
     accidents."[28]

 [28] _General Report to the Board of Trade upon the accidents which
  have occurred on the Railways of the United Kingdom during the year
  1877, p.37._

In 1878 the passenger journeys made in the second and third class
carriages of the United Kingdom were thirteen to one of those made
in first class carriages;--or, expressed in millions, there were
but 41 of the latter to 523 of the former.There can be very little
question indeed that if, during the last ten years, thirteen out
of fourteen of the passengers on Massachusetts railroads had been
carried in narrow compartments with wooden seats and unlined sides
the number of those returned as slightly injured in the numerous
accidents which occurred would have been at least three-fold larger
than it was.If it had not been ten-fold larger it would have been
surprising.The foregoing comparison, relates however, simply to passengers
killed in accidents for which they are in no degree responsible.When, however, the question reverts to the general cost in life
and limb at which the railroad systems are worked and the railroad
traffic is carried on to the entire communities served, the
comparison is less favorable to Massachusetts.Taking the eight
years of 1871-8, the British returns include 30,641 cases of injury,
and 9,113 of death; while those of Massachusetts for the same
years included 1,165 deaths, with only 1,044 cases of injury; in
the one case a total of 39,745 casualties, as compared with 2,209
the other.It will, however be noticed that while in the British
returns the cases of injury are nearly three-fold those of death, in
the Massachusetts returns the deaths exceed the cases of injury.This fact in the present case cannot but throw grave suspicion
on the completeness of the Massachusetts returns.As a matter of
practical experience it is well known that cases of injury almost
invariably exceed those of death, and the returns in which the
disproportion is greatest, if no sufficient explanation presents
itself, are probably the most full and reliable.Taking, therefore,
the deaths in the two cases as the better basis for comparison, it
will be found that the roads of Great Britain in the grand result
accomplished seventeen-fold the work of those of Massachusetts with
less than eight times as many casualties; had the proportion between
the results accomplished and the fatal injuries inflicted been
maintained, but 536 deaths instead of 1,165 would have appeared in
the Massachusetts returns.The reason of this difference in result
is worth looking for, and fortunately the statistical tables are
in both cases carried sufficiently into detail to make an analysis
possible; and this analysis, when made, seems to indicate very
clearly that while, for those directly connected with the railroads,
either as passengers or as employés, the Massachusetts system
in its working involves relatively a less degree of danger than
that of Great Britain, yet for the outside community it involves
very much more.Take, for instance, the two heads of accidents
at grade-crossings and accidents to trespassers, which have been
already referred to.In Great Britain highway grade-crossings
are discouraged.The results of the policy pursued may in each case be read
with sufficient distinctness in the bills of mortality.During the
years 1872-7, of 1,929 casualties to persons on the railroads of
Massachusetts, no less than 200 occurred at highway grade crossings.Had the accidents of this description in Great Britain been equally
numerous in proportion to the larger volume of the traffic of that
country, they would have resulted in over 3,000 cases of death or
personal injury; they did in fact result in 586 such cases.In
Massachusetts, again, to walk at will on any part of a railroad
track is looked upon as a sort of prescriptive and inalienable
right of every member of the community, irrespective of age, sex,
color, or previous condition of servitude.Accordingly, during the
six years referred to, this right was exercised at the cost of life
or limb to 591 persons,--one in four of all the casualties which
occurred in connection with the railroad system.In Great Britain
the custom of using the tracks of railroads as a foot-path seems to
exist, but, so far from being regarded as a right, it is practiced
in perpetual terror of the law.Accordingly, instead of some 9,000
cases of death or injury from this cause during these six years,
which would have been the proportion under like conditions in
Massachusetts, the returns showed only 2,379.These two are among
the most constant and fruitful causes of accident in connection with
the railroad system of America.In great Britain their proportion
to the whole number of casualties which take place is scarcely a
seventh part of what it is in Massachusetts.Here they constitute
very nearly fifty per cent.of all the accidents which occur; there
they constitute but a little over seven.There is in this comparison
a good deal of solid food for legislative thought, if American
legislators would but take it in; for this is one matter the public
policy in regard to which can only be fixed by law.When we pass from Great Britain to the continental countries of
Europe, the difficulties in the way of any fair comparison of
results become greater and greater.The statistics do not enter
sufficiently into detail, nor is the basis of computation apparent.It is generally conceded that, where a due degree of caution is
exercised by the passenger, railroad traveling in continental
countries is attended with a much less degree of danger than in
England.When we come to the returns, they hardly bear out this
conclusion; at least to the degree commonly supposed.Nowhere is human life more carefully guarded than in
that country; yet their returns show that of 866,000,000 passengers
transported on the French railroads during the eleven years 1859-69,
no less than 65 were killed and 1,285 injured from causes beyond
their control; or one in each 13,000,000 killed as compared with one
in 10,700,000 in Great Britain; and one in every 674,000 injured
as compared with one in each 330,000 in the other country.During
the single year 1859, about 111,000,000 passengers were carried
on the French lines, at a general cost to the community of 2,416
casualties, of which 295 were fatal.In Massachusetts, during the
four years 1871-74, about 95,000,000 passengers were carried, at
a reported cost of 1,158 casualties.This showing might well be
considered favorable to Massachusetts did not the single fact that
her returns included more than twice as many deaths as the French,
with only a quarter as many injuries, make it at once apparent that
the statistics were at fault.Under these circumstances comparison
could only be made between the numbers of deaths reported; which
would indicate that, in proportion to the work done, the railroad
operations of Massachusetts involved about twice and a half more
cases of injury to life and limb than those of the French service.As respects Great Britain the comparison is much more favorable, the
returns showing an almost exactly equal general death-rate in the
two countries in proportion to their volumes of traffic; the volume
of Great Britain being about four times that of France, while its
death-rate by railroad accidents was as 1,100 to 295.With the exception of Belgium, however, in which country the
returns cover only the lines operated by the state, the basis
hardly exists for a useful comparison between the dangers of injury
from accident on the continental railroads and on those of Great
Britain and America.The several systems are operated on wholly
different principles, to meet the needs of communities between
whose modes of life and thought little similarity exists.The
continental trains are far less crowded than either the English or
the American, and, when accidents occur, fewer persons are involved
in them.The movement, also, goes on under much stricter regulation
and at lower rates of speed, so that there is a grain of truth in
the English sarcasm that on a German railway "it almost seems as
if beer-drinking at the stations were the principal business, and
traveling a mere accessory."Limiting, therefore, the comparison to the railroads of Great
Britain, it remains to be seen whether the evil reputation of the
American roads as respects accidents is wholly deserved.Is it
indeed true that the danger to a passenger's life and limbs is so
much greater in this country than elsewhere?--Locally, and so far
as Massachusetts at least is concerned, it certainly is not.How
is it with the country taken as a whole?--The lack of all reliable
statistics as respects this wide field of inquiry has already been
referred to.We do not know with
accuracy even the number of miles of road operated; much less the
number of passengers annually carried.As respects accidents, and
the deaths and injuries resulting therefrom, some information may be
gathered from a careful and very valuable, because the only record
which has been preserved during the last six years in the columns of
the _Railroad Gazette_.It makes, of course, no pretence at either
official accuracy or fullness, but it is as complete probably as
circumstances will permit of its being made.During the five years
1874-8 there have been included in this record 4,846 accidents,
resulting in 1,160 deaths and 4,650 cases of injury;--being an
average of 969 accidents a year, resulting in 232 deaths and 930
cases of injury.These it will be remembered are casualties directly
resulting either to passengers or employés from train accidents.No account is taken of injuries sustained by employés in the
ordinary operation of the roads, or by members of the community
not passengers.In Massachusetts the accidents to passengers and
employés constitute one-half of the whole, but a very small portion
of the injuries reported as sustained by either passengers or
employés are the consequence of train accidents,--not one in three
in the case of passengers or one in seven in that of employés.In
fact, of the 2,350 accidents to persons reported in Massachusetts
in the nine years 1870-8, but 271, or less than twelve per cent.,
belonged to the class alone included in the reports of the _Railroad
Gazette_.In England during the four years 1874-7 the proportion
was larger, being about twenty-five instead of twelve per cent.For
America at large the Massachusetts proportion is undoubtedly the
most nearly correct, and the probabilities would seem to be that
the annual average of injuries to persons incident to operating the
railroads of the United States is not less than 10,000, of which at
least 1,200 are due to train accidents.Of these about two-thirds
may be set down as sustained by passengers, or, approximately, 800 a
year.It remains to be ascertained what proportion this number bears to
the whole number carried.There are no reliable statistics on this
head any more than on the other.Nothing but an approximation of
the most general character is possible.The number of passengers
annually carried on the roads of a few of the states is reported
with more or less accuracy, and averaging these the result would
seem to indicate that there are certainly not more than 350,000,000
passengers annually carried on the roads of all the states.There
is something barbarous about such an approximation, and it is
disgraceful that at this late day we should in America be forced
to estimate the passenger movement on our railroads in much the
same way that we guess at the population of Africa.We are in this respect far in the rear of civilized
communities.Taking, however, 350,000,000 as a fair approximation
to our present annual passenger movement, it will be observed that
it is as nearly as may be half that of Great Britain.In Great
Britain, in 1878, there were 1,200 injuries to passengers from
accidents to trains, and 675 in 1877.The average of the last eight
years has been 1,226.If, therefore, the approximation of 800 a
year for America is at all near the truth, the percentage would seem
to be considerably larger than that arrived at from the statistics
of Great Britain.Meanwhile it is to be noted that while in Great
Britain about 25 cases of injury are reported to each one of death,
in America but four cases are reported to each death--a discrepancy
which is extremely suggestive.Perhaps, however, the most valuable
conclusion to be drawn from these figures is that in America we as
yet are absolutely without any reliable railroad statistics on this
subject at all.Taken as a whole, however, and under the most favorable showing,
it would seem to be a matter of fair inference that the dangers
incident to railroad traveling are materially greater in the United
States than in any country of Europe.How much greater is a question
wholly impossible to answer.So that when a statistical writer
undertakes to show, as one eminent European authority has done, that
in a given year on the American roads one passenger in every 286,179
was killed, and one in every 90,737 was injured, it is charitable
to suppose that in regard to America only is he indebted to his
imagination for his figures.Neither is it possible to analyze with any satisfactory degree of
precision the nature of the accidents in the two countries, with
a view to drawing inferences from them.Without attempting to do
so it maybe said that the English Board of Trade reports for the
last five years, 1874-8, include inquiries into 755 out of 11,585
accidents, the total number of every description reported as having
taken place.Meanwhile the _Railroad Gazette_ contains mention of
4,846 reported train accidents which occurred in America during
the same five years.Of these accidents, 1,310 in America and 81
in Great Britain were due to causes which were either unexplained
or of a miscellaneous character, or are not common to the systems
of the two countries.In so far as the remainder admitted of
classification, it was somewhat as follows:--

  [29] During these five years there were in Great Britain four cases
  of collision between locomotives or trains at level crossings of one
  railroad by another; in America there were 79.The probable cause of
  this discrepancy has already been referred to (_ante pp.The above record, though almost valueless for any purpose of exact
comparison, reveals, it will be noticed, one salient fact.Out of
755 English accidents, no less than 406 came under the head of
collisions--whether head collisions, rear collisions, or collisions
on sidings or at junctions.In other words, to collisions of some
sort between trains were due considerably more than half (54 per
cent.)of the accidents which took place in Great Britain, while
only 88, or less than 13 per cent.of the whole, were due to
derailments from all causes.In America on the other hand, while
of the 3,763 accidents recorded, 1,324, or but one-third part (35
per cent.)were due to collisions, no less than 586, or 24 per
cent., were classed under the head of derailments, due to defects
in the permanent way.During the the six years 1873-8 there were
in all 1698 cases of collision of every description between trains
reported as occurring in America to 1495 in the United Kingdom; but
while in America the derailments amounted to no less than 4016, or
more than twice the collisions, in the United Kingdom they were
but 817, or a little more than half their number.It has already
been noticed that the most disastrous accidents in America are apt
to occur on bridges, and Ashtabula and Tariffville at once suggest
themselves.Under the heading
of "Failures of Tunnels, Bridges, Viaducts or Culverts," there
were returned in that country during the six years 1873-8 only 29
accidents in all; while during the same time in America, under the
heads of broken bridges or tressels and open draws, the _Gazette_
recorded no less than 165.These figures curiously illustrate the
different manner in which the railroads of the two countries have
been constructed, and the different circumstances under which they
are operated.The English collisions are distinctly traceable to
constant overcrowding; the American derailments and bridge accidents
to inferior construction of our road-beds.Finally, what of late years has been done to diminish the dangers
of the rail?--What more can be done?--Few persons realize what a
tremendous pressure in this respect is constantly bearing down upon
those whose business it is to operate railroads.A great accident is
not only a terrible blow to the pride and prestige of a corporation,
not only does it practically ruin the unfortunate officials involved
in it, but it entails also portentous financial consequences.Juries
proverbially have little mercy for railroad corporations, and, when
a disaster comes, these have practically no choice but to follow the
scriptural injunction to settle with their adversaries quickly.The
Revere catastrophe, for instance, cost the railroad company liable
on account of it over half a million of dollars; the Ashtabula
accident over $600,000; the Wollaston over $300,000.A few years ago
in England a jury awarded a sum of $65,000 for damages sustained
through the death of a single individual.During the five years,
1867-71, the railroad corporations of Great Britain paid out over
$11,000,000 in compensation for damages occasioned by accidents.In
view, merely, of such money consequences of disaster, it would be
most unnatural did not each new accident lead to the adoption of
better appliances to prevent its recurrence.[30]

  [30] The other side of this proposition has been argued with
  much force by Mr.William Galt in his report as one of the Royal
  Commission of 1874 on Railway Accidents.Galt's individual
  report bears date February 5, 1877, and in it he asserts that, as
  a matter of actual experience, the principle of self-interest on
  the part of the railway companies has proved a wholly insufficient
  safeguard against accidents.However it may be in theory, he
  contends that, taking into consideration the great cost of the
  appliances necessary to insure safety to the public on the one side,
  and the amount of damages incident to a certain degree of risk on
  the other side, the possible saving in expenditure to the companies
  by assuming the risk far exceeds the loss incurred by an occasional
  accident.The companies become, in a word, insurers of their
  passengers,--the premium being found in the economies effected by
  not adopting improved appliances of recognized value, and the losses
  being the damages incurred in case of accident.He treats the whole
  subject at great length and with much knowledge and ability.His
  report is a most valuable compendium for those who are in favor of a
  closer government supervision over railroads as a means of securing
  an increased safety from accident.To return, however, to the subject of railroad accidents, and the
final conclusion to be drawn from the statistics which have been
presented.That conclusion briefly stated is that the charges of
recklessness and indifference so generally and so widely advanced
against those managing the railroads cannot for an instant be
sustained.After all, as was said in the beginning of the present
volume, it is not the danger but the safety of the railroad which
should excite our special wonder.If any one doubts this, it is
very easy to satisfy himself of the fact,--that is, if by nature
he is gifted with the slightest spark of imagination.It is but
necessary to stand once on the platform of a way-station and to
look at an express train dashing by.There are few sights finer;
few better calculated to quicken the pulse.The glare of the head-light, the rush and throb of the
locomotive,--the connecting rod and driving-wheels of which seem
instinct with nervous life,--the flashing lamps in the cars, and
the final whirl of dust in which the red tail-lights vanish almost
as soon as they are seen,--all this is well calculated to excite
our admiration; but the special and unending cause for wonder is
how, in case of accident, anything whatever is left of the train.As it plunges into the darkness it would seem to be inevitable
that something must happen, and that, whatever happens, it must
necessarily involve both the train and every one in it in utter
and irremediable destruction.Here is a body weighing in the
neighborhood of two hundred tons, moving over the face of the earth
at a speed of sixty feet a second and held to its course only by two
slender lines of iron rails;--and yet it is safe!--We have seen how
when, half a century ago, the possibility of something remotely like
this was first discussed, a writer in the _British Quarterly_ earned
for himself a lasting fame by using the expression that "We should
as soon expect people to suffer themselves to be fired off upon
one of Congreve's _ricochet_ rockets, as to trust themselves to the
mercy of such a machine, going at such a rate;"--while Lord Brougham
exclaimed that "the folly of seven hundred people going fifteen
miles an hour, in six trains, exceeds belief."At the time they
wrote, the chances were ninety-nine in a hundred that both reviewer
and correspondent were right; and yet, because reality, not for the
first nor the last time, saw fit to outstrip the wildest flights of
imagination, the former at least blundered, by being prudent, into
an immortality of ridicule.The thing, however, is still none the
less a miracle because it is with us matter of daily observation.That, indeed, is the most miraculous part of it.At all hours of the
day and of the night, during every season of the year, this movement
is going on.It depends for its even action
on every conceivable contingency, from the disciplined vigilance
of thousands of employés to the condition of the atmosphere, the
heat of an axle, or the strength of a nail.The vast machine is in
constant motion, and the derangement of a single one of a myriad of
conditions may at any moment occasion one of those inequalities of
movement which are known as accidents.Yet at the end of the year,
of the hundreds of millions of passengers fewer have lost their
lives through these accidents than have been murdered in cold blood.Not without reason, therefore, has it been asserted that, viewing
at once the speed, the certainty, and the safety with which the
intricate movement of modern life is carried on, there is no more
creditable monument to human care, human skill, and human foresight
than the statistics of railroad accidents.Abergele, accident at, 72.Accidents, railroad, about stations, 166.

treats of "The Genesis of the Railroad System," "Accidents," and
the "Present Railroad Problem."The author has made himself the
acknowledged authority on this group of subjects.If his book goes
only to those who are interested in the ownership, the use, or the
administration of railroads, it is sure of a large circle of readers.--_Railway World._

"Characterized by broad, progressive, liberal ideas."--_Railway
Review._

"The entire conclusions are of great value."--_N.Y.I know where powder may be found
              Both by the keg and by the pound;
              Men use it in a tunnel near
              For blasting purposes, I hear.To get supplies all hands will go,
    And when we come we'll not be slow
    To teach the folks the proper way
    To honor Independence Day."Then from the muzzle broke the flame,
                And echo answered to the sound
                That startled folk for miles around.'Twas lucky for the Brownies' Band
                They were not of the mortal brand,
                Or half the crew would have been hurled
                In pieces to another world.For when at last the cannon roared,
                So huge the charge had Brownies poured,
    The metal of the gun rebelled
    And threw all ways the load it held.The pieces clipped the daisy-heads
    And tore the tree-tops into shreds.But Brownies are not slow to spy
    A danger, as are you and I.[Illustration:

                For they through strange and mystic art
                Observed it as it flew apart,
                And ducked and dodged and flattened out,
                To shun the fragments flung about.Some rogues were lifted from their feet
    And, turning somersaults complete,
    Like leaves went twirling through the air
    But only to receive a scare;
    And ere the smoke away had cleared
    In forest shade they disappeared.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES IN THE SWIMMING-SCHOOL.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    While Brownies passed along the street,
    Commenting on the summer's heat
    That wrapped the city day and night,
    A swimming-bath appeared in sight.Said one: "Of all the sights we've found,
    Since we commenced to ramble round,
    This seems to better suit the band
    Than anything, however grand.We'll rest awhile and find our way
    Inside the place without delay,
    And those who understand the art,
    Can knowledge to the rest impart;
        For every one should able be,
        To swim, in river, lake, or sea.We never know how soon we may,
        See some one sinking in dismay,--
        And then, to have the power to save
    A comrade from a watery grave,
    Will be a blessing sure to give
    Us joy the longest day we live."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The doors soon opened through the power
    That lay in Brownie hands that hour.When once within the fun began,
    As here and there they quickly ran;
    Some up the stairs made haste to go,
    Some into dressing-rooms below,
    In bathing-trunks to reappear
    And plunge into the water clear;
    Some from the spring-board leaping fair
    Would turn a somersault in air;
    More to the bottom like a stone,
    Would sink as soon as left alone,
    While others after trial brief
    Could float as buoyant as a leaf.[Illustration]

    Some all their time to others gave
    Assisting them to ride the wave,
    Explaining how to catch the trick,
    Both how to strike and how to kick;
    And still keep nose above the tide,
    That lungs with air might be supplied.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Thus diving in and climbing out,
    Or splashing round with laugh and shout,
    The happy band in water played
    As long as Night her scepter swayed.They heard the clocks in chapel towers
    Proclaim the swiftly passing hours.But when the sun looked from his bed
    To tint the eastern sky with red,
    In haste the frightened Brownies threw
    Their clothes about them and withdrew.[Illustration: TIME FLIES]




THE BROWNIES [Illustration] AND THE WHALE.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As Brownies chanced at eve to stray
    Around a wide but shallow bay,
    Not far from shore, to their surprise,
    They saw a whale of monstrous size,
      That, favored by the wind and tide,
      Had ventured in from ocean wide,
      But waves receding by-and-by,
      Soon left him with a scant supply.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            At times, with flaps and lunges strong
            He worked his way some yards along,
            Till on a bar or sandy marge
            He grounded like a leaden barge."A chance like this for all the band,"
            Cried one, "but seldom comes to hand.I know the bottom of this bay
            Like those who made the coast survey.'Tis level as a threshing-floor
            And shallow now from shore to shore;
            That creature's back will be as dry
    As hay beneath a                  tropic sky,
    Till morning tide                 comes full and free
    And gives him aid                 to reach the sea."another cried;
    "Let all make haste               to gain his side
            Then clamber up as best we may,
            And ride him round till break of day."At once, the band in great delight
                         Went splashing through the water bright,
                         And soon to where he rolled about
                         They lightly swam, or waded out.Now climbing up, the Brownies tried
            To take position for the ride.Some lying down a hold maintained;
            More, losing place as soon as gained,
            Were forced a dozen times to scale
            The broad side of the stranded whale.Now half-afloat and half-aground
            The burdened monster circled round,
    Still groping clumsily about
    As if to find the channel out,
    And Brownies clustered close, in fear
    That darker moments might be near.And soon the dullest in the band
    Was sharp enough to understand
    The creature was no longer beached,
    But deeper water now had reached.For plunging left, or plunging right,
    Or plowing downward in his might,
    The fact was plain, as plain could be--
    The whale was working out to sea![Illustration]

    A creeping fear will seize the mind
    As one is leaving shores behind,
    And knows the bark whereon he sails
    Is hardly fit to weather gales.Soon Fancy, with a graphic sweep,
    Portrays the nightmares of the deep;
    While they can see, with living eye,
    The terrors of the air sweep by.[Illustration]

        For who would not a fierce bird dread,
        If it came flying at his head?And these were hungry, squawking things,
        With open beaks and flapping wings.They made the Brownies dodge and dip,
        Into the sea they feared to slip.The birds they viewed with chattering teeth,
    Yet dreaded more the foes beneath.The lobster, with his ready claw;
    The fish with sword, the fish with saw;
    The hermit-crab, in coral hall,
    Averse to every social call;
    The father-lasher, and the shrimp,
    The cuttle-fish, or ocean imp,
    All these increase the landsman's fright,
    As shores are fading out of sight.Such fear soon gained complete command
    Of every Brownie in the band.They looked behind, where fair and green
    The grassy banks and woods were seen.They looked ahead, where white and cold
    The foaming waves of ocean rolled,
    And then, with woful faces drew
    Comparisons between the two.[Illustration]

    Some blamed themselves for action rash
    Against all reason still to dash
    In danger's way, and never think
    Until they stood on ruin's brink.While others threw the blame on those
    Who did the risky trip propose.But meantime deep and deeper still
    The whale was settling down until
    His back looked like an island small
    That scarce gave standing-room to all.But, when their chance seemed slight indeed
    To sport again o'er dewy mead,
    The spouting whale, with movement strong,
    Ran crashing through some timbers long
    That lumbermen had strongly tied
    In cribs and rafts, an acre wide.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    'Twas then, in such a trying hour,
    The Brownies showed their nerve and power.The diving whale gave little time
    For them to choose a stick to climb,--
    But grips were strong; no hold was lost,
    However high the logs were tossed;
    By happy chance the boom remained
    That to the nearest shore was chained,
    And o'er that bridge the Brownies made
    A safe retreat to forest shade.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' KITES.[Illustration]

    The sun had hardly taken flight
    Unto the deepest caves of night;
    Or fowls secured a place of rest
    Where Reynard's paw could not molest,
    When Brownies gathered to pursue
    Their plans regarding pleasures new.Said one: "In spite of hand or string,
        Now hats fly round like crows in spring,
        Exposing heads to gusts of air,
    That ill the slightest draught can bear;
    While, high above the tallest tower,
    At morning, noon, and evening hour,
    The youngsters' kites with streaming tails
    Are riding out the strongest gales.The doves in steeples hide away
        Or keep their houses through the day,
        Mistaking every kite that flies
        For bird of prey of wondrous size."[Illustration]

        "You're not alone," another cried,
        "In taking note.I, too, have spied
        The boys of late, in street and court,
        Or on the roofs, at this fine sport;
        But yesternight I chanced to see
        A kite entangled in a tree.The string was nowhere to be found;
        The tail about a bough was wound.Some birds had torn the paper out,
        To line their nests, in trees about,
        But there beside the wreck I staid,
        Until I learned how kites are made.On me you safely may depend,
        To show the way to cut and bend.So let us now, while winds are high,
        Our hands at once to work apply;
        And from the hill that lifts its crown
        So far above the neighboring town,
        We'll send our kites aloft in crowds,
        To lose themselves among the clouds."A smile on every face was spread,
        At thought of fun like this, ahead;
        And quickly all the plans were laid,
        And work for every Brownie made.Some to the kitchens ran in haste,
        To manufacture pots of paste.Some ran for tacks or shingle-nails,
        And some for rags to make the tails,
        While more with loads of paper came,
        Or whittled sticks to make the frame.The strings, that others gathered, soon
        Seemed long enough to reach the moon.But where such quantities they found,
        'Tis not so easy to expound;--
        Perhaps some twine-shop, standing nigh,
        Was raided for the large supply;
        Perhaps some youthful angler whines
        About his missing fishing-lines.But let them find                   things where they will,
    The Brownies must                   be furnished still;
    And those who can't                 such losses stand,
    Will have to charge                 it to the Band.With busy fingers,                  well applied,
    They clipped and                    pasted, bent and tied;
    With paint and                      brush some ran about
    From kite to kite,                  to fit them out.On some they paint                  a visage fair,
    While others would                  affright a bear,
        Nor was it long (as one might guess
        Who knows what skill their hands possess)
        Before the kites, with string and tail,
        Were all prepared to ride the gale;
        And oh, the climax of their glee
        Was reached when kites were floating free!So quick they mounted through the air
        That tangling strings played mischief there,
    And threatened to remove from land
    Some valued members of the band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The birds of night were horrified
    At finding kites on every side,
    And netted strings, that seemed to be
    Designed to limit action free.But Brownies stood or ran about,
    Now winding up, now letting out;
    Now giving kites more tail or wing,
    Now wishing for a longer string;
    Until they saw the hints of day
    Approaching through the morning gray.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' DANCING-SCHOOL.[Illustration]

    When flitting bats commenced to wheel
    Around the eaves to find their meal,
    And owls to hoot in forests wide,
    To call their owlets to their side,
    The Brownie Band, in full array,
    Through silent streets pursued their way.But as they neared a building high,
    Surprise was shown in every eye.They heard the strains of music sweet,
    And tripping of the dancers' feet;
    While o'er the tap of heel and toe,
    The twang of harp and scrape of bow,
    Arose the clear and ringing call
    Of those who had control of all.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The Brownies slackened their swift pace,
    Then gathered closely round the place,
            To study out some way to win
            A peep or two at those within.Said one: "In matters of this kind
            Opinions differ, you will find.And some might say, with sober thought,
            That children should not thus be taught
            To hop around on toe and heel
            So actively to fiddle's squeal,
                For fear 'twould turn their minds away
                From graver duties of the day."Another said: "The dancing art
                Doth ease to every move impart.It gives alike to city-bred
                And country-born a graceful tread,
            And helps them bear themselves along
            Without offense in greatest throng.The nimble step, the springing knee,
    And balanced body all agree.The feet, my friends, may glide with grace
    As well as trudge from place to place.And in the parlor or without
    They best can stand or walk about
    Who found in early life a chance
    To mingle in the sprightly dance."[Illustration]

    The Brownies need no ladders long,
    No hoists, nor elevators strong,
    To lift them to an upper flight,
    A window-sill, or transom light.The weather-vane upon the spire,
    That overlooks the town entire,
    Is not too high above the base
    If fancy leads them to the place.'Tis said the very fleecy clouds
    They can bestride in eager crowds,
    Around the world their way to find,
    And leave the lagging winds behind.Said one: "We've scaled the dizzy heights
    Of mountain-peaks on other nights,
    And crossed the stream from shore to shore
    Where but the string-piece stretched before;
    And cunning Brownies, never fear,
    Will find some way to enter here."[Illustration]

    When once the Brownies' plans were laid,
    No formal, tiresome speech was made.In mystic ways, to Brownies known,
    They clambered up the walls of stone.They clung to this and that, like briers,
    They climbed the smooth electric wires;
    Some members lending ready aid
    To those who weaker nerves displayed.And in five minutes at the most,
    By vine, by bracket, and by post,
    By every scroll, and carving bold,
    That toes could touch or fingers hold
    They made their way, and gained a chance
    To view, unnoticed, every dance.Said one: "How pleasant is the sight
    To see those children young and bright
    While skipping blithely to and fro,
    Now joined in pairs, now in a row,
    Or formed in circles, hand in hand,
    And lightly moving at command--

[Illustration]

        Like butterflies through balmy air
        When summer spreads attractions fair,
    And blends with every whispering breeze
    The drowsy hum of working bees."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Another said: "When this is o'er
    The Brownie Band will take the floor.We'll bide our time and not be slow
            To take possession when they go.Then up and down the spacious hall
              We'll imitate the steps of all.We'll show that not in Frenchmen's bones
              Lies all the grace that nature owns;
              That others at the waltz can shine
              As well as Germans from the Rhine;
            That we some capers can enjoy
            As well as natives of Savoy."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            While thus they talked, the moments flew,
            And soon the master's task was through.When children's cloaks were wrapped around,
    And heavier shoes their feet had found
    They hastened home; but while they slept
    The Brownies in that building crept
    To take their turn at lively reel,
            At graceful glide, or dizzy wheel,
            Till all the dances people know,
              From Cuba's palms to Russia's snow
              Were tried, and soon in every case
              Were mastered with surprising grace.Imagine how they skipped about,
              And how they danced, with laugh and shout![Illustration]

[Illustration]

    No sooner had the Brownies run
    Into the hall than 'twas begun.Some round the harp, with cunning stroke,
    The music in the strings awoke.The violins to others fell,
    Who scraped, and sawed, and fingered well,
    Until the sweet and stirring air
    Would rouse the feet of dullest there.Like people in the spring of life,
    Of joys and countless blessings rife,
    Who yield themselves to Pleasure's hand--
    So danced that night the Brownie Band.First one would take his place to show
    The special step for heel or toe,
    Just how to edge about with care,
    And help around the partner fair,
    Nor plant his feet upon a dress--
    To cause confusion and distress.Then more would play the master's part,
    And give some lessons in the art:

[Illustration]

        Would show the rest some figures new
        From Turkey, China, or Peru.Now smoothly glide, as if on wings,
    Then bob around, as if on springs,
    Until the sprightly steps would call
    Loud acclamations from them all.They danced in twos with skip and bound,
    They danced in circles, round and round;
    They danced in lines that coiled about
    As runs the serpent in and out,
    Some moving slow, some standing still--
    More cutting capers with a will.At length, by joining hand in hand,
    The set included all the band.A happier crowd was never seen
    On ball-room floor or village green.By turns they danced, by turns would go
    And try their skill at string and bow--
    They almost sawed the fiddle through,
    So fast the bow across it flew.And louder still the harp would ring,
    As nimbler fingers plucked the string.Alike they seemed a skillful band
    Upon the floor or music-stand.The night wore on, from hour to hour,
    And still they danced with vim and power;
    For supple-kneed and light of toe
    The Brownies are, as well you know,
    And such a thing as tiring out
    Gives them but small concern, no doubt.As long as darkness hung her pall
    In heavy folds around the hall,
    The Brownies stayed to dance and play,
    Until the very break of day.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    To dance the figures o'er and o'er,
    They lingered on the polished floor;
    No sooner was one party done
    Than others the position won.They chose their partners for the set,
    And bowed, and scraped, and smiling, met.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As night advanced, and morning gray
    Nigh and still nigher cast its ray,
    The lively Brownies faster flew,
    Across and back, around and through;
    Now down the center, up the side,
    Then back to place with graceful glide--
                  Until it seemed that even day
                  Would hardly drive the band away.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                  At length some, more upon their guard
                  Against surprises, labored hard
    To urge their comrades from the place
    Before the sun would show his face.They pulled and hauled with all their might
    At those half crazy with delight,
                  Who still would struggle for a chance
                  To have, at least, another dance--
                  Some figure that was quite forgot,
                          Although "the finest of the lot."Another wished to linger still--
                          In spite of warning words--until
                          Each member present on the floor
                          Had been his partner twice or more.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Meantime, outside, the tell-tale dyes
                Of morn began to paint the skies,
                And, one by one, the stars of night
                Grew pale before the morning's light.Alone, bright Venus, in the west,
                Upheld her torch and warned the rest;
                While from the hedge the piping note
                Of waking birds began to float;
    And crows upon the wooded hills
    Commenced to stir and whet their bills,
    When Brownies scampered from the place,
    And undertook the homeward race.Nor made a halt in street or square,
    Or verdant park, however fair;
    But farther from the sight of man
    And light of day, they quickly ran.They traveled at their highest speed,
    And swiftly must they go, indeed;
    For, like the spokes of some great wheel,
    The rays of light began to steal
    Still higher up the eastern sky,
    And showed the sun was rolling nigh.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' CANDY-PULL.[Illustration]

    One evening, while the Brownies sat
    Enjoying free and friendly chat,
    Some on the trees, some on the ground,
    And others perched on fences round--
    One Brownie, rising in his place,
    Addressed the band with beaming face.The listeners gathered with delight
    Around the member, bold and bright,
    To hear him tell of scenes he'd spied
    While roaming through the country wide."Last eve," said he, "to shun the blast,
    Behind a cottage fence I passed.While there, I heard a merry rout,
    And as the yard was dark without,
    I crawled along through weeds and grass,
    Through melon-vines and broken glass,
    Until I might, unnoticed, win
    A glimpse of all the sport within.At length, below the window-pane,
                    To reach the sill I stretched in vain;
                    But, thanks to my inquiring mind
                    And sundry bricks, I chanced to find
    The facts I can relate in full
    About that lively candy-pull.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    "An hour or more, I well believe,
    I stood, their actions to perceive,
    With elbows resting on the sill,
    And nose against the window still.I watched them closely at their fun,
    And learned how everything was done.The younger members took the lead,
    And carried on the work with speed.With nimble feet they ran about
    From place to place, with laugh and shout;
    But older heads looked on the while,
    And cheered the youngsters with a smile,
    And gave advice in manner kind
    To guide the inexperienced mind.They placed the sugar in a pot,
    And stirred it round till boiling hot;
    Then rolled and worked it in their hands,
    And stretched it out in shining bands,
    Until it reached across the floor,
    From mantel-piece to kitchen door."These eyes of mine for many a night
    Have not beheld a finer sight.To pull the candy was the part
    Of some who seemed to know the art.The moon had slipped behind the hill,
    And hoarse had grown the whip-poor-will;
    But still, with nose against the pane,
    I kept my place through wind and rain.There, perched upon the shaky pile,
    With bated breath I gazed the while.I watched them with the sharpest sight
    That I might tell the tale aright;
    For all the active youngsters there
    Appeared to have of work their share.Some put fresh sugar in the pot,
    Some kept the fire blazing hot,
    And worked away as best they could
    To keep the stove well filled with wood.Indeed, ourselves, with all our skill,
    At moving here and there at will,
    Would have to 'lively' be and 'tear
    Around' to beat those children there!Some cut it up, more passed it round,
    While others ate it by the pound!"[Illustration]

    At this, a murmur of surprise
    On every side began to rise;
    Then smiles o'er every visage flitted,
    As wide as cheeks and ears permitted,
    That told what train of thought had sped
    At once through every Brownie's head--
    A thought of pleasure near at hand
    That well would suit the cunning band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            The Brownies act without delay
            When new ideas cross their way,
            And soon one raised a finger small
            And close attention gained from all.They crowded near with anxious glance
            To learn what scheme he could advance--
    What methods mention or employ
    To bring about the promised joy.Said he: "A vacant house is near.The owner leaves it every year
    For several months, and pleasure seeks
    On ocean waves or mountain peaks.The range is there against the wall,
            The pots, the pans, the spoons, and all,
            While cans of syrup may be found
            In every grocer's store around.The Brownie must be dull and tame,
            And scarce deserves to bear the name,
            Who will not join with heart and hand
            To carry out a scheme so grand."[Illustration]

    Another cried: "When to his bed
    The sun to-morrow stoops his head,
    Again we'll muster in full force
    And to that building turn our course."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            Next eve they gained the street at last
            That through the silent city passed;
            And soon they paused, their eyes they raised
            And on the vacant mansion gazed.In vain the miser hides his store,
    In vain the merchant bars his door,
    In vain the locksmith changes keys--
    The Brownies enter where they please.Through iron doors, through gates of brass,
    And walls of stone they safely pass,
    And smile to think how soon they can
    Upset the studied schemes of man.Within that house, without delay,
    Behind the guide they worked their way,
    More happy far and full of glee
    Than was the owner, out at sea.The whale, the shark, or fish that flies
    Had less attraction for his eyes
    Than had the shining candy-balls
    For Brownies, swarming through his halls.Soon coal was from the cellar brought
    And kindling wood came, quick as thought;
    Then pots and pans came rattling in
    And syrup sweet, in cans of tin.Just where the syrup had been found
    It matters not.The cunning band was soon possessed
    Of full supplies and of the best;
    Next tablespoons of silver fine
    In every hand appeared to shine,
    And ladles long, of costly ware,
    That had been laid away with care.No sooner was the syrup hot
    Than some around the kettle got,
    And dabbed away in eager haste
    To be the first to get a taste.Then some were scalded when the spoon
    Let fall its contents all too soon,
            And gave the tongue too warm a mess
            To carry without some distress.Then steps were into service brought
            That dancing-masters never taught,
            And smothered cries and swinging hand
            Would wake the wonder of the band.And when the candy boiled until
            It could be pulled and hauled at will,
    Take every shape or twist, and seem
    As free as fancy in a dream,
    The busy, happy-hearted crew
    Enjoyed the moments as they flew.The Brownies in the building stayed
    And candy ate as fast as made.But when at length the brightening sky
    Gave warning they must homeward fly,
    They quickly sought the open air
    And had but little time to spare.The shortest way, as often found,
    Was o'er the roughest piece of ground,
    Where rocks as large as houses lay
    All scattered round in wild array.Some covered o'er with clinging vines,
    Some bearing up gigantic pines,
    Or spreading oaks, that rooted fast,
    For centuries had stood the blast.But over all the rugged ground
    The Brownies passed with lightsome bound,
    Now jumping clear from block to block,
    Now sliding down the shelving rock,
    Or cheering on the lagging kind
    Who here and there would fall behind.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AND THE LOCOMOTIVE.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                One night the Brownies found their way
                To where some tracks and switches lay,
                And buildings stood, such as are found
    In every town on railroad ground.They moved about from place to place,
    With prying eyes and cautious pace
    They peeped in shops and gained a view,
    Where cars were standing bright and new;
    While others, that had service known,
    And in some crash were overthrown,
    On jack-screws, blocks, and such affairs,
    Were undergoing full repairs.The table that turns end for end
            Its heavy load, without a bend,
            Was next inspected through and through
            And tested by the wondering crew.They scanned the signal-lights with care
            That told the state of switches there,--
            Showed whether tracks kept straight ahead,
            Or simply to some siding led.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Then round a locomotive strong
                They gathered in an earnest throng,
                Commenting on the style it showed,
                Its strength and speed upon the road.Said one: "That 'pilot' placed before
                Will toss a cow a block or more;
            You'd hardly find a bone intact
            When such a thing her frame has racked--
            Above the fence, and, if you please,
            Above the smoke-stack and the trees
            Will go the horns and heels in air,
            When hoisted by that same affair.""Sometimes it saves," another cried,
            "And throws an object far aside
            That would to powder have been ground,
            If rushing wheels a chance had found.I saw a goat tossed from the track
            And landed on a farmer's stack,
            And though surprised at fate so strange,
            He seemed delighted at the change;
            And lived content, on best of fare,
            Until the farmer found him there."Another said: "We'll have some fun
    And down the road this engine run.The steam is up, as gauges show;
    She's puffing, ready now to go;
    The fireman and the engineer
    Are at their supper, in the rear
    Of yonder shed.I took a peep,
    And found the watchman fast asleep.So now's our time, if we but haste,
    The joys of railway life to taste.I know the engine-driver's art,
    Just how to stop, reverse, and start;
    I've watched them when they little knew
    From every move I knowledge drew;
    We'll not be seen till under way,
    And then, my friends, here let me say,
    The man or beast will something lack
    Who strives to stop us on the track."Then some upon the engine stepped,
    And some upon the pilot crept,
    And more upon the tender found
    A place to sit and look around.And soon away the engine rolled
    At speed 'twas fearful to behold;
    It seemed they ran, where tracks were straight,
    At least at mile-a-minute rate;
    And even where the curves were short
    The engine turned them with a snort
    That made the Brownies' hearts the while
    Rise in their throats, for half a mile.But travelers many dangers run
    On safest roads beneath the sun.They ran through yards, where dogs came out
    To choke with dust that whirled about,
    And so could neither growl nor bark
    Till they had vanished in the dark;
    Some pigs that wandered late at night,
    And neither turned to left nor right,
        But on the crossing held debate
        Who first should squeeze beneath the gate,
        Were helped above the fence to rise
        Ere they had time to squeal surprise,
        And never after cared to stray
        Along the track by night or day.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        But when a town was just in sight,
        And speed was at its greatest height,--
        Alas!that such a thing should be,--
        An open switch the Brownies see.Then some thought best at once to go
                        Into the weeds and ditch below;
                        But many on the engine stayed
                        And held their grip, though much dismayed.And waited for the shock to fall
                        That would decide the fate of all.In vain reversing tricks were tried,
                        And brakes to every wheel applied;
                        The locomotive forward flew,
                        In spite of all that skill could do.But just as they approached the place
                Where trouble met them face to face,
    Through some arrangement, as it seemed,
    Of which the Brownies never dreamed,
    The automatic switch was closed,
    A safety signal-light exposed,
    And they were free to roll ahead,
    And wait for those who'd leaped in dread;
    Although the end seemed near at hand
    Of every Brownie in the band,
    And darkest heads through horrid fright
    Were in a moment changed to white,
    The injuries indeed were small.A few had suffered from their fall,
    And some were sprained about the toes,
    While more were scraped upon the nose;
    But all were able to succeed
    In climbing to a place with speed,
    And there they stayed until once more
    They passed the heavy round-house door.Then jumping down on every side
    The Brownies scampered off to hide;
    And as they crossed the trestle high
    The sun was creeping up the sky,
    And urged them onward in their race
    To find some safe abiding place.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' FANCY BALL.[Illustration]

    It was the season of the year
    When people, dressed in fancy gear,
    From every quarter hurried down
    And filled the largest halls in town;
    And there to flute and fiddle sweet
    Went through their sets with lively feet.The Brownies were not slow to note
    That fun indeed was now afloat;
    And ere the season passed away,
    Of longest night and shortest day,
    They looked about to find a hall
    Where they could hold their fancy ball.Said one: "A room can soon be found
    Where all the band can troop around;
    But want of costumes, much I fear,
    Will bar our pleasure all the year."My eyes have not been shut of late,--
    Don't show a weak and hopeless mind
    Because your knowledge is confined,--

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For I'm prepared to take the band
    To costumes, ready to the hand,
    Of every pattern, new or old:
    The kingly robes, with chains of gold,
    The cloak and plume of belted knight,
    The pilgrim's hat and stockings white,
    The dresses for the ladies fair,
    The gems and artificial hair,
    The soldier-suits in blue and red,
    The turban for the Tartar's head,
    All can be found where I will lead,
    If friends are willing to proceed."[Illustration]

    Those knowing best the Brownie way
    Will know there was no long delay,
    Ere to the town he made a break
    With all the Brownies in his wake.It mattered not that roads were long,
    That hills were high or winds were strong;
    Soon robes were found on peg and shelf,
    And each one chose to suit himself.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The costumes, though a world too wide,
    And long enough a pair to hide,
    Were gathered in with skill and care,
    That showed the tailor's art was there.Then out they started for the hall,
    In fancy trappings one and all;
    Some clad like monks in sable gowns;
    And some like kings; and more like clowns;
    And Highlanders, with naked knees;
    And Turks, with turbans like a cheese;
    While many members in the line
    Were dressed like ladies fair and fine,
    And swept along the polished floor
    A train that reached a yard or more.[Illustration]

    By happy chance some laid their hand
    Upon the outfit of a band;
    The horns and trumpets took the lead,
    Supported well by string and reed;
    And violins, that would have made
    A mansion for the rogues that played,
    With flute and clarionet combined
    In music of the gayest kind.In dances wild and strange to see
    They passed the hours in greatest glee;
    Familiar figures all were lost
    In flowing robes that round them tossed;
    And well-known faces hid behind
    Queer masks that quite confused the mind.The queen and clown, a loving pair,
    Enjoyed a light fandango there;
    While solemn monks of gentle heart,
    In jig and scalp-dance took their part.The grand salute, with courteous words,
                The bobbing up and down, like birds,
                The lively skip, the stately glide,
                The double turn, and twist aside
                Were introduced in proper place
                And carried through with ease and grace.So great the pleasure proved to all,
    Too long they tarried in the hall,
    And morning caught them on the fly,
    Ere they could put the garments by!Then dodging out in great dismay,
            By walls and stumps they made their way;
            And not until the evening's shade
            Were costumes in their places laid.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AND THE TUGBOAT.[Illustration]

    While Brownies strayed along a pier
    To view the shipping lying near,
    A tugboat drew their gaze at last;
    'Twas at a neighboring wharf made fast.Cried one: "See what in black and red
    Below the pilot-house is spread!In honor of the Brownie Band,
    It bears our name in letters grand.Through all the day she's on the go;
    Now with a laden scow in tow,
    And next with barges two or three,
    Then taking out a ship to sea,
    Or through the Narrows steaming round
    In search of vessels homeward bound;
    She's stanch and true from stack to keel,
    And we should highly honored feel."Another said: "An hour ago,
    The men went up to see a show,
    And left the tugboat lying here.The steam is up, our course is clear,
    We'll crowd on board without delay
    And run her up and down the bay.We have indeed a special claim,
    Because she bears the 'Brownie' name.Before the dawn creeps through the east
    We'll know about her speed at least,
    And prove how such a craft behaves
    When cutting through the roughest waves.Behind the wheel I'll take my stand
    And steer her round with skillful hand,
    Now down the river, now around
    The bay, or up the broader sound;
    Throughout the trip I'll keep her clear
    Of all that might awaken fear.When hard-a-port the helm I bring,
    Or starboard make a sudden swing,
    The Band can rest as free from dread
    As if they slept on mossy bed.I something know about the seas,
    I've boxed a compass, if you please,
    And so can steer her east or west,
    Or north or south, as suits me best.Without the aid of twinkling stars
    Or light-house lamps, I'll cross the bars.I know when north winds nip the nose,
    Or sou'-sou'-west the 'pig-wind' blows,
    As hardy sailors call the gale
    That from that quarter strikes the sail."A third replied: "No doubt you're smart
    And understand the pilot's art,
    But more than one a hand should take,
    For all our lives will be at stake.In spite of eyes and ears and hands,
    And all the skill a crew commands,
    How oft collisions crush the keel
    And give the fish a sumptuous meal!Too many rocks around the bay
    Stick up their heads to bar the way.Too many vessels, long and wide,
    At anchor in the channel ride
    For us to show ourselves unwise
    And trust to but one pair of eyes."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long the tugboat swinging clear
    Turned bow to stream and left the pier,
    While many Brownies, young and old,
    From upper deck to lower hold
    Were crowding round in happy vein
    Still striving better views to gain.Some watched the waves around them roll;
    Some stayed below to shovel coal,
    From hand to hand, with pitches strong,
    They passed the rattling loads along.Some at the engine took a place,
    More to the pilot-house would race
    To keep a sharp lookout ahead,
    Or man the wheel as fancy led.But accidents we oft record,
    However well we watch and ward,
    And vessels often go to wreck
    With careful captains on the deck;
    They had mishaps that night, for still,
    In spite of all their care and skill,
    While running straight or turning round
    In river, bay, or broader sound,
    At times they ran upon a rock,
    And startled by the sudden shock
    Some timid Brownies, turning pale,
    Would spring at once across the rail;
    And then, repenting, find all hope
    Of life depended on a rope,
    That willing hands were quick to throw
    And hoist them from the waves below.Sometimes too near a ship they ran
    For peace of mind; again, their plan
    Would come to naught through lengthy tow
    Of barges passing to and fro.The painted buoys around the bay
    At times occasioned some dismay--
    They took them for torpedoes dread
    That might the boat in fragments spread,
    Awake the city's slumbering crowds,
    And hoist the band among the clouds.But thus, till hints of dawn appeared
    Now here, now there, the boat was steered
    With many joys and many fears,
    That some will bear in mind for years;
    But at her pier once more she lay
    When night gave place to creeping day.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' TALLY-HO.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As shades of evening closed around,
        The Brownies, from some wooded ground,
        Looked out to view with staring eye
        A Tally-Ho, then passing by.Around the park they saw it roll,
    Now sweeping round a wooded knoll,
    Now rumbling o'er an arching bridge,
    Now hid behind a rocky ridge,
    Now wheeling out again in view
    To whirl along some avenue.They hardly could restrain a shout
    When they observed the grand turnout.The long, brass horn, that trilled so loud,
    The prancing horses, and the crowd
                    Of people perched so high in air
                    Pleased every wondering Brownie there.Said one: "A rig like this we see
    Would suit the Brownies to a T!And I'm the one, here let me say,
    To put such pleasures in our way:
    I know the very place to go
    To-night to find a Tally-Ho.It never yet has borne a load
                    Of happy hearts along the road;
                    But, bright and new in every part
                    'Tis ready for an early start.The horses in the stable stand
                    With harness ready for the hand;
                    If all agree, we'll take a ride
                    For miles across the country wide."Another said: "The plan is fine;
                    You well deserve to head the line;
                    But, on the road, the reins I'll draw;
    I know the way to 'gee' and 'haw,'
    And how to turn a corner round,
    And still keep wheels upon the ground."Another answered: "No, my friend,
    We'll not on one alone depend;
    But three or four the reins will hold,
                    That horses may be well controlled.The curves are short, the hills are steep,
                    The horses fast, and ditches deep,
                    And at some places half the band
                    May have to take the lines in hand."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    That night, according to their plan,
    The Brownies to the stable ran;
    Through swamps they cut to reach the place,
    And cleared the fences in their race
      As lightly as the swallow flies
        To catch its morning meal supplies.Though, in the race, some clothes were soiled,
            And stylish shoes completely spoiled,
    Across the roughest hill or rock
    They scampered like a frightened flock,
    Now o'er inclosures knee and knee,
    With equal speed they clambered free
    And soon with faces all aglow
    They crowded round the Tally-Ho;
    But little time they stood to stare
    Or smile upon the strange affair.As many hands make labor light,
    And active fingers win the fight,
    Each busy Brownie played his part,
    And soon 't was ready for the start.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    But ere they took their seats to ride
    By more than one the horns were tried,
    Each striving with tremendous strain
    The most enlivening sound to gain,
    And prove he had a special right
    To blow the horn throughout the night.[Illustration]

    Though some were crowded in a seat,
    And some were forced to keep their feet
    Or sit upon another's lap,
    And some were hanging to a strap,
    With merry laugh and ringing shout,
    And tooting horns, they drove about.A dozen miles, perhaps, or more,
    The lively band had traveled o'er,
    Commenting on their happy lot
    And keeping horses on the trot,
    When, as they passed a stunted oak
    A wheel was caught, the axle broke![Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some went out with sudden pitch,
    And some were tumbled in the ditch,
    And one jumped off to save his neck,
    While others still hung to the wreck.Confusion reigned, for coats were rent,
    And hats were crushed, and horns were bent,
    And what began with fun and clatter
    Had turned to quite a serious matter.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                        Some blamed the drivers, others thought
                        The tooting horns the trouble brought.More said, that they small wisdom showed,
                        Who left the root so near the road.But while they talked about their plight
                        Upon them burst the morning light
                        With all the grandeur and the sheen
                          That June could lavish on the scene.So hitching horses where they could,
                                  The Brownies scampered for the wood.And lucky were the Brownies spry:
                                  A dark and deep ravine was nigh
                                  That seemed to swallow them alive
    So quick were they to jump and dive,
    To safely hide from blazing day
    That fast had driven night away,
    And forced them to leave all repairs
    To other heads and hands than theirs.THE BROWNIES ON

[Illustration]

THE RACE-TRACK.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    While Brownies moved around one night
                    A seaside race-track came in sight."'T is here," said one, "the finest breed
                    Of horses often show their speed;
                    Here, neck and neck, and nose and nose,
                    Beneath the jockeys' urging blows,
                    They sweep around the level mile
                    The people shouting all the while;
    And climbing up or crowding through
    To gain a better point of view,
    So they can see beyond a doubt
    How favorites are holding out."Another said: "I know the place
    Where horses wait to-morrow's race;
    We'll strap the saddles on their back,
    And lead them out upon the track.Then some will act the jockey's part,
    And some, as judges, watch the start,
    And drop the crimson flag to show
    The start is fair and all must go."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long, the Brownies turned to haul
    Each wondering race-horse from his stall.They bridled them without delay,
        And saddles strapped in proper way.Some restless horses rearing there
        Would toss their holders high in air,
        And test the courage and the art
        Of those who took an active part.Said one: "I've lurked in yonder wood,
          And watched the races when I could.I know how all is done with care
              When thus for racing they prepare;
                How every buckle must be tight,
                And every strap and stirrup right,
    Or jockeys would be on the ground
    Before they circled half way round."When all was ready for the show
    Each Brownie rogue was nowise slow
    At climbing up to take a place
    And be a jockey in the race.Full half a dozen Brownies tried
    Upon one saddle now to ride;
    But some were into service pressed
    As judges to control the rest--
    To see that rules were kept complete,
    And then decide who won the heat.A dozen times they tried to start;
    Some shot ahead like jockeys smart,
    And were prepared to take the lead
    Around the track at flying speed.But others were so far behind,
    On horses of unruly mind,
    The judges from the stand declare
    The start was anything but fair.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        So back they'd jog at his command,
        In better shape to pass the stand.Indeed it was no simple trick
        To ride those horses, shy and quick,
        And only for the mystic art
        That is the Brownies' special part,
    A dozen backs, at least, had found
    A resting-place upon the ground.The rules of racing were not quite
    Observed in full upon that night.Around and round the track they flew,
    In spite of all the judge could do.The race, he tried to let them know,
    Had been decided long ago.But still the horses kept the track,
    With Brownies clinging to each back.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            Some racers of the jumping kind
            At times disturbed the riders' mind
            When from the track they sudden wheeled,
            And over fences took the field,
            As if they hoped in some such mode
            To rid themselves of half their load.But horses, howsoever smart,
        Are not a match for Brownie art,
    For still the riders stuck through all,
    In spite of fence, or ditch, or wall.Some clung to saddle, some to mane,
    While others tugged at bridle rein.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    So all the steeds found it would pay
    To let the Brownies have their way,
    Until a glimpse of rising sun
    Soon made them leave the place and run.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' BIRTHDAY DINNER.[Illustration]

    When people through the county planned
    To give their public dinners grand,
    The Brownies met at day's decline
    To have a birthday banquet fine."The proper things," a speaker cried,
    "Await us here on every side;
    We simply have to reach and take
    And choose a place to boil and bake.With meal and flour at our feet,
    And wells of water pure and sweet,
    That Brownie must be dull indeed
    Who lacks the gumption to proceed.We'll peel the pumpkins, ripened well,
    And scoop them hollow, like a shell,
    Then slice them up the proper size
    To make at length those famous pies,
    For which the people, small and great,
    Are ever quick to reach a plate."[Illustration]

    This pleased them all; so none were slow
    In finding work at which to go.A stove that chance threw in their way
    Was put in shape without delay.Though doors were cracked, and legs were rare,
                    The spacious oven still was there,
                    Where pies and cakes and puddings wide
                    Might bake together side by side.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

              The level top, though incomplete,
              Gave pots and pans a welcome seat,
              Where stews could steam and dumplings found
              A fitting place to roll around.Some lengths of pipe were raised on high
    That made the soot and cinders fly,
    And caused a draught throughout the wreck
    That door or damper failed to check.The rogues who undertook the part,
              That tries the cook's delightful art,
              Had smarting hands and faces red
              Before the table-cloth was spread;
                      But what cared they at such an hour
                      For singeing flame or scalding shower?Such ills are always reckoned slight
                      When great successes are in sight.There cakes and tarts and cookies fine,
                      Of both the "leaf" and "notched" design,
                      Were ranged in rows around the pan
                    That into heated ovens ran;
                    Where, in what seemed a minute's space,
                    Another batch would take their place;
                    While birds, that had secured repose
                    Above the reach of Reynard's nose,
                    Without the aid of wings came down
                    To be at midnight roasted brown.They found some boards and benches laid
                    Aside by workmen at their trade,
                    And these upon the green were placed
                    By willing hands with proper haste.Said one, who board and bench combined:
                    "All art is not to cooks confined,
                    And some expertness we can show
                    As well as those who mix the dough."And all was as the speaker said;
                In fact, they were some points ahead;
              For when the cooks their triumphs showed,
            The table waited for its load.The knives and forks and dishes white
        By secret methods came to light.Much space would be required to tell
    Just how the table looked so well;
    But kitchen cupboards, three or four,
    Must there have yielded up their store;
    For all the guests on every side
    With full equipments were supplied.When people find a carver hacked,
    A saucer chipped, or platter cracked,
    They should be somewhat slow to claim
    That servants are the ones to blame;
        For Brownies may have used the ware
      And failed to show the proper care.[Illustration]

     A few, as waiters, passed about
    New dishes when the old gave out,
     And saw the plates, as soon as bare,
      Were heaped again with something rare.No member, as you may believe,
        Was anxious such a place to leave,
                Until he had a taste at least
                Of all the dishes in the feast.The Brownies, when they break their fast,
                Will eat as long as viands last,
                And even birds can not depend
                On crumbs or pickings at the end:
                The plates were scraped, the kettles clean,
                And not a morsel to be seen,
                Ere Brownies from that table ran
                To shun the prying eyes of man.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' HALLOW-EVE.[Illustration]

    On Hallow-eve, that night of fun,
     When elves and goblins frisk and run,
       And many games and tricks are tried
         At every pleasant fireside,
        The Brownies halted to survey
       A village that below them lay,
      And wondered as they rested there
    To hear the laughter fill the air
    That from the happy children came
    As they enjoyed some pleasant game.Said one: "What means this merry flow
    That comes so loudly from below,
    Uncommon pleasures must abound
    Where so much laughter can be found."Another said: "Now, by your leave,
    I'll tell you 't is All-Hallow-eve,
    When people meet to have their sport
    At curious games of every sort;
    I know them all from first to last,
    And now, before the night has passed,
    For some convenient place we'll start
    Without delay to play our part."Two dozen mouths commenced to show
    Their teeth in white and even row;
    Two dozen voices cried with speed,
    "The plan is good we're all agreed."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    And in a trice four dozen feet
    Went down the hill with even beat.Without a long or wearying race
    The Brownies soon secured a place
    That answered well in every way
    For all the games they wished to play.There tubs of water could be found,
    By which to stoop or kneel around,
    And strive to bring the pennies out
    That on the bottom slipped about.Then heads were wet and shoulders, too,
    Where some would still the coin pursue,
    And mouth about now here and there
    Without a pause or breath of air
    Until in pride, with joyful cries,
    They held aloft the captured prize.More stood the tempting bait beneath,
    And with a hasty snap of teeth
    The whirling apple thought to claim
    And shun the while the candle's flame,--
    But found that with such pleasure goes
    An eye-brow singed, or blistered nose.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    More named the oats as people do
    To try which hearts are false, which true,
    And on the griddle placed the pair
    To let them part or smoulder there;
    And smiled to see, through woe or weal,
    How often hearts were true as steel.Still others tried to read their fate
    Or fortune in a dish or plate,
    Learn whether they would ever wed,
    Or lead a single life instead;
    Or if their mate would be a blessing,
    Or prove a partner most distressing.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then others in the open air,
    Of fun and frolic had their share;
    Played "hide and seek," and "blindman's buff,"
    And "tag" o'er places smooth or rough,
    And "snap the whip" and "trip the toe,"
    And games that none but Brownies know.As if their lives at stake were placed,
    They jumped around and dodged and raced,
    And tumbled headlong to the ground
    When feet some hard obstruction found;
    At times across the level mead,
    Some proved their special claims to speed,
    And as reward of merit wore
    A wreath of green till sport was o'er.The hours flew past as hours will
    When joys do every moment fill;
    The moon grew weak and said good-night,
    And turned her pallid face from sight;
    Then weakening stars began to fail,
    But still the Brownies kept the vale;
    Full many a time had hours retired
    Much faster than the band desired,
    And pleasure seemed too sweet to lay
    Aside, because of coming day,
      But never yet with greater pain
        Did they behold the crimson stain
          That morning spread along the sky,
            And told them they must homeward fly




THE BROWNIES' [Illustration] FLAG-POLE.[Illustration]

    The Brownies through a village bound,
    Paused in their run to look around,
    And wondered why the central square
    Revealed no flag-pole tall and fair.Said one: "Without delay we'll go
    To woods that stand some miles below.The tall spruce lifts its tapering crest
    So straight and high above the rest,
    We soon can choose a flag-pole there
    To ornament this village square.Then every one a hand will lend
    To trim it off from end to end,
    To peel it smooth and paint it white,
    And hoist it in the square to-night."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then to the woods the Brownies ran
    At once to carry out their plan;
    While some ran here and there with speed
    For implements to serve their need,
    Some rambled through the forest free
    To find the proper kind of tree,
    Then climbed the tree while yet it stood
    To learn if it was sound and good,
                                   Without a flaw, a twist, or bend,
                                   To mar its looks from end to end.When one was found that suited well,
                                   To work the active Brownies fell;
      And soon with sticks beneath their load,
      The band in grand procession strode;
        It gave them quite enough to do
        To safely put the project through,
        But when they reached the square, at last,
        Some ropes around the pole were passed
        And from the tops of maples tall
        A crowd began to pull and haul,
        While others gathered at the base
        Until the flag-pole stood in place.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For Brownies seldom idle stand
    When there is fun or work on hand.At night when darkness wraps us round
    They come from secret haunts profound,
    With brushes, pots of paint, and all,
    They clamber over fence and wall;
    And soon on objects here and there
    That hold positions high in air,
    And most attract the human eye,
    The marks of Brownie fingers lie.Sometimes with feet that never tire
    They climb the tall cathedral spire;
    When all the town is still below,
    Save watchmen pacing to and fro,
    By light of moon, and stars alone,
    They dust the marble and the stone,
          And with their brushes, small and great,
          They paint and gild the dial-plate;
          And bring the figures plain in sight
          That all may note Time's rapid flight.And accidents they often know
          While through the heavy works they go,
          Where slowly turning wheels at last
          In bad position hold them fast.But Brownies, notwithstanding all
          The hardships that may them befall,
          Still persevere in every case
          Till morning drives them from the place.And then with happy hearts they fly
          To hide away from human eye.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES ON THE CANAL.[Illustration]

    One night the Brownies stood beside
    A long canal, whose silent tide
    Connected seaboard cities great
    With inland sections of the state.The laden boats, so large and strong,
    Were tied to trees by hawsers long;
    No boatmen stood by helm or oar,
    No mules were tugging on the shore;
    All work on land and water too
    Had been abandoned by the crew.Said one: "We see, without a doubt,
    What some dispute has brought about.Perhaps a strike for greater pay,
    For even rates, or shorter day,
    Has caused the boats to loiter here
    With cargoes costing some one dear.These cabbages so large and round
    Should, long ere this, the dish have found,
    Upon some kitchen-stove or range
    To spread an odor rich and strange;
    Those squashes, too, should not be lost
    By long exposure to the frost,
    When they would prove so great a prize
    To old and young, if baked in pies.And then those pippins, ripe and fair,
    From some fine orchard picked with care,
                    Should not to rot and ruin go,
                    Though work is hard or wages low,
                    When thousands would be glad to stew
                    The smallest apples there in view."[Illustration]

    Another said: "We lack the might
    To set the wrongs of labor right,
    But by the power within us placed
    We'll see that nothing goes to waste.So every hand must be applied
    That boats upon their way may glide."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some ran here and there with speed
    To find a team to suit their need.A pair of mules, that grazed about
    The grassy banks, were fitted out
                With straps and ropes without delay
                To start the boats upon their way;
                And next some straying goats were found,
                Where in a yard they nibbled round
                Destroying plants of rarest kind
                That owners in the town could find.Soon, taken from their rich repast,
    They found themselves in harness fast;
    Then into active service pressed
    They trod the tow-path with the rest.[Illustration]

    On deck some Brownies took their stand
    To man the helm, or give command,
    And oversee the work; while more
    Stayed with the teams upon the shore.At times the rope would drag along
            And catch on snags or branches long,
                    And cause delays they ill could bear,
                    For little time they had to spare.[Illustration]

            With accidents they often met,
            And some were bruised and more were wet;
            Some tumbled headlong down the hold;
            And some from heaping cargoes rolled.But what care Brownies for a bruise,
            Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,
            When enterprises bold and new
    Must ere the dawn be carried through?If half the band were drenched, no doubt
    The work would still be carried out,
    For extra strength would then be found
    In those who still were safe and sound.was the shout
    They stood and stared or ran about
    Till in the water, heels o'er head,
    Some members of the band were spread.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    A few could swim, and held their own;
    But more went downward like a stone
    Until, without the plummet's aid,
            They learned how deep canals are made.In spite of all the kicks and flings
            That fright at such a moment brings,
    Through lack of art, or weight of fear,
    It looked as if their end was near.The order now to stop the team
    Would pass along with sign and scream,
    And those on land would know by this
    That something startling was amiss;
    And those on board could plainly see
    Unless assistance there could be,
    In shape of ropes and fingers strong,
    There'd be some vacancies, ere long![Illustration]

    By chance a net was to be had,
    That boatmen used for catching shad--
    A gill-net of the strongest kind,
    For heavy catches well designed;
    Few shad against its meshes ran
    But left their bones on some one's pan,
    This bulky thing the active crew
    Far overboard with promptness threw.A hold at once some Brownies found,
    While others in its folds were bound,
    Until like fish in great dismay
    Inside the net they struggling lay.But willing hands were overhead,
    And quickly from the muddy bed
    Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled
    The dripping net was upward hauled,
    With all the Brownies clinging fast,
    Till safe on deck they stood at last.[Illustration]

                    Sometimes a mule fell off the road
                    And in the stream with all its load.Then precious time would be consumed
    Before the trip could be resumed.Thus on they went from mile to mile,
    With many strange mishaps the while,
    But working bravely through the night
    Until the city came in sight.Said one: "Now, thanks to bearded goats
    And patient mules, the heavy boats
    For hours have glided on their way,
    And reached the waters of the bay.But see, the sun's about to show
    His colors to the world below,
    And other birds than those of night
    Begin to take their morning flight.Our time is up; we've done our best;
    The ebbing tide must do the rest;
    Now drifting downward to their pier
    Let barges unassisted steer,
    While we make haste, with nimble feet,
    To find in woods a safe retreat."[Illustration]

[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES IN THE STUDIO.The Brownies once approached in glee
    A slumbering city by the sea."In yonder town," the leader cried,
    "I hear the artist does reside
    Who pictures out, with patient hand,
    The doings of the Brownie band.""I'd freely give," another said,
    "The cap that now protects my head,
    To find the room, where, day by day,
    He shows us at our work or play."A third replied: "Your cap retain
    To shield your poll from snow or rain.His studio is farther down,
    Within a corner-building brown.So follow me a mile or more
    And soon we'll reach the office door."[Illustration]

    Then through the park, around the square,
    And down the broadest thoroughfare,
    The anxious Brownies quickly passed,
    And reached the building huge at last.[Illustration]

        They paused awhile to view the sight,
        To speak about its age and height,
        And read the signs, so long and wide,
        That met the gaze on every side.But little time was wasted there,
                For soon their feet had found the stair.And next the room, where oft are told
                Their funny actions, free and bold,
                Was honored by a friendly call
                From all the Brownies, great and small.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Then what a gallery they found,
                As here and there they moved around--
                For now they gaze upon a scene
                That showed them sporting on the green;
                Then, hastening o'er the fields with speed
                To help some farmer in his need.Said one, "Upon this desk, no doubt,
                Where now we cluster round about,
                Our doings have been plainly told
    From month to month, through heat and cold.And there's the ink, I apprehend,
    On which our very lives depend.Be careful, moving to and fro,
    Lest we upset it as we go.For who can tell what tales untold
            That darksome liquid may unfold!"[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            A telephone gave great delight
            To those who tried it half the night,
            Some asking after fresh supplies;
    Or if their stocks were on the rise;
    What ship was safe; what bank was firm;
    Or who desired a second term.Thus messages ran to and fro
    With "Who are you?"And all the repetitions known
    To those who use the telephone.[Illustration]

    "Oh, here's the pen, as I opine,"
    Said one, "that's written every line;
    Indebted to this pen are we
    For all our fame and history.""See here," another said, "I've found
    The pointed pencil, long and round,
    That pictures all our looks so wise,
            Our smiles so broad and staring eyes;
            'Tis well it draws us all aright,
            Or we might bear it off to-night.But glad are we to have our name
            In every region known to fame,
            To know that children lisp our praise,
            And on our faces love to gaze."Old pistols that brave service knew
    At Bunker Hill, were brought to view
    In mimic duels on the floor,
    And snapped at paces three or four;
    While from the foils the Brownies plied,
    The sparks in showers scattered wide,
    As thrust and parry, cut and guard,
    In swift succession followed hard.The British and Mongolian slash
    Were tried in turn with brilliant dash,
    Till foils, and skill, and temper too,
    Were amply tested through and through.[Illustration]

    They found old shields that bore the dint
    Of spears and arrow-heads of flint,
    And held them up in proper pose;
    Then rained upon them Spartan blows.[Illustration]

    Lay figures, draped in ancient styles,
    From some drew graceful bows and smiles,
    Until the laugh of comrades nigh
    Led them to look with sharper eye.A portrait now they criticize,
    Which every one could recognize:
    The features, garments, and the style,
    Soon brought to every face a smile.Some tried a hand at painting there,
    And showed their skill was something rare;
    While others talked and rummaged through
    The desk to find the stories new,
    That told about some late affair,
    Of which the world was not aware.But pleasure seemed to have the power
    To hasten every passing hour,
    And bring too soon the morning chime,
    However well they note the time.Now, from a chapel's brazen bell,
    The startling hint of morning fell,
    And Brownies realized the need
    Of leaving for their haunts with speed.So down the staircase to the street
    They made their way with nimble feet,
    And ere the sun could show his face,
    The band had reached a hiding-place.[Illustration: IMPROVEMENTS IN PRINTING MACHINERY.1]

A CHARACTERISTIC MINING "RUSH."--THE PROSPECTIVE MINING CENTER OF
SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO.A correspondent of the _Tribune_ describes at length the mining camps
about Lake Valley, New Mexico, hitherto thought likely to be the central
camp of that region, and then graphically tells the story of the recent
"rush" to the Perche district.Within a month of the first strike of
silver ore the country was swarming with prospectors, and a thousand or
more prospects had been located.The Perche district is on the eastern flanks of the Mimbres Mountains,
a range which is a part of the Rocky Mountain range, and runs north and
south generally parallel with the Rio Grande, from which it lies about
forty miles to the westward.The northern half of these mountains is
known as the Black Range, and was the center of considerable mining
excitement a year and a half ago.It is there that the Ivanhoe is
located, of which Colonel Gillette was manager, and in which Robert
Ingersoll and Senator Plumb, of Kansas, were interested, much to the
disadvantage of the former.A new company has been organized, however,
with Colonel Ingersoll as president, and the reopening of work on the
Ivanhoe will probably prove a stimulus to the whole Black Range.From
this region the Perche district is from forty to sixty miles south.It
is about twenty-five miles northwest of Lake Valley, and ten miles west
of Hillsboro, a promising little mining town, with some mills and about
300 people.The Perche River has three forks coming down from the
mountains and uniting at Hillsboro, and it is in the region between
these forks that the recent strikes have been made.On August 15 "Jack" Shedd, the original discoverer of the Robinson mine
in Colorado, was prospecting on the south branch of the north fork of
the Perche River, when he made the first great strike in the district.On the summit of a heavily timbered ridge he found some small pieces of
native silver, and then a lump of ore containing very pure silver in the
form of sulphides, weighing 150 pounds, and afterward proved to be worth
on the average $11 a pound.All this was mere float, simply lying on the
surface of the ground.Afterward another block was found, weighing 87
pounds, of horn silver, with specimens nearly 75 per cent.The
strike was kept a secret for a few days.Said a mining man: "I went up
to help bring the big lump down.We took it by a camp of prospectors who
were lying about entirely ignorant of any find.When they saw it they
instantly saddled their horses, galloped off, and I believe they
prospected all night."A like excitement was created when the news of
this and one or two similar finds reached Lake Valley.Next morning
every waiter was gone from the little hotel, and a dozen men had left
the Sierra mines, to try their fortunes at prospecting.As the news spread men poured into the Perche district from no one knows
where, some armed with only a piece of salt pork, a little meal, and a
prospecting pick; some mounted on mules, others on foot; old men and men
half-crippled were among the number, but all bitten by the monomania
which possesses every prospector.Now there are probably 2,000 men in
the Perche district, and the number of prospects located must far exceed
1,000.Three miners from there with whom I was talking recently owned
forty-seven mines among them, and while one acknowledged that hardly one
prospect in a hundred turns out a prize, the other millionaire in embryo
remarked that he wouldn't take $50,000 for one of his mines.So it goes,
and the victims of the mining fever here seem as deaf to reason as the
buyers of mining stock in New York.Fuel was added to the flame by
the report that Shedd had sold his location, named the Solitaire, to
ex-Governor Tabor and Mr.Wurtzbach on August 25 for $100,000.I met Governor Tabor's representative, who came down recently
to examine the properties, and learned that the Governor had not up to
that date bought the mine.He undoubtedly bonded it, however, and his
representative's opinion of the properties seemed highly favorable.The Solitaire showed what appeared to be a contact vein, with walls of
porphyry and limestone in a ledge thirty feet wide in places, containing
a high assay of horned silver.The vein was composed of quartz, bearing
sulphides, with horn silver plainly visible, giving an average assay of
from $350 to $500.These were the results shown
simply by surface explorations, which were certainly exceedingly
promising.Recently it has been stated that a little development shows
the vein to be only a blind lead, but the statement lacks confirmation.In any case the effect of so sensational a discovery is the same in
creating an intense excitement and attracting swarms of prospectors.But the Perche district does not rest on the Solitaire, for there has
been abundance of mineral wealth discovered throughout its extent.Four
miles south of this prospect, on the middle fork of the Perche, is an
actual mine--the Bullion--which was purchased by four or five Western
mining men for $10,000, and yielded $11,000 in twenty days.The ore
contains horn and native silver.On the same fork are the Iron King and
Andy Johnson, both recently discovered and promising properties, and
there is a valuable mine now in litigation on the south fork of the
Perche, with scores of prospects over the entire district.Now that one
or two sensational strikes have attracted attention, and capital is
developing paying mines, the future of the Perche District seems
assured.*       *       *       *       *




THE SOY BEAN.The _British Medical Journal_ says that Prof.E. Kinch, writing in the
_Agricultural Students' Gazette_, says that the Soy bean approaches more
nearly to animal food than any other known vegetable production, being
singularly rich in fat and in albuminoids.It is largely used as
an article of food in China and Japan.Efforts have been made to
acclimatize it in various parts of the continent of Europe, and fair
success has been achieved in Italy and France; many foods are made from
it and its straw is a useful fodder.*       *       *       *       *




ON A NEW ARC ELECTRIC LAMP.[Footnote: Paper read at the British Association, Southampton.Revised
by the Author.--_Nature_.]Electric lamps on the arc principle are almost as numerous as the trees
in the forest, and it is somewhat fresh to come upon something that is
novel.In these lamps the carbons are consumed as the current flows, and
it is the variation in their consumption which occasions the flickering
and irregularity of the light that is so irritating to the eyes.Special
mechanical contrivances or regulators have to be used to compensate for
this destruction of the carbons, as in the Siemens and Brush type, or
else refractory materials have to be combined with the carbons, as in
the Jablochkoff candle and in the lamp Soleil.The steadiness of the
light depends upon the regularity with which the carbons are moved
toward each other as they are consumed, so as to maintain the electric
resistance between them a constant quantity.Each lamp must have a
certain elasticity of regulation of its own, to prevent irregularities
from the variable material of carbon used, and from variations in the
current itself and in the machinery.In all electric lamps, except the Brockie, the regulator is in the lamp
itself.In the Brockie system the regulation is automatic, and is made
at certain rapid intervals by the motor engine.This causes a periodic
blinking that is detrimental to this lamp for internal illumination.M. Abdank, the inventor of the system which I have the pleasure of
bringing before the Section, separates his regulator from his lamp.The regulator may be fixed anywhere, within easy inspection and
manipulation, and away from any disturbing influence in the lamp.The
lamp can be fixed in any inaccessible place.--The bottom or negative carbon is fixed,
but the top or positive carbon is movable, in a vertical line.It is
screwed at the point, C, to a brass rod, T (Fig.2), which moves freely
inside the tubular iron core of an electromagnet, K. This rod is
clutched and lifted by the soft iron armature, A B, when a current
passes through the coil, M M. The mass of the iron in the armature is
distributed so that the greater portion is at one end, B, much nearer
the pole than the other end.Hence this portion is attracted first, the
armature assumes an inclined position, maintained by a brass button, t,
which prevents any adhesion between the armature and the core of the
electromagnet.The electric connection between the carbon and the coil
of the electromagnet is maintained by the flexible wire, S.1), is fixed to a long and heavy rack, C,
which falls by its own weight and by the weight of the electromagnet and
the carbon fixed to it.The length of the rack is equal to the length of
the two carbons.The fall of the rack is controlled by a friction break,
B (Fig.3), which acts upon the last of a train of three wheels put
in motion by the above weight.The break, B, is fixed at one end of
a lever, B A, the other end carrying a soft iron armature, F,
easily adjusted by three screws.This armature is attracted by the
electromagnet, E E (whose resistance is 1,200 ohms), whenever a current
circulates through it.The length of the play is regulated by the screw,
V. The spring, L, applies tension to the break._The Regulator_.--This consists of a balance and a cut-off.4 and 5) is made with two solenoids.S and S',
whose relative resistances is adjustable.S conveys the main current,
and is wound with thick wire having practically no resistance, and S'
is traversed by a shunt current, and is wound with fine wire having a
resistance of 600 ohms.In the axes of these two coils a small and light
iron tube (2 mm.length) freely moves in a vertical
line between two guides.When magnetized it has one pole in the middle
and the other at each end.The upward motion is controlled by the
spring, N T. The spring rests upon the screw, H, with which it makes
contact by platinum electrodes.This contact is broken whenever the
little iron rod strikes the spring, N T.

The positive lead from the dynamo is attached to the terminal, B, then
passes through the coil, S, to the terminal, B', whence it proceeds to
the lamp.The negative lead is attached to terminal, A, passing directly
to the other terminal, A', and thence to the lamp.4]

The shunt which passes through the fine coil, S', commences at the
point, P. The other end is fixed to the screw, H, whence it has two
paths, the one offering no resistance through the spring, T N, to the
upper negative terminal, A'; the other through the terminal, J, to the
electromagnet of the break, M, and thence to the negative terminal of
the lamp, L'._The Cut-off_.--The last part of the apparatus (Fig.4) to be described
is the cut-off, which is used when there are several lamps in series.It
is brought into play by the switch, C D, which can be placed at E or D.
When it is at E, the negative terminal, A, is in communication with
the positive terminal, B, through the resistance, R, which equals the
resistance of the lamp, which is, therefore, out of circuit.When it is
at D the cut-off acts automatically to do the same thing when required.This is done by a solenoid, V, which has two coils, the one of thick
wire offering no resistance, and the other of 2,000 ohms resistance.The
fine wire connects the terminals, A' and B. The solenoid has a movable
soft iron core suspended by the spring, U. It has a cross-piece of iron
which can dip into two mercury cups, G and K, when the core is sucked
into the solenoid.When this is the case, which happens when any
accident occurs to the lamp, the terminal, A, is placed in connection
with the terminal, B, through the thick wire of V and the resistance, R,
in the same way as it was done by the switch, C D._Electrical Arrangement_.--The mode in which several lamps are connected
up in series is shown by Fig.The + lead is
connected to B1 of the balance it then passes to the lamp, L, returning
to the balance, and then proceeds to each other lamp, returning finally
to the negative pole of the machine.When the current enters the balance
it passes through the coil, S, magnetizing the iron core and drawing
it downward (Fig.It then passes to the lamp, L L', through the
carbons, then returns to the balance, and proceeds back to the negative
terminal of the machine.A small portion of the current is shunted off
at the point, P, passing through the coil, S', through the contact
spring, T N, to the terminal, A', and drawing the iron core in
opposition to S. The carbons are in contact, but in passing through
the lamp the current magnetizes the electromagnet, M (Fig.2), which
attracts the armature, A B, that bites and lifts up the rod, T, with the
upper carbon, a definite and fixed distance that is easily regulated
by the screws, Y Y. The arc then is formed, and will continue to burn
steadily as long as the current remains constant.But the moment the
current falls, due to the increased resistance of the arc, a greater
proportion passes through the shunt, S' (Fig.4), increasing its
magnetic moment on the iron core, while that of S is diminishing.The
result is that a moment arrives when equilibrium is destroyed, the iron
rod strikes smartly and sharply upon the spring, N T. Contact between T
and H is broken, and the current passes through the electromagnet of the
break in the lamp.The break is released for an instant, the carbons
approach each other.But the same rupture of contact introduces in the
shunt a new resistance of considerable magnitude (viz., 1,200 ohms),
that of the electromagnets of the break.Then the strength of the shunt
current diminishes considerably, and the solenoid, S, recovers briskly
its drawing power upon the rod, and contact is restored.The carbons
approach during these periods only about 0.01 to 0.02 millimeter.If this is not sufficient to restore equilibrium it is repeated
continually, until equilibrium is obtained.The result is that the
carbon is continually falling by a motion invisible to the eye, but
sufficient to provide for the consumption of the carbons.6]

The contact between N T and H is never completely broken, the sparks are
very feeble, and the contacts do not oxidize.The resistances inserted
are so considerable that heating cannot occur, while the portion of the
current abstracted for the control is so small that it may be neglected.The balance acts precisely like the key of a Morse machine, and the
break precisely like the sounder-receiver so well known in telegraphy.It emits the same kind of sounds, and acts automatically like a skilled
and faithful telegraphist.This regulation, by very small and short successive steps, offers
several advantages: (1) it is imperceptible to the eye; (2) it does not
affect the main current; (3) any sudden instantaneous variation of the
main current does not allow a too near approach of the carbon points.Let, now, an accident occur; for instance, a carbon is broken.At once
the automatic cut-off acts, the current passes through the resistance,
R, instead of passing through the lamp.The current through the fine
coil is suddenly increased, the rod is drawn in, contact is made at G
and K, and the current is sent through the coil, R. As soon as contact
is again made by the carbons, the current in the coil, S, is increased,
that of the thick wire in V diminished, and the antagonistic spring,
U, breaks the contact at G and K. The rupture of the light is almost
invisible, because the relighting is so brisk and sharp.I have seen this lamp in action, and its constant steadiness leaves
nothing to be desired.*       *       *       *       *




APPARATUS FOR OBTAINING PURE WATER FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC USE.Our readers are well aware that water as found naturally is never
absolutely free from dissolved impurities; and in ordinary cases it
contains solid impurities derived both from the inorganic and organic
kingdoms, together with gaseous substances; these latter being generally
derived from the atmosphere.By far the purest water which occurs in nature is rain-water, and if
this be collected in a secluded district, and after the air has been
well washed by previous rain, its purity is remarkable; the extraneous
matter consisting of little else than a trace of carbonic acid and other
gases dissolved from the air.In fact, such water is far purer than any
distilled water to be obtained in commerce.The case is very different
when the rain-water is collected in a town or densely populated
district, more especially if the water has been allowed to flow over
dirty roofs.The black and foully-smelling liquid popularly known as
soft water is so rich in carbonaceous and organic constituents as to be
of very limited use to the photographer; but by taking the precaution of
fitting up a simple automatic shunt for diverting the stream until the
roofs have been thoroughly washed, it becomes possible to insure a good
supply of clean and serviceable soft water, even in London.Several
forms of shunt have been devised, some of these being so complex as
to offer every prospect of speedy disorganization; but a simple and
efficient apparatus is figured in _Engineering_ by a correspondent who
signs himself "Millwright," and as we have thoroughly proved the value
of an apparatus which is practically identical, we reproduce the
substance of his communication.A gentleman of Newcastle, a retired banker, having tried various filters
to purify the rain-water collected on the roof of his house, at length
had the idea to allow no water to run into the cistern until the roof
had been well washed.After first putting up a hard-worked valve, the
arrangement as sketched below has been hit upon.Now Newcastle is a very
smoky place, and yet my friend gets water as pure as gin, and almost
absolutely free from any smack of soot.[Illustration]

The sketch explains itself.The weight, W, and the angle of the lever,
L, are such, that when the valve, V, is once opened it goes full open.A
small hole in the can C, acts like a cataract, and brings matters to a
normal state very soon after the rain ceases.The proper action of the apparatus can only be insured by a careful
adjustment of the weight, W, the angle through which the valve opens,
and the magnitude of the vessel, C. It is an advantage to make
the vessel, C, somewhat broader in proportion to its height than
represented, and to provide it with a movable strainer placed about half
way down.This tends to protect the cataract hole, and any accumulation
of leaves and dirt can be removed once in six months or so.Clean soft
water is valuable to the photographer in very many cases.Iron developer
(wet plate) free from chlorides will ordinarily remain effective on the
plate much longer than when chlorides are present, and the pyrogallic
solution for dry-plate work will keep good for along time if made with
soft water, while the lime which is present in hard water causes the
pyrogallic acid to oxidize with considerable rapidity.Negatives that
have been developed with oxalate developer often become covered with a
very unsightly veil of calcium oxalate when rinsed with hard water, and
something of a similar character occasionally occurs in the case of
silver prints which are transferred directly from the exposure frame to
impure water.To the carbon printer clean rain-water is of considerable value, as he
can develop much more rapidly with soft water than with hard water;
or, what comes to the same thing, he can dissolve away his superfluous
gelatine at a lower temperature than would otherwise be necessary.The cleanest rain-water which can ordinarily be collected in a town is
not sufficiently pure to be used with advantage in the preparation of
the nitrate bath, it being advisable to use the purest distilled water
for this purpose; and in many cases it is well to carefully distill
water for the bath in a glass apparatus of the kind figured below.[Illustration]

A, thin glass flask serving as a retort.The tube, T, is fitted
air-tight to the flask by a cork, C.

B, receiver into which the tube, T, fits quite loosely.D, water vessel intended to keep the spiral of lamp wick, which is shown
as surrounding T, in a moist condition.This wick acts as a siphon, and
water is gradually drawn over into the lower receptacle, E.

L, spirit lamp, which may, in many cases, be advantageously replaced by
a Bunsen burner.A small metal still, provided with a tin condensing worm, is, however, a
more generally serviceable arrangement, and if ordinary precautions are
taken to make sure that the worm tube is clean, the resulting distilled
water will be nearly as pure as that distilled in glass vessels.Such a still as that figured below can be heated conveniently over an
ordinary kitchen fire, and should find a place among the appliances
of every photographer.Distilled water should always be used in the
preparation of emulsion, as the impurities of ordinary water may often
introduce disturbing conditions.--_Photographic News_.[Illustration]

BLACK PHOSPHORUS.The author refers to the customary view that black phosphorus is
merely a mixture of the ordinary phosphorus with traces of a metallic
phosphide, and contends that this explanation is not in all cases
admissible.A specimen of black or rather dark gray phosphorus, which
the author submitted to the Academy, became white if melted and remained
white if suddenly cooled, but if allowed to enter into a state of
superfusion it became again black on contact with either white or black
phosphorus.A portion of the black specimen being dissolved in carbon
disulphide there remained undissolved merely a trace of a very pale
yellow matter which seemed to be amorphous phosphorus.--_Comptes

SCHREIBER'S APPARATUS FOR REVIVIFYING BONE-BLACK.We give opposite illustrations of Schreiber's apparatus for revivifying
bone-black or animal charcoal.The object of revivification is to render
the black fit to be used again after it has lost its decolorizing
properties through service--that is to say, to free its pores from the
absorbed salts and insoluble compounds that have formed therein
during the operation of sugar refining.There are two methods
employed--fermentation and washing.At present the tendency is to
abandon the former in order to proceed with as small a stock of black as
possible, and to adopt the method of washing with water and acid in a
rotary washer.1 and 2 represent a plan and elevation of a bone-black room,
containing light filters, A, arranged in a circle around wells, B. These
latter have the form of a prism with trapezoidal base, whose small sides
end at the same point, d, and the large ones at the filter.The funnel,
E, of the washer, F, is placed in the space left by the small ends of
the wells, so that the black may be taken from these latter and thrown
directly into the washer.The washer is arranged so that the black may
flow out near the steam fitter, G, beneath the floor.The discharge of
this filter is toward the side of the elevator, H, which takes in the
wet black below, and carries it up and pours it into the drier situated
at the upper part of the furnace.3 and 4, is
formed of two vertical wooden uprights, A, ten centimeters in thickness,
to which are fixed two round-iron bars the same as guides.The lift,
properly so-called, consists of an iron frame, C, provided at the four
angles with rollers, D, and supporting a swinging bucket, E, which, on
its arrival at the upper part of the furnace, allows the black to fall
to an inclined plane that leads it to the upper part of the drier.The
left is raised and lowered by means of a pitch-chain, F, fixed to the
middle of the frame, C, and passing over two pulleys, G, at the upper
part of the frame and descending to the mechanism that actuates it.This latter comprises a nut, I, acting directly on the chain; a toothed
wheel, K, and a pinion, J, gearing with the latter and keyed upon the
shaft of the pulleys, L and M. The diameter of the toothed wheel, K, is
0.295 of a meter, and it makes 53.4 revolutions per minute.The diameter
of the pinion is 0.197 of a meter, and it makes 80 revolutions per
minute.The pulleys, M and L, are 0.31 of a meter in diameter, and
make 80 revolutions per minute.Motion is transmitted to them by other
pulleys, N, keyed upon a shaft placed at the lower part, which receives
its motion from the engine of the establishment through the intermedium
of the pulley, O. The diameter of the latter is 0.385 of a meter, and
that of N is 0.58.1.--ELEVATION OF BONE-BLACK REVIVIFYING PLANT
(SCHREIBER'S SYSTEM.)3.--LATERAL VIEW OF ELEVATOR.4.--FRONT VIEW OF ELEVATOR.5.--CONTINUOUS FURNACE FOR REVIVIFYING BONE-BLACK.]The elevator is set in motion by the simple maneuver of the gearing
lever, P, and when this has been done all the other motions are effected
automatically._The Animal Black Furnace_.--This consists of a masonry casing of
rectangular form, in which are arranged on each side of the same
fire-place two rows of cast-iron retorts, D, of undulating form, each
composed of three parts, set one within the other.These retorts, which
serve for the revivification of the black, are incased in superposed
blocks of refractory clay, P, Q, S, designed to regularize the
transmission of heat and to prevent burning.These pieces are kept in
their respective places by crosspieces, R. The space between the retorts
occupied by the fire-place, Y, is covered with a cylindrical dome, O, of
refractory tiles, forming a fire-chamber with the inner surface of the
blocks, P, Q, and S. The front of the surface consists of a cast-iron
plate, containing the doors to the fire-place and ash pan, and a larger
one to allow of entrance to the interior to make repairs.One of the principal disadvantages of furnaces for revivifying animal
charcoal has been that they possessed no automatic drier for drying the
black on its exit from the washer.It was for the purpose of remedying
this that Mr.Schreiber was led to invent the automatic system of drying
shown at the upper part of the furnace, and which is formed of two
pipes, B, of undulating form, like the retorts, with openings throughout
their length for the escape of steam.Between these pipes there is a
closed space into which enters the waste heat and products of combustion
from the furnace.These latter afterward escape through the chimney at
the upper part.In order that the black may be put in bags on issuing from the furnace,
it must be cooled as much as possible.For this purpose there are
arranged on each side of the furnace two pieces of cast iron tubes, F,
of rectangular section, forming a prolongation of the retorts and making
with them an angle of about 45 degrees.The extremities of these tubes
terminate in hollow rotary cylinders, G, which permit of regulating the
flow of the black into a car, J (Fig.From what precedes, it will be readily understood how a furnace is run
on this plan.The bone-black in the hopper, A, descends into the drier, B, enters the
retorts, D, and, after revivification, passes into the cooling pipes, F,
from whence it issues cold and ready to be bagged.A coke fire having
been built in the fire-place, Y, the flames spread throughout the fire
chamber, direct themselves toward the bottom, divide into two parts to
the right and left, and heat the back of the retorts in passing.Then
the two currents mount through the lateral flues, V, and unite so as to
form but one in the drier.Within the latter there are arranged plates
designed to break the current from the flames, and allow it to heat all
the inner parts of the pipes, while the apertures in the drier allow of
the escape of the steam.By turning one of the cylinders, G, so as to present its aperture
opposite that of the cooler, it instantly fills up with black.At this
moment the whole column, from top to bottom, is set in motion.The
bone-black, in passing through the undulations, is thrown alternately to
the right and left until it finally reaches the coolers.This operation
is repeated as many times as the cylinder is filled during the descent
of one whole column, that is to say, about forty times.With an apparatus of the dimensions here described, 120 hectoliters
of bone-black may be revivified in twenty four hours, with 360 to 400
kilogrammes of coke.--_Annales Industrielles_.*       *       *       *       *

[Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No.SOAP AND ITS MANUFACTURE, FROM A CONSUMER'S POINT OF VIEW.In our last article, under the above heading, the advantages to be
gained by the use of potash soap as compared with soda soap were pointed
out, and the reasons of this superiority, especially in the case of
washing wool or woolen fabrics, were pretty fully gone into.It was also
further explained why the potash soaps generally sold to the public were
unfit for general use, owing to their not being neutral--that is to say,
containing a considerable excess of free or unsaponified alkali, which
acts injuriously on the fiber of any textile material, and causes sore
hands if used for household or laundry purposes.It was shown that the
cause of this defect was owing to the old-fashioned method of making
potash or soft soap, by boiling with wood ashes or other impure form of
potash; but that a perfectly pure and neutral potash soap could readily
be made with pure caustic potash, which within the last few years has
become a commercial article, manufactured on a large scale; just in
the same manner as the powdered 98 per cent.caustic soda, which was
recommended in our previous articles on making hard soap without
boiling.The process of making pure neutral potash soap is very simple, and
almost identical with that for making hard soap with pure powdered
caustic soda.The following directions, if carefully and exactly
followed, will produce a first-class potash soap, suitable either for
the woolen manufacturer for washing his wool, and the cloth afterward
made from it, or for household and laundry purposes, for which uses it
will be found far superior to any soda soap, no matter how pure or well
made it may be.Dissolve twenty pounds of pure caustic potash in two gallons of water.Pure caustic potash is very soluble, and dissolves almost immediately,
heating the water.Let the lye thus made cool until warm to the
hand--say about 90 F. Melt eighty pounds of tallow or grease, which must
be free from salt, and let it cool until fairly hot to the hand--say
130 F.; or eighty pounds of any vegetable or animal oil may be taken
instead.Now pour the caustic potash lye into the melted tallow or oil,
stirring with a flat wooden stirrer about three inches broad, until both
are thoroughly mixed and smooth in appearance.This mixing may be done
in the boiler used to melt the tallow, or in a tub, or half an oil
barrel makes a good mixing vessel.Wrap the tub or barrel well up in
blankets or sheepskins, and put away for a week in some warm dry place,
during which the mixture slowly turns into soap, giving a produce of
about 120 pounds of excellent potash soap.If this soap is made with
tallow or grease it will be nearly as hard as soda soap.When made by
farmers or householders tallow or grease will generally be taken, as it
is the cheapest, and ready to hand on the spot.For manufacturers, or
for making laundry soap, nothing could be better than cotton seed oil.A
magnificent soap can be made with this article, lathering very freely.When made with oil it is better to remelt in a kettle the potash soap,
made according to the above directions, with half its weight of water,
using very little heat, stirring constantly, and removing the fire as
soon as the water is mixed with and taken up by the soap.A beautifully
bright soap is obtained in this way, and curiously the soap is actually
made much harder and stiffer by this addition of water than when it is
in a more concentrated state previously to the water being added.With reference to the caustic potash for making the soap, it can be
obtained in all sizes of drums, but small packages just sufficient for
a batch of soap are generally more economical than larger packages, as
pure caustic potash melts and deteriorates very quickly when exposed
to the air.The Greenbank Alkali Co., of St.Helens, seems to have
appreciated this, and put upon the market pure caustic potash in twenty
pound canisters, which are very convenient for potash soft soap making
by consumers for their own use.While on this subject of caustic potash, it cannot be too often repeated
that _caustic potash_ is a totally different article to _caustic soda_,
though just like it in appearance, and therefore often sold as such.One of the most barefaced instances of this is the so-called "crystal
potash," "ball potash," or "rock potash," of the lye packers, sold in
one pound packages, which absolutely, without exception, do not contain
a single grain of potash, but simply consist of caustic soda more or
less adulterated--as a rule very much "more" than "less!"It is much
to be regretted that this fraud on the public has been so extensively
practiced, as potash has been greatly discredited by this procedure.The subject of fleece scouring or washing the wool while growing on
the sheep, with a potash soap made on the spot with the waste tallow
generally to be had on every sheep farm, seems recently to have been
attracting attention in some quarters, and certainly would be a source
of profit to sheep owners by putting their wool on the market in the
best condition, and at the same time cleaning the skin of the sheep.It
therefore appears to be a move in the right direction.In concluding this series of articles on practical soap making from a
consumer's point of view, the writer hopes that, although the subject
has been somewhat imperfectly handled, owing to necessarily limited
space and with many unavoidable interruptions, yet that they may have
been found of some interest and assistance to consumers of soap who
desire easily and readily to make a pure and unadulterated article for
their own use.*       *       *       *       *




COTTON SEED OIL.Having had occasion during the last six years to manufacture lead
plaster in considerable quantities, it occurred to me that cotton seed
oil might be used instead of olive oil, at less expense, and with as
good results.The making of this plaster with cotton seed oil has been
questioned, as, according to some authorities, the product is not of
good consistence, and is apt to be soft, sticky, and dark colored;
but in my experience such is not the case.If the U. S. P. process is
followed in making this plaster, substituting for the olive oil cotton
seed oil, and instead of one half-pint of boiling water one and one-half
pint are added, the product obtained will be equally as good as that
from olive oil.My results with this oil in making lead plaster led me
to try it in making the different liniments of the Pharmacopoeia, with
the following results:

_Linimentum Ammoniae_.--This liniment, made with cotton seed oil, is of
much better consistency than when made with olive oil.It is not so
thick, will pour easily out of the bottle, and if the ammonia used is of
proper strength, will make a perfect liniment._Linimentum Calcis_.--Cotton seed oil is not at all adapted to making
this liniment.It does not readily saponify, separates quickly, and it
is almost impossible to unite when separated._Linimentum Camphorae_.--Cotton seed oil is far superior to olive oil in
making this liniment, it being a much better solvent of camphor.It has
not that disagreeable odor so commonly found in the liniment._Linimentum Chloroformi_.--Cotton seed oil being very soluble in
chloroform, the liniment made with it leaves nothing to be desired._Linimentum Plumbi Subacetatis_.--When liq.is mixed
with cotton seed oil and allowed to stand for some time the oil assumes
a reddish color similar to that of freshly made tincture of myrrh.When
the liquor is mixed with olive oil, if the oil be pure, no such change
takes place.Noticing this change, it occurred to me that this would be
a simple and easy way to detect cotton seed oil when mixed with olive
oil.This change usually takes place after standing from twelve to
twenty-four hours.It is easily detected in mixtures containing five
per cent., or even less, of the oils, and I am convinced, after making
numerous experiments with different oils, that it is peculiar to cotton
seed oil.--_American Journal of Pharmacy_.*       *       *       *       *




THE FOOD AND ENERGY OF MAN.[Footnote: From a lecture delivered at the Sanitary Congress, at
Newcastle-on-Tyne, September 28, 1882.]DE CHAUMONT, F.R.S.Although eating cannot be said to be in any way a new fashion, it has
nevertheless been reserved for modern times, and indeed we may say the
present generation, to get a fairly clear idea of the way in which
food is really utilized for the work of our bodily frame.We must not,
however, plume ourselves too much upon our superior knowledge, for
inklings of the truth, more or less dim, have been had through all ages,
and we are now stepping into the inheritance of times gone by, using the
long and painful experience of our predecessors as the stepping-stone
to our more accurate knowledge of the present time.In this, as in many
other things, we are to some extent in the position of a dwarf on the
shoulders of a giant; the dwarf may, indeed, see further than the giant;
but he remains a dwarf, and the giant a giant.The question has been much discussed as to what the original food of man
was, and some people have made it a subject of excited contention.The
most reasonable conclusion is that man is naturally a frugivorous or
fruit-eating animal, like his cousins the monkeys, whom he still so
much resembles.This forms a further argument in favor of his being
originated in warm regions, where fruits of all kinds were plentiful.It
is pretty clear that the resort to animal food, whether the result of
the pressure of want from failure of vegetable products, or a mere taste
and a desire for change and more appetizing food, is one that took place
many ages ago, probably in the earliest anthropoid, if not in the latest
pithecoid stage.No doubt some advantage was recognized in the more
rapid digestion and the comparative ease with which the hunter or fisher
could obtain food, instead of waiting for the ripening of fruits in
countries which had more or less prolonged periods of cold and inclement
weather.Some anatomical changes have doubtless resulted from the
practice, but they are not of sufficiently marked character to found
much argument upon; all that we can say being that the digestive
apparatus in man seems well adapted for digesting any food that is
capable of yielding nutriment, and that even when an entire change is
made in the mode of feeding, the adaptability of the human system
shows itself in a more or less rapid accommodation to the altered
circumstances.Food, then, is any substance which can be taken into the body and
applied to use, either in building up or repairing the tissues and
framework of the body itself, or in providing energy and producing
animal heat, or any substance which, without performing those functions
directly, controls, directs, or assists their performance.With this
wide definition it is evident that we include all the ordinary articles
recognized commonly as food, and that we reject all substances
recognized commonly as poisons.But it will also include such substances
as water and air, both of which are essential for nutrition, but are not
usually recognized as belonging to the list of food substances in the
ordinary sense.When we carry our investigation further, we find that
the organic substances may be again divided into two distinct classes,
namely, that which contains nitrogen (the casein), and those that do not
(the butter and sugar).On ascertaining this, we are immediately struck with the remarkable fact
that all the tissues and fluids of the body, muscles (or flesh),
bone, blood--all, in short, except the fat--contain nitrogen, and,
consequently, for their building up in the young, and for their repair
and renewal in the adult, nitrogen is absolutely required.We therefore
reasonably infer that the nitrogenous substance is necessary for this
purpose.Experiment has borne this out, for men who have been compelled
to live without nitrogenous food by dire necessity, and criminals on
whom the experiment has been tried, have all perished sooner or later in
consequence.When nitrogenous substances are used in the body, they
are, of course, broken up and oxidized, or perhaps we ought to say more
accurately, they take the place of the tissues of the body which wear
away and are carried off by oxidation and other chemical changes.Now, modern science tell us that such changes are accompanied with
manifestations of energy in some form or other, most frequently in
that of heat, and we must look, therefore, upon nitrogenous food
as contributing to the energy of the body in addition to its other
functions.What are the substances which we may class as nitrogenous.In the first
place, we have the typical example of the purest form in _albumin_,
or white of egg; and from this the name is now given to the class of
_albuminates_.The animal albuminates are: Albumin from eggs, fibrin
from muscles, or flesh, myosin, or synronin, also from animals, casein
(or cheesy matter) from milk, and the nitrogenous substances from blood.In the vegetable kingdom, we have glutin, or vegetable fibrin, which is
the nourishing constituent of wheat, barley, oats, etc.; and legumin,
or vegetable casein, which is the peculiar substance found in peas and
beans.The other organic constituents--viz., the fats and the starches
and sugars--contain no nitrogen, and were at one time thought to be
concerned in producing animal heat.We now know--thanks to the labors of Joule, Lyon Playfair, Clausius,
Tyndall, Helmholtz, etc.--that heat itself is a mode of motion, a form
of convertible energy, which can be made to do useful or productive
work, and be expressed in terms of actual work done.Modern experiment
shows that all our energy is derived from that of food, and, in
particular from the non-nitrogenous part of it, that is, the fat,
starch, and sugar.The nutrition of man is best maintained when he is
provided with a due admixture of all the four classes of aliment which
we have mentioned, and not only that, but he is also better off if he
has a variety of each class.Thus he may and ought to have albumen,
fibrine, gluten, and casein among the albuminates, or at least two of
them; butter and lard, or suet, or oil among the fats; starch of wheat,
potato, rice, peas, etc., and cane-sugar, and milk-sugar among the
carbo-hydrates.The salts cannot be replaced, so far as we know.Life
may be maintained in fair vigor for some time on albuminates only, but
this is done at the expense of the tissues, especially the fat of the
body, and the end must soon come; with fat and carbo hydrates alone
vigor may also be maintained for some time, at the expense of the
tissues also, but the limit is a near one, In either of these cases we
suppose sufficient water and salts to be provided.We must now inquire into the quantities of food necessary; and this
necessitates a little consideration of the way in which the work of
the body is carried on.We must look upon the human body exactly as a
machine; like an engine with which we are all so familiar.A certain
amount of work requires to be done, say, a certain number of miles of
distance to be traversed; we know that to do this a certain number of
pounds, or hundredweights, or tons of coal must be put into the fire of
the boiler in order to furnish the requisite amount of energy through
the medium of steam.This amount of fuel must bear a certain proportion
to the work, and also to the velocity with which it is done, so both
quantity and time have to be accounted for.No lecture on diet would be complete without a reference to the vexed
question of alcohol.I am no teetotal advocate, and I repudiate the
rubbish too often spouted from teetotal platforms, talk that is,
perhaps, inseparable from the advocacy of a cause that imports a good
deal of enthusiasm.I am at one, however, in recognizing the evils of
excess, and would gladly hail their diminution.But I believe that
alcohol properly used may be a comfort and a blessing, just as I know
that improperly used it becomes a bane and a curse.But we are now
concerned with it as an article of diet in relation to useful work, and
it may be well to call attention markedly to the fact that its use in
this way is very limited.Parkes, made
in our laboratory, at Netley, were conclusive on the point, that beyond
an amount that would be represented by about one and a half to two pints
of beer, alcohol no longer provided any convertible energy, and that,
therefore, to take it in the belief that it did do so is an error.It may give a momentary stimulus in considerable doses, but this is
invariably followed by a corresponding depression, and it is a maxim now
generally followed, especially on service, never to give it before or
during work.There are, of course, some persons who are better without
it altogether, and so all moderation ought to be commended, if not
enjoyed.There are other beverages which are more useful than the alcoholic,
as restoratives, and for support in fatigue.Another excellent restorative is a weak solution
of Liebig's extract of meat, which has a remarkable power of removing
fatigue.Perhaps one of the most useful and most easily obtainable is
weak oatmeal gruel, either hot or cold.With regard to tobacco, it also
has some value in lessening fatigue in those who are able to take it,
but it may easily be carried to excess.Of it we may say, as of alcohol,
that in moderation it seems harmless, and even useful to some extent,
but, in excess, it is rank poison.There is one other point which I must refer to, and which is especially
interesting to a great seaport like this.This is the question of
scurvy--a question of vital importance to a maritime nation.Thomas Gray, of the Board of Trade, discloses the
regrettable fact that since 1873 there has been a serious falling off,
the outbreaks of scurvy having again increased until they reached
ninety-nine in 1881.Gray seems to think, is due to a neglect
of varied food scales; but it may also very probably have arisen from
the neglect of the regulation about lime-juice, either as to issue or
quality, or both.But it is also a fact of very great importance that
mere monotony of diet has a most serious effect upon health; variety
of food is not merely a pandering to gourmandism or greed, but a real
sanitary benefit, aiding digestion and assimilation.Our Board of Trade
has nothing to do with the food scales of ships, but Mr.Gray hints that
the Legislature will have to interfere unless shipowners look to it
themselves.The ease with which preserved foods of all kinds can be
obtained and carried now removes the last shadow of an excuse for
backwardness in this matter, and in particular the provision of a large
supply of potatoes, both fresh and dried, ought to be an unceasing care;
this is done on board American ships, and to this is doubtless owing in
a great part the healthiness of their crews.Scurvy in the present
day is a disgrace to shipowners and masters; and if public opinion is
insufficient to protect the seamen, the legislature will undoubtedly
step in and do so.And now let me close by pointing out that the study of this commonplace
matter of eating and drinking opens out to us the conception of the
grand unity of nature; since we see that the body of man differs in no
way essentially from other natural combinations, but is subject to
the same universal physical laws, in which there is no blindness, no
variableness, no mere chance, and disobedience of which is followed as
surely by retribution as even the keenest eschatologist might desire.*       *       *       *       *




RATTLESNAKE POISON.By HENRY H. CROFT.Some time since, in a paper to which I am unfortunately unable to refer,
a French chemist affirmed that the poisonous principle in snakes, or
eliminated by snakes, was of the nature of an alkaloid, and gave a name
to this class of bodies.Pedler has shown that snake poison is destroyed or neutralized
by means of platinic chloride, owing probably to the formation of an
insoluble double platinic chloride, such as is formed with almost if not
all alkaloids.In this country (Texas) where rattlesnakes are very common, and persons
camping out much exposed to their bites, a very favorite anecdote, or
_remedia_ as the Mexicans cull it, is a strong solution of iodine in
potassium iodide.[1]

[Footnote 1: The solution is applied as soon as possible to the wound,
preferably enlarged, and a few drops taken internally.The common
Mexican _remedia_ is the root of the _Agave virginica_ mashed or chewed
and applied to the wound, while part is swallowed.Great faith is placed in this root by all residents here, who are seldom
I without it, but, I have had no experience of it myself; and the
internal administration is no doubt useless.Even the wild birds know of this root; the queer paisano (?ground
woodpecker) which eats snakes, when wounded by a _vibora de cascabel_,
runs into woods, digs up and eats a root of the agave, just like the
mongoose; but more than that, goes back, polishes off his enemy, and
eats him.This has been told me by Mexicans who, it may be remarked, are
not _always_ reliable.]I have had occasion to prove the efficacy of this mixture in two cases
of _cascabel_ bites, one on a buck, the other on a dog; and it occurred
to me that the same explanation of its action might be given as above
for the platinum salt, viz., the formation of an insoluble iodo compound
as with ordinary alkaloids if the snake poison really belongs to this
class.Having last evening killed a moderate sized rattlesnake--_Crotalus
horridus_--which had not bitten anything, I found the gland fully
charged with the white opaque poison; on adding iodine solution to a
drop of this a dense light-brown precipitate was immediately formed,
quite similar to that obtained with most alkaloids, exhibiting under the
microscope no crystalline structure.In the absence of iodine a good extemporaneous solution for testing
alkaloids, and perhaps a snake poison antidote, may be made by adding a
few drops of ferric chloride to solution of potassium of iodide; this
is a very convenient test agent which I used in my laboratory for many
years.Although rattlesnake poison could be obtained here in very considerable
quantity, it is out of my power to make such experiments as I could
desire, being without any chemical appliances and living a hundred miles
or more from any laboratory.The same may be said with regard to books,
and possibly the above iodine reaction has been already described.Richards states that the cobra poison is destroyed by potassium
permanganate; but this is no argument in favor of that salt as an
antidote.Pedler also refers to it, but allows that it would not be
probably of any use after the poison had been absorbed.Of this I
think there can be no doubt, remembering the easy decomposition of
permanganate by most organic substances, and I cannot but think that the
medicinal or therapeutic advantages of that salt, taken internally, are
equally problematical, unless the action is supposed to take place in
the stomach.In the bladder of the same rattlesnake I found a considerable
quantity of light-brown amorphous ammonium urate, the urine pale
yellow.--_Chemical News_.*       *       *       *       *




THE CHINESE SIGN MANUAL.D. J. Macgowan, in Medical Reports of China.Two writers in _Nature_, both having for their theme "Skin-furrows on
the Hand," solicit information on the subject from China.[1] As the
subject is considered to have a bearing on medical jurisprudence and
ethnology as well, this report is a suitable vehicle for responding to
the demand.[Footnote 1: Henry Faulds, Tzukiyi Hospital, Tokio, Japan.W. J.
Herschel, Oxford, England.--_Nature_, 28th October and 25th November,
1880.]Faulds' observations on the finger-tips of the Japanese have an
ethnic bearing and relate to the subject of heredity.Herschel
considers the subject as an agent of Government, he having charge for
twenty years of registration offices in India, where he employed finger
marks as sign manuals, the object being to prevent personation and
repudiation.Doolittle, in his "Social Life of the Chinese," describes
the custom.I cannot now refer to native works where the practice of
employing digital rugae as a sign manual is alluded to.I doubt if its
employment in the courts is of ancient date.Well-informed natives think
that it came into vogue subsequent to the Han period; if so, it is in
Egypt that earliest evidence of the practice is to be found.Just as the
Chinese courts now require criminals to sign confessions by impressing
thereto the whorls of their thumb-tips--the right thumb in the case of
women, the left in the case of men--so the ancient Egyptians, it
is represented, required confessions to be sealed with their
thumbnails--most likely the tip of the digit, as in China.Great
importance is attached in the courts to this digital form of signature,
"finger form."Without a confession no criminal can be legally executed,
and the confession to be valid must be attested by the thumb-print
of the prisoner.No direct coercion is employed to secure this; a
contumacious culprit may, however, be tortured until he performs the
act which is a prerequisite to his execution.Digital signatures are
sometimes required in the army to prevent personation; the general
in command at Wenchow enforces it on all his troops.A document thus
attested can no more be forged or repudiated than a photograph--not so
easily, for while the period of half a lifetime effects great changes
in the physiognomy, the rugae of the fingers present the same appearance
from the cradle to the grave; time writes no wrinkles there.In the
army everywhere, when the description of a person is written down, the
relative number of volutes and coniferous finger-tips is noted.It
is called taking the "whelk striae," the fusiform being called "rice
baskets," and the volutes "peck measures."A person unable to write, the
form of signature which defies personation or repudiation is required in
certain domestic cases, as in the sale of children or women.Often when
a child is sold the parents affix their finger marks to the bill of
sale; when a husband puts away his wife, giving her a bill of divorce,
he marks the document with his entire palm; and when a wife is sold, the
purchaser requires the seller to stamp the paper with hands and feet,
the four organs duly smeared with ink.Professional fortune tellers in
China take into account almost the entire system of the person whose
future they attempt to forecast, and of course they include palmistry,
but the rugae of the finger-ends do not receive much attention.Amateur
fortune-tellers, however, discourse as glibly on them as phrenologists
do of "bumps"--it is so easy.In children the relative number of volute
and conical striae indicate their future."If there are nine volutes,"
says a proverb, "to one conical, the boy will attain distinction without
toil."Regarded from an ethnological point of view, I can discover merely that
the rugae of Chinamen's fingers differ from Europeans', but there is so
little uniformity observable that they form no basis for distinction,
and while the striae may be noteworthy points in certain medico-legal
questions, heredity is not one of them.*       *       *       *       *




LUCIDITY.At the close of an interesting address lately delivered at the reopening
of the Liverpool University College and School of Medicine, Mr.Matthew
Arnold said if there was one word which he should like to plant in the
memories of his audience, and to leave sticking there after he had gone,
it was the word _lucidity_.If he had to fix upon the three great wants
at this moment of the three principal nations of Europe, he should say
that the great want of the French was morality, that the great want of
the Germans was civil courage, and that our own great want was lucidity.Our own want was, of course, what concerned us the most.People were apt
to remark the defects which accompanied certain qualities, and to think
that the qualities could not be desirable because of the defects which
they saw accompanying them.There was no greater and salutary lesson for
men to learn than that a quality may be accompanied, naturally perhaps,
by grave dangers; that it may actually present itself accompanied by
terrible defects, and yet that it might itself be indispensable.Let him
illustrate what he meant by an example, the force of which they would
all readily feel.Seriousness was a quality of our nation.Perhaps
seriousness was always accompanied by certain dangers.But, at any rate,
many of our French neighbors would say that they found our seriousness
accompanied by so many false ideas, so much prejudice, so much that was
disagreeable, that it could not have the value which we attributed to
it.Let them follow the same
mode of reasoning as to the quality of lucidity.The French had a
national turn for lucidity as we had a national turn for seriousness.Perhaps a national turn for lucidity carried with it always certain
dangers.Be this as it might, it was certain that we saw in the French,
along with their lucidity, a want of seriousness, a want of reverence,
and other faults, which greatly displeased us.Many of us were inclined
in consequence to undervalue their lucidity, or to deny that they
had it.We were wrong: it existed as our seriousness existed; it was
valuable as our seriousness was valuable.Both the one and the other
were valuable, and in the end indispensable.It was negatively that the French have it, and he
would therefore deal with its negative character merely.Negatively,
lucidity was the perception of the want of truth and validness in
notions long current, the perception that they are no longer possible,
that their time is finished, and they can serve us no more.All through
the last century a prodigious travail for lucidity was going forward
in France.Its principal agent was a man whose name excited generally
repulsion in England, Voltaire.Voltaire did a great deal of harm in
France.But it was not by his lucidity that he did harm; he did it by
his want of seriousness, his want of reverence, his want of sense for
much that is deepest in human nature.Conduct was three-fourths of life, and a man who
worked for conduct, therefore, worked for more than a man who worked for
intelligence.But having promised this, it might be said that the Luther
of the eighteenth century and of the cultivated classes was Voltaire.As Luther had an antipathy to what was immoral, so Voltaire had an
antipathy to what was absurd, and both of them made war upon the object
of their antipathy with such masterly power, with so much conviction,
so much energy, so much genius, that they carried their world with
them--Luther his Protestant world, and Voltaire his French world--and
the cultivated classes throughout the continent of Europe generally.Voltaire had more than negative lucidity; he had the large and true
conception that a number and equilibrium of activities were necessary
for man."_Il faut douner a notre ame toutes les formes possibles_"
was a maxim which Voltaire really and truly applied in practice,
"advancing," as Michelet finely said of him, in every direction with
a marvelous vigor and with that conquering ambition which Vico called
_mens heroica_.Voltaire's signal characteristic was his
lucidity, his negative lucidity.There was a great and free intellectual movement in England in the
eighteenth century--indeed, it was from England that it passed into
France; but the English had not that strong natural bent for lucidity
which the French had.Our leading thinkers had not the genius and passion for lucidity which
distinguished Voltaire.In their free inquiry they soon found themselves
coming into collision with a number of established facts, beliefs,
conventions.Thereupon all sorts of practical considerations began to
sway them.The danger signal went up, they often stopped short, turned
their eyes another way, or drew down a curtain between themselves and
the light."It seems highly probable," said Voltaire, "that nature has
made thinking a portion of the brain, as vegetation is a function of
trees; that we think by the brain just as we walk by the feet."So our
reason, at least, would lead us to conclude, if the theologians did not
assure us of the contrary; such, too, was the opinion of Locke, but he
did not venture to announce it.The French Revolution came, England grew
to abhor France, and was cut off from the Continent, did great things,
gained much, but not in lucidity.The Continent was reopened, the
century advanced, time and experience brought their lessons, lovers of
free and clear thought, such as the late John Stuart Mill, arose among
us.But we could not say that they had by any means founded among us the
reign of lucidity.Let them consider that movement of which we were hearing so much just
now: let them look at the Salvation Army and its operations.They would
see numbers, funds, energy, devotedness, excitement, conversions, and
a total absence of lucidity.A little lucidity would make the whole
movement impossible.That movement took for granted as its basis what
was no longer possible or receivable; its adherents proceeded in all
they did on the assumption that that basis was perfectly solid, and
neither saw that it was not solid, nor ever even thought of asking
themselves whether it was solid or not.Taking a very different movement, and one of far higher dignity and
import, they had all had before their minds lately the long-devoted,
laborious, influential, pure, pathetic life of Dr.Pusey, which had just
ended.Many of them had also been reading in the lively volumes of that
acute, but not always good-natured rattle, Mr.Mozley, an account of
that great movement which took from Dr.Of its
later stage of Ritualism they had had in this country a now celebrated
experience.It had produced men to
be respected, men to be admired, men to be beloved, men of learning,
goodness, genius, and charm.But could they resist the truth that
lucidity would have been fatal to it?The movers of all those questions
about apostolical succession, church patristic authority, primitive
usage, postures, vestments--questions so passionately debated, and on
which he would not seek to cast ridicule--did not they all begin by
taking for granted something no longer possible or receivable, build on
this basis as if it were indubitably solid, and fail to see that their
basis not being solid, all they built upon it was fantastic?He would not say that negative lucidity was in itself a satisfactory
possession, but he said that it was inevitable and indispensable, and
that it was the condition of all serious construction for the future.Without it at present a man or a nation was intellectually and
spiritually all abroad.If they saw it accompanied in France by much
that they shrank from, they should reflect that in England it would
have influences joined with it which it had not in France--the natural
seriousness of the people, their sense of reverence and respect, their
love for the past.Come it must; and here where it had been so late in
coming, it would probably be for the first time seen to come without
danger.Capitals were natural centers of mental movement, and it was natural for
the classes with most leisure, most freedom, most means of cultivation,
and most conversance with the wide world to have lucidity though often
they had it not.To generate a spirit of lucidity in provincial towns,
and among the middle classes bound to a life of much routine and plunged
in business, was more difficult.Schools and universities, with serious
and disinterested studies, and connecting those studies the one with the
other and continuing them into years of manhood, were in this case the
best agency they could use.It might be slow, but it was sure.Such
an agency they were now going to employ.Might it fulfill all their
expectations!Might their students, in the words quoted just now,
advance in every direction with a marvelous vigor, and with that
conquering ambition which Vico called _mens heroica_!And among the many
good results of this, might one result be the acquisition in their midst
of that indispensable spirit--the spirit of lucidity!*       *       *       *       *




ON SOME APPARATUS THAT PERMIT OF ENTERING FLAMES.[Footnote: A. de Rochas in the _Revue Scientifique_.]In the following notes I shall recall a few experiments that indicate
under what conditions the human organism is permitted to remain unharmed
amid flames.These experiments were published in England in 1882, in the
twelfth letter from Brewster to Walter Scott on natural magic.They are,
I believe, not much known in France, and possess a practical interest
for those who are engaged in the art of combating fires.At the end of the last century Humphry Davy observed that, on placing a
very fine wire gauze over a flame, the latter was cooled to such a
point that it could not traverse the meshes.This phenomenon, which he
attributed to the conductivity and radiating power of the metal, he soon
utilized in the construction of a lamp for miners.Some years afterward Chevalier Aldini, of Milan, conceived the idea of
making a new application of Davy's discovery in the manufacture of an
envelope that should permit a man to enter into the midst of flames.This envelope, which was made of metallic gauze with 1-25th of an inch
meshes, was composed of five pieces, as follows: (1) a helmet, with
mask, large enough, to allow a certain space between it and the internal
bonnet of which I shall speak; (2) a cuirass with armlets; (3) a skirt
for the lower part of the belly and the thighs; (4) a pair of boots
formed of a double wire gauze; and (5) a shield five feet long by one
and a half wide, formed of metallic gauze stretched over a light iron
frame.Beneath this armor the experimenter was clad in breeches and a
close coat of coarse cloth that had previously been soaked in a solution
of alum.The head, hands, and feet were covered by envelopes of asbestos
cloth whose fibers were about a half millimeter in diameter.The bonnet
contained apertures for the eyes, nose, and ears, and consisted of a
single thickness of fabric, as did the stockings, but the gloves were of
double thickness, so that the wearer could seize burning objects with
the hands.Aldini, convinced of the services that his apparatus might render to
humanity, traveled over Europe and gave gratuitous representations with
it.The exercises generally took place in the following order: Aldini
began by first wrapping his finger in asbestos and then with a double
layer of wire gauze.He then held it for some instants in the flame of
a candle or alcohol lamp.One of his assistants afterward put on the
asbestos glove of which I have spoken, and, protecting the palm of his
hand with another piece of asbestos cloth, seized a piece of red-hot
iron from a furnace and slowly carried it to a distance of forty or
fifty meters, lighted some straw with it, and then carried it back to
the furnace.On other occasions, the experimenters, holding firebrands
in their hands, walked for five minutes over a large grating under which
fagots were burning.In order to show how the head, eyes, and lungs were protected by the
wire gauze apparatus, one of the experimenters put on the asbestos
bonnet, helmet, and cuirass, and fixed the shield in front of his
breast.Then, in a chafing dish placed on a level with his shoulder, a
great fire of shavings was lighted, and care was taken to keep it up.Into the midst of these flames the experimenter then plunged his head
and remained thus five or six minutes with his face turned toward them.In an exhibition given at Paris before a committee from the Academic
des Sciences, there were set up two parallel fences formed of straw,
connected by iron wire to light wicker work, and arranged so as to leave
between them a passage 3 feet wide by 30 long.The heat was so intense,
when the fences were set on fire, that no one could approach nearer than
20 or 25 feet; and the flames seemed to fill the whole space between
them, and rose to a height of 9 or 10 feet.Six men clad in the Aldini
suit went in, one behind the other, between the blazing fences, and
walked slowly backward and forward in the narrow passage, while the fire
was being fed with fresh combustibles from the exterior.One of these
men carried on his back, in an ozier basket covered with wire gauze, a
child eight years of age, who had on no other clothing than an asbestos
bonnet.This same man, having the child with him, entered on another
occasion a clear fire whose flames reached a height of 18 feet, and
whose intensity was such that it could not be looked at.He remained
therein so long that the spectators began to fear that he had succumbed;
but he finally came out safe and sound.One of the conclusions to be drawn from the facts just stated is that
man can breathe in the midst of flames.This marvelous property cannot
be attributed exclusively to the cooling of the air by its passage
through the gauze before reaching the lungs; it shows also a very great
resistance of our organs to the action of heat.The following, moreover,
are direct proofs of such resistance.In England, in their first
experiment, Messrs.Joseph Banks, Charles Blagden, and Dr.Solander
remained for ten minutes in a hot-house whose temperature was 211 deg.Fahr., and their bodies preserved therein very nearly the usual heat.On
breathing against a thermometer they caused the mercury to fall several
degrees.Each expiration, especially when it was somewhat strong,
produced in their nostrils an agreeable impression of coolness, and the
same impression was also produced on their fingers when breathed upon.When they touched themselves their skin seemed to be as cold as that of
a corpse; but contact with their watch chains caused them to experience
a sensation like that of a burn.A thermometer placed under the tongue
of one of the experimenters marked 98 deg.Fahr., which is the normal
temperature of the human species.Emboldened by these first results, Blagden entered a hot-house in which
the thermometer in certain parts reached 262 deg.He remained therein
eight minutes, walked about in all directions, and stopped in the
coolest part, which was at 240 deg.During all this time he
experienced no painful sensations; but, at the end of seven minutes, he
felt an oppression of the lungs that inquieted him and caused him to
leave the place.His pulse at that moment showed 144 beats to the
minute, that is to say, double what it usually did.To ascertain whether
there was any error in the indications of the thermometer, and to find
out what effect would take place on inert substances exposed to the hot
air that he had breathed, Blogden placed some eggs in a zinc plate in
the hot-house, alongside the thermometer, and found that in twenty
minutes they were baked hard.A case is reported where workmen entered a furnace for drying moulds, in
England, the temperature of which was 177 deg., and whose iron sole plate
was so hot that it carbonized their wooden shoes.In the immediate
vicinity of this furnace the temperature rose to 160 deg.Persons not of
the trade who approached anywhere near the furnace experienced pain in
the eyes, nose, and ears.A baker is cited in Angoumois, France, who spent ten minutes in a
furnace at 132 deg.C.

The resistance of the human organism to so high temperatures can be
attributed to several causes.First, it has been found that the quantity
of carbonic acid exhaled by the lungs, and consequently the chemical
phenomena of internal combustion that are a source of animal heat,
diminish in measure as the external temperature rises.Hence, a conflict
which has for result the retardation of the moment at which a living
being will tend, without obstacle, to take the temperature of the
surrounding medium.On another hand, it has been observed that man
resists heat so much the less in proportion as the air is saturated
with vapors.Berger, who supported for seven minutes a temperature
varying from 109 deg.C. in dry air, could remain only twelve
minutes in a bagnio whose temperature rose from 41 deg.At the
Hammam of Paris the highest temperature obtained is 87 deg., and Dr.E.
Martin has not been able to remain therein more than five minutes.This
physician reports that in 1743, the thermometer having exceeded 40 deg.at
Pekin, 14,000 persons perished.These facts are explained by the cooling
that the evaporation of perspiration produces on the surface of the
body.Edwards has calculated that such evaporation is ten times greater
in dry air in motion than in calm and humid air.The observations become
still more striking when the skin is put in contact with a liquid or a
solid which suppresses perspiration.Lemoine endured a bath of Bareges
water of 37 deg.for half an hour; but at 45 deg.he could not remain in it more
than seven minutes, and the perspiration began to flow at the end of six
minutes.According to Brewster, persons who experience no malaise near
a fire which communicates a temperature of 100 deg.C. to them, can hardly
bear contact with alcohol and oil at 55 deg.The facts adduced permit us to understand how it was possible to bear
one of the proofs to which it is said those were submitted who wished
to be initiated into the Egyptian mysteries.In a vast vaulted chamber
nearly a hundred feet long, there were erected two fences formed of
posts, around which were wound branches of Arabian balm, Egyptian thorn,
and tamarind--all very flexible and inflammable woods.When this was set
on fire the flames arose as far as the vault, licked it, and gave the
chamber the appearance of a hot furnace, the smoke escaping through
pipes made for the purpose.Then the door was suddenly opened before the
neophyte, and he was ordered to traverse this burning place, whose floor
was composed of an incandescent grating.The Abbe Terrason recounts all these details in his historic romance
"Sethos," printed at the end of last century.Unfortunately literary
frauds were in fashion then, and the book, published as a translation of
an old Greek manuscript, gives no indication of sources.I have sought
in special works for the data which the abbe must have had as a basis,
but I have not been able to find them.I suppose, however, that
this description, which is so precise, is not merely a work of the
imagination.The author goes so far as to give the dimensions of the
grating (30 feet by 8), and, greatly embarrassed to explain how his hero
was enabled to traverse it without being burned, is obliged to suppose
it to have been formed of very thick bars, between which Sethos had care
to place his feet.He who had the
courage to rush, head bowed, into the midst of the flames, certainly
would not have amused himself by choosing the place to put his feet.Braving the fire that surrounded his entire body, he must have had no
other thought than that of reaching the end of his dangerous voyage as
soon as possible.We cannot see very well, moreover, how this immense
grate, lying on the ground, was raised to a red heat and kept at such a
temperature.It is infinitely more simple to suppose that between the
two fences there was a ditch sufficiently deep in which a fire had
also been lighted, and which was covered by a grating as in the Aldini
experiments.It is even probable that this grating was of copper,
which, illuminated by the fireplace, must have presented a terrifying
brilliancy, while in reality it served only to prevent the flames from
the fireplace reaching him who dared to brave them.*       *       *       *       *




THE BUILDING STONE SUPPLY.The use of stone as a building material was not resorted to, except to
a trifling extent, in this country until long after the need of such a
solid substance was felt.The early settler contented himself with the
log cabin, the corduroy road, and the wooden bridge, and loose stone
enough for foundation purposes could readily be gathered from the
surface of the earth.Even after the desirability of more handsome and
durable building material for public edifices in the colonial cities
than wood became apparent, the ample resources which nature had afforded
in this country were overlooked, and brick and stone were imported by
the Dutch and English settlers from the Old World.Thus we find the
colonists of the New Netherlands putting yellow brick on their list
of non-dutiable imports in 1648; and such buildings in Boston as are
described as being "fairly set forth with brick, tile, slate, and
stone," were thus provided only with foreign products.Isolated
instances of quarrying stone are known to have occurred in the last
century; but they are rare.The edifice known as "King's Chapel,"
Boston, erected in 1752, is the first one on record as being built from
American stone; this was granite, brought from Braintree, Mass.Granite is a rock particularly abundant in New England, though also
found in lesser quantities elsewhere in this country.The first granite
quarries that were extensively developed were those at Quincy, Mass.,
and work began at that point early in the present century.The fame of
the stone became widespread, and it was sent to distant markets--even to
New Orleans.The old Merchants' Exchange in New York (afterward used as
a custom house) the Astor House in that city, and the Custom House in
New Orleans, all nearly or quite fifty years old, were constructed of
Quincy granite, as were many other fine buildings along the Atlantic
coast.In later years, not only isolated public edifices, but also whole
blocks of stores, have been constructed of this material.It was from
the Quincy quarries that the first railroad in this country was built;
this was a horse-railroad, three miles long, extending to Neponset
River, built in 1827.Other points in Massachusetts have been famed for their excellent
granite.After Maine was set off as a distinct State, Fox Island
acquired repute for its granite, and built up an extensive traffic
therein.Westerly, R.I., has also been engaged in quarrying this
valuable rock for many years, most of its choicer specimens having been
wrought for monumental purposes.Statues and other elaborate monumental
designs are now extensively made therefrom.Smaller pieces and a coarser
quality of the stone are here and elsewhere along the coast obtained in
large quantities for the construction of massive breakwaters to protect
harbors.Another point famous for its granite is Staten Island, New
York.This stone weighs 180 pounds to the cubic foot, while the Quincy
granite weighs but 165.The Staten Island product is used not only for
building purposes, but is also especially esteemed for paving after both
the Russ and Belgian patents.New York and other cities derive large
supplies from this source.The granite of Weehawken, N.J., is of the
same character, and greatly in demand.Port Deposit, Md., and Richmond,
Va, are also centers of granite production.Near Abbeville, S.C., and
in Georgia, granite is found quite like that of Quincy.Much southern
granite, however, decomposes readily, and is almost as soft as clay.This variety of stone is found in great abundance in the Rocky
Mountains; but, except to a slight extent in California, it is not yet
quarried there.Granite, having little grain, can be cut into blocks of almost any size
and shape.Specimens as much as eighty feet long have been taken out and
transported great distances.The quarrying is done by drilling a series
of small holes, six inches or more deep and almost the same distance
apart, inserting steel wedges along the whole line and then tapping each
gently with a hammer in succession, in order that the strain may be
evenly distributed.A building material that came into use earlier than granite is known as
freestone or sandstone; although its first employment does not date back
further than the erection of King's Chapel, Boston, already referred to
as the earliest well-known occasion where granite was used in building.Altogether the most famous American sandstone quarries are those at
Portland, on the Connecticut River, opposite Middletown.These were
worked before the Revolution; and their product has been shipped to many
distant points in the country.The long rows of "brownstone fronts" in
New York city are mostly of Portland stone, though in many cases the
walls are chiefly of brick covered with thin layers of the stone.The
old red sandstone of the Connecticut valley is distinguished in geology
for the discovery of gigantic fossil footprints of birds, first noticed
in the Portland quarries in 1802.Some of these footprints measured
ten to sixteen inches, and they were from four to six feet apart.The
sandstone of Belleville, N.J., has also extensive use and reputation.Trinity Church in New York city and the Boston Atheneum are built of the
product of these quarries; St.Lawrence County, New York, is noted also
for a fine bed of sandstone.At Potsdam it is exposed to a depth of
seventy feet.There are places though, in New England, New York, and
Eastern Pennsylvania, where a depth of three hundred feet has been
reached.The Potsdam sandstone is often split to the thinness of an
inch.It hardens by exposure, and is often used for smelting furnace
hearth-stones.Shawangunk Mountain, in Ulster County, yields a sandstone
of inferior quality, which has been unsuccessfully tried for paving;
as it wears very unevenly.From Ulster, Greene, and Albany Counties
sandstone slabs for sidewalks are extensively quarried for city use;
the principal outlets of these sections being Kingston, Saugerties,
Coxsackie, Bristol, and New Baltimore, on the Hudson.In this region
quantities amounting to millions of square feet are taken out in large
sheets, which are often sawed into the sizes desired.The vicinity of
Medina, in Western New York, yields a sandstone extensively used in that
section for paving and curbing, and a little for building.A rather poor
quality of this stone has been found along the Potomac, and some of it
was used in the erection of the old Capitol building at Washington.Ohio yields a sandstone that is of a light gray color; Berea, Amherst,
Vermilion, and Massillon are the chief points of production.Genevieve, Mo., yields a stone of fine grain of a light straw color,
which is quite equal to the famous Caen stone of France.The Lake
Superior sandstones are dark and coarse grained, but strong.In some parts of the country, where neither granite nor sandstone
is easily procured, blue and gray limestone are sometimes used for
building, and, when hammer dressed, often look like granite.A serious
objection to their use, however, is the occasional presence of iron,
which rusts on exposure, and defaces the building.In Western New York
they are widely used.Topeka stone, like the coquine of Florida and
Bermuda, is soft like wood when first quarried, and easily wrought,
but it hardens on exposure.The limestones of Canton, Mo., Joliet and
Athens, Ill., Dayton, Sandusky, Marblehead, and other points in Ohio,
Ellittsville, Ind., and Louisville and Bowling Green, Ky., are great
favorites west.In many of these regions limestone is extensively used
for macadamizing roads, for which it is excellently adapted.It also
yields excellent slabs or flags for sidewalks.One of the principal uses of this variety of stone is its conversion, by
burning, into lime for building purposes.All limestones are by no
means equally excellent in this regard.Thomaston lime, burned with
Pennsylvania coal, near the Penobscot River, has had a wide reputation
for nearly half a century.It has been shipped thence to all points
along the Atlantic coast, invading Virginia as far as Lynchburg, and
going even to New Orleans, Smithfield, R.I., and Westchester County,
N.Y., near the lower end of the Highlands, also make a particularly
excellent quality of lime.Kingston, in Ulster County, makes an inferior
sort for agricultural purposes.The Ohio and other western stones yield
a poor lime, and that section is almost entirely dependent on the east
for supplies.Marbles, like limestones, with which they are closely related, are very
abundant in this country, and are also to be found in a great variety of
colors.As early as 1804 American marble was used for statuary purposes.Early in the century it also obtained extensive employment for
gravestones.Its use for building purposes has been more recent than
granite and sandstone in this country; and it is coming to supersede the
latter to a great degree.For mantels, fire-places, porch pillars, and
like ornamental purposes, however, our variegated, rich colored and
veined or brecciated marbles were in use some time before exterior walls
were made from them.Among the earliest marble buildings were Girard
College in Philadelphia and the old City Hall in New York, and the
Custom House in the latter city, afterward used for a sub-treasury.The
new Capitol building at Washington is among the more recent structures
composed of this material.Our exports of marble to Cuba and elsewhere
amount to over $300,000 annually, although we import nearly the same
amount from Italy.And yet an article can be found in the United States
fully as fine as the famous Carrara marble.We refer to that which comes
from Rutland, Vt.This state yields the largest variety and choicest
specimens.The marble belt runs both ways from Rutland County, where
the only quality fit for statuary is obtained.Toward the north it
deteriorates by growing less sound, though finer in grain; while to
the south it becomes coarser.A beautiful black marble is obtained at
Shoreham, Vt.There are also handsome brecciated marbles in the same
state; and in the extreme northern part, near Lake Champlain, they
become more variegated and rich in hue.Such other marble as is found
in New England is of an inferior quality.The pillars of Girard
College came from Berkshire, Mass., which ranks next after Vermont in
reputation.The marble belt extends from New England through New York, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia, Tennessee, and the
Carolinas, to Georgia and Alabama.Some of the variegated and high
colored varieties obtained near Knoxville, Tenn., nearly equal that of
Vermont.The Rocky Mountains contain a vast abundance and variety.Slate was known to exist in this country to a slight extent in colonial
days.It was then used for gravestones, and to some extent for roofing
and school purposes.It is
stated that a slate quarry was operated in Northampton County, Pa., as
early as 1805.In 1826 James M. Porter and Samuel Taylor engaged in the
business, obtaining their supplies from the Kittanninny Mountains.From
this time the business developed rapidly, the village of Slateford being
an outgrowth of it, and large rafts being employed to float the product
down the Schuylkill to Philadelphia.By 1860 the industry had reached
the capacity of 20,000 cases of slate, valued at $10 a case, annually.In 1839 quarries were opened in the Piscataquis River, forty miles
north of Bangor, Me., but poor transportation facilities retarded the
business.Vermont began to yield in 1852.New York's quarries are
confined to Washington County, near the Vermont line.Maryland has
a limited supply from Harford County.The Huron Mountains, north of
Marquette, Mich., contain slate, which is also said to exist in Pike
County, Ga.Grindstones, millstones, and whetstones are quarried in New York, Ohio,
Michigan, Pennsylvania, and other States.Mica is found at Acworth and
Grafton, N. H., and near Salt Lake, but our chief supply comes from
Haywood, Yancey, Mitchell, and Macon counties, in North Carolina, and
our product is so large that we can afford to export it.Other stones,
such as silex, for making glass, etc., are found in profusion in various
parts of the country, but we have no space to enter into a detailed
account of them at present.--_Pottery and Glassware Reporter_.*       *       *       *       *




AN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.The most interesting change of which the Census gives account is the
increase in the number of farms.The number has virtually doubled within
twenty years.The population of the country has not increased in like
proportion.A large part of the increase in number of farms has been due
to the division of great estates.Nor has this occurred, as some may
imagine, exclusively in the Southern States and the States to which
immigration and migration have recently been directed.It is an
important fact that the multiplication of farms has continued even in
the older Northern States, though the change has not been as great in
these as in States of the far West or the South.In New York there has
been an increase of 25,000, or 11.5 per cent, in the number of farms
since 1870; in New Jersey the increase has been 12.2 per cent., and in
Pennsylvania 22.7 per cent., though the increase in population, and
doubtless in the number of persons engaged in farming, has been much
smaller.Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois also, have been considered fully
settled States for years, at least in an agricultural point of view, and
yet the number of farms has increased 26.1 per cent, in ten years in
Ohio, 20.3 percent, in Indiana, and 26.1 per cent, in Illinois.The
obvious explanation is that the growth of many cities and towns has
created a market for a far greater supply of those products which may be
most advantageously grown upon farms of moderate size; but even if this
fully accounts for the phenomenon, the change must be recognized as one
of the highest importance industrially, socially, and politically.The
man who owns or rents and cultivates a farm stands on a very different
footing from the laborer who works for wages.It is not a small matter
that, in these six States alone, there are 205,000 more owners or
managers of farms than there were only a decade ago.As we go further toward the border, west or north, the influence of the
settlement of new land is more distinctly felt.Even in Michigan, where
new railroads have opened new regions to settlement, the increase in
number of farms has been over 55 per cent.In Wisconsin, though the
increase in railroad mileage has been about the same as in Michigan, the
reported increase in number of farms has been only 28 per cent., but in
Iowa it rises to 60 per cent., and in Minnesota to nearly 100 per cent.In Kansas the number of farms is 138,561, against 38,202 in 1870; in
Nebraska 63,387, against 12,301; and in Dakota 17,435, against 1,720.In
these regions the process is one of creation of new States rather than a
change in the social and industrial condition of the population.Some Southern States have gained largely, but the increase in these,
though very great, is less surprising than the new States of the
Northwest.The prevailing tendency of Southern agriculture to large
farms and the employment of many hands is especially felt in States
where land is still abundant.The greatest increase is in Texas, where
174,184 farms are reported, against 61,125 in 1870; in Florida, with
23,438 farms, against 10,241 in 1870; and in Arkansas, with 94,433
farms, against 49,424 in 1870.In Missouri 215,575 farms are reported,
against 148,228 in 1870.In these States, though social changes have
been great, the increase in number of farms has been largely due to new
settlements, as in the States of the far Northwest.But the change in
the older Southern States is of a different character.Virginia, for example, has long been settled, and had 77,000 farms
thirty years ago.But the increase in number within the past ten years
has been 44,668, or 60.5 per cent.Contrasting this with the increase in
New York, a remarkable difference appears.West Virginia had few more
farms ten years ago than New Jersey; now it has nearly twice as many,
and has gained in number nearly 60 per cent.North Carolina, too, has
increased 78 per cent.in number of farms since 1870, and South Carolina
80 per cent.In Georgia the increase has been still greater--from 69,956
to 138,626, or nearly 100 per cent.In Alabama there are 135,864
farms, against 67,382 in 1870, an increase of over 100 per cent.These
proportions, contrasted with those for the older Northern States, reveal
a change that is nothing less than an industrial revolution.But the
force of this tendency to division of estates has been greatest in the
States named.Whereas the ratio of increase in number of farms becomes
greater in Northern States as we go from the East toward the Mississippi
River, at the South it is much smaller in Kentucky, Tennessee,
Mississippi, and Louisiana than in the older States on the Atlantic
coast.Thus in Louisiana the increase has been from 28,481 to 48,292
farms, or 70 per cent., and in Mississippi from 68,023 to 101,772 farms,
or less than 50 per cent., against 100 in Alabama and Georgia.In
Kentucky the increase has been from 118,422 to 166,453 farms, or 40 per
cent., and in Tennessee from 118,141 to 165,650 farms, or 40 per cent.,
against 60 in Virginia and West Virginia, and 78 in North Carolina.Thus, while the tendency to division is far greater than in the Northern
States of corresponding age, it is found in full force only in six of
the older Southern States, Alabama, West Virginia, and four on the
Atlantic coast.In these, the revolution already effected foreshadows
and will almost certainly bring about important political changes within
a few years.In these six States there 310,795 more farm owners or
occupants than there were ten years ago.--_N.Y.*       *       *       *       *




A FARMER'S LIME KILN.For information about burning lime we republish the following article
furnished by a correspondent of the _Country Gentleman_ several years
ago:

[Illustration: Fig.1), Railway Track--B B B,
Iron Rods running through Kiln--C, Capstone over Arch--D, Arch--E, Well
without brick or ash lining.]I send you a description and sketch of a lime-kiln put up on my premises
about five years ago.The dimensions of this kiln are 13 feet square by
25 feet high from foundation, and its capacity 100 bushels in 24 hours.It was constructed of the limestone quarried on the spot.It has round
iron rods (shown in sketch) passing through, with iron plates fastened
to the ends as clamps to make it more firm; the pair nearest the top
should be not less than 2 feet from that point, the others interspersed
about 2 feet apart--the greatest strain being near the top.The arch
should be 7 feet high by 51/2 wide in front, with a gather on the top
and sides of about 1 foot, with plank floor; and if this has a little
incline it will facilitate shoveling the lime when drawn.The arch
should have a strong capstone; also one immediately under the well of
the kiln, with a hole 2 feet in diameter to draw the lime through; or
two may be used with semicircle cut in each.Iron bars 2 inches wide by
1/8 inch thick are used in this kiln for closing it, working in slots
fastened to capstone.These slots must be put in before the caps
are laid.When it is desired to draw lime, these bars may be
pushed laterally in the slots, or drawn out entirely, according to
circumstances; 3 bars will be enough.The slots are made of iron bars
11/2 inches wide, with ends rounded and turned up, and inserted in holes
drilled through capstone and keyed above.The well of the kiln is lined with fire-brick one course thick, with a
stratum of coal ashes three inches thick tamped in between the brick
and wall, which proves a great protection to the wall.About 2,000
fire-bricks were used.The proprietors of this kiln say about one-half
the lower part of the well might have been lined with a first quality of
common brick and saved some expense and been just as good.The form of
the well shown in Fig.3 is 7 feet in diameter in the bilge, exclusive
of the lining of brick and ashes.Experiments in this vicinity have
proved this to be the best, this contraction toward the top being
absolutely necessary, the expansion of the stone by the heat is so
great that the lime cannot be drawn from perpendicular walls, as was
demonstrated in one instance near here, where a kiln was built on that
principle.The kiln, of course, is for coal, and our stone requires
about three-quarters of a ton per 100 bushels of lime, but this, I am
told, varies according to quality, some requiring more than others; the
quantity can best be determined by experimenting; also the regulation of
the heat--if too great it will cause the stones to melt or run together
as it were, or, if too little, they will not be properly burned.The
business requires skill and judgment to run it successfully.This kiln is located at the foot of a steep bluff, the top about level
with the top of the kiln, with railway track built of wooden sleepers,
with light iron bars, running from the bluff to the top of the kiln, and
a hand-car makes it very convenient filling the kiln.Such a location
should be had if possible.Your inquirer may perhaps get some ideas
of the principles of a kiln for using _coal_.The dimensions may be
reduced, if desired.If for _wood_, the arch would have to be formed for
that, and the height of kiln reduced.*       *       *       *       *




THE MANUFACTURE OF APPLE JELLY.[Footnote: From the report of the New York Agricultural Society.]Within the county of Oswego, New York, Dewitt C. Peck reports there are
five apple jelly factories in operation.The failure of the apple crop,
for some singular and unexplained reason, does not extend in great
degree to the natural or ungrafted fruit.Though not so many as common,
even of these apples, there are yet enough to keep these five mills and
the numerous cider mills pretty well employed.The largest jelly factory
is located near the village of Mexico, and as there are some features in
regard to this manufacture peculiar to this establishment which may be
new and interesting, we will undertake a brief description.The factory
is located on the Salmon Creek, which affords the necessary power.A
portion of the main floor, first story, is occupied as a saw mill,
the slabs furnishing fuel for the boiler furnace connected with the
evaporating department.Just above the mill, along the bank of the pond,
and with one end projecting over the water, are arranged eight large
bins, holding from five hundred to one thousand bushels each, into which
the apples are delivered from the teams.The floor in each of these has
a sharp pitch or inclination toward the water and at the lower end is a
grate through which the fruit is discharged, when wanted, into a trough
half submerged in the pond.The preparation of the fruit and extraction of the juice proceeds
as follows: Upon hoisting a gate in the lower end of this trough,
considerable current is caused, and the water carries the fruit a
distance of from thirty to one hundred feet, and passes into the
basement of the mill, where, tumbling down a four-foot perpendicular
fall, into a tank, tight in its lower half and slatted so as to permit
the escape of water and impurities in the upper half, the apples are
thoroughly cleansed from all earthy or extraneous matter.Such is the
friction caused by the concussion of the fall, the rolling and rubbing
of the apples together, and the pouring of the water, that decayed
sections of the fruit are ground off and the rotten pulp passes away
with other impurities.From this tank the apples are hoisted upon an
endless chain elevator, with buckets in the form of a rake-head with
iron teeth, permitting drainage and escape of water, to an upper story
of the mill, whence by gravity they descend to the grater.The press
is wholly of iron, all its motions, even to the turning of the screws,
being actuated by the water power.The cheese is built up with layers
inclosed in strong cotton cloth, which displaces the straw used in olden
time, and serves also to strain the cider.As it is expressed from
the press tank, the cider passes to a storage tank, and thence to the
defecator.This defecator is a copper pan, eleven feet long and about three feet
wide.At each end of this pan is placed a copper tube three inches in
diameter and closed at both ends.Lying between and connecting
these two, are twelve tubes, also of copper, 11/2 inches in diameter,
penetrating the larger tubes at equal distances from their upper and
under surfaces, the smaller being parallel with each other, and 11/2
inches apart.When placed in position, the larger tubes, which act as
manifolds, supplying the smaller with steam, rest upon the bottom of the
pan, and thus the smaller pipes have a space of three-fourths of an inch
underneath their outer surfaces.The cider comes from the storage tank in a continuous stream about
three-eighths of an inch in diameter.Steam is introduced to the large
or manifold tubes, and from them distributed through the smaller ones at
a pressure of from twenty-five to thirty pounds per inch.Trap valves
are provided for the escape of water formed by condensation within the
pipes.The primary object of the defecator is to remove all impurities
and perfectly clarify the liquid passing through it.All portions of
pomace and other minute particles of foreign matter, when heated,
expand and float in the form of scum upon the surface of the cider.An
ingeniously contrived floating rake drags off this scum and delivers it
over the side of the pan.To facilitate this removal, one side of the
pan, commencing at a point just below the surface of the cider, is
curved gently outward and upward, terminating in a slightly inclined
plane, over the edge of which the scum is pushed by the rake into a
trough and carried away.A secondary purpose served by the defecator
is that of reducing the cider by evaporation to a partial sirup of the
specific gravity of about 20 deg.When of this consistency the liquid
is drawn from the bottom and less agitated portion of the defecator by a
siphon, and thence carried to the evaporator, which is located upon the
same framework and just below the defecator.The evaporator consists of a separate system of six copper tubes, each
twelve feet long and three inches in diameter.These are each jacketed
or inclosed in an iron pipe of four inches internal diameter, fitted
with steam-tight collars so as to leave half an inch steam space
surrounding the copper tubes.The latter are open at both ends
permitting the admission and egress of the sirup and the escape of the
steam caused by evaporation therefrom, and are arranged upon the frame
so as to have a very slight inclination downward in the direction of
the current, and each nearly underneath its predecessor in regular
succession.Each is connected by an iron supply pipe, having a steam
gauge or indicator attached, with a large manifold, and that by other
pipes with a steam boiler of thirty horse power capacity.Steam being
let on at from twenty five to thirty pounds pressure, the stream of
sirup is received from the defecator through a strainer, which removes
any impurities possibly remaining into the upper evaporator tube;
passing in a gentle flow through that, it is delivered into a funnel
connected with the next tube below, and so, back and forth, through the
whole system.The sirup enters the evaporator at a consistency of from
20 deg.Baume, and emerges from the last tube some three minutes
later at a consistency of from 30 deg.Baume, which is found on
cooling to be the proper point for perfect jelly.This point is found to
vary one or two degrees, according to the fermentation consequent upon
bruises in handling the fruit, decay of the same, or any little delay in
expressing the juice from the cheese.The least fermentation occasions
the necessity for a lower reduction.To guard against this, no cheese
is allowed to stand over night, no pomace left in the grater or vat, no
cider in the tank; and further to provide against fermentation, a large
water tank is located upon the roof and filled by a force pump, and by
means of hose connected with this, each grater, press, vat, tank, pipe,
trough, or other article of machinery used, can be thoroughly washed and
cleansed.Hot water, instead of cider, is sometimes sent through the
defecator, evaporator, etc., until all are thoroughly scalded and
purified.If the saccharometer shows too great or too little reduction,
the matter is easily regulated by varying the steam pressure in the
evaporator by means of a valve in the supply pipe.If boiled cider
instead of jelly is wanted for making pies, sauces, etc., it is drawn
off from one of the upper evaporator tubes according to the consistency
desired; or can be produced at the end of the process by simply reducing
the steam pressure.As the jelly emerges from the evaporator it is transferred to a tub
holding some fifty gallons, and by mixing a little therein, any little
variations in reduction or in the sweetness or sourness of the fruit
used are equalized.From this it is drawn through faucets, while hot,
into the various packages in which it is shipped to market.A favorite
form of package for family use is a nicely turned little wooden
bucket with cover and bail, two sizes, holding five and ten pounds
respectively.The smaller packages are shipped in cases for convenience
in handling.The present product of this manufactory is from 1,500 to
1,800 pounds of jelly each day of ten hours.It is calculated that
improvements now in progress will increase this to something more than a
ton per day.Each bushel of fruit will produce from four to five pounds
of jelly, fruit ripening late in the season being more productive than
earlier varieties.Crab apples produce the finest jelly; sour, crabbed,
natural fruit makes the best looking article, and a mixture of all
varieties gives most satisfactory results as to flavor and general
quality.As the pomace is shoveled from the finished cheese, it is again ground
under a toothed cylinder, and thence drops into large troughs, through a
succession of which a considerable stream of water is flowing.Here it
is occasionally agitated by raking from the lower to the upper end of
the trough as the current carries it downward, and the apple seeds
becoming disengaged drop to the bottom into still water, while the pulp
floats away upon the stream.A succession of troughs serves to remove
nearly all the seeds.The value of the apple seeds thus saved is
sufficient to pay the daily wages of all the hands employed in the whole
establishment.The apples are measured in the wagon box, one and a half
cubic feet being accounted a bushel.This mill ordinarily employs about six men: One general superintendent,
who buys and measures the apples, keeps time books, attends to all the
accounts and the working details of the mill, and acts as cashier; one
sawyer, who manufactures lumber for the local market and saws the slabs
into short lengths suitable for the furnace; one cider maker, who grinds
the apples and attends the presses; one jelly maker, who attends the
defecator, evaporator, and mixing tub, besides acting as his own fireman
and engineer; one who attends the apple seed troughs and acts as general
helper, and one man-of-all-work to pack, ship and assist whenever
needed.The establishment was erected late in the season of 1880,
and manufactured that year about forty-five tons of jelly, besides
considerable cider exchanged to the farmers for apples, and some boiled
cider.The price paid for apples in 1880, when the crop was superabundant, was
six to eight cents per bushel; in 1881, fifteen cents.The proprietor
hopes next year to consume 100,000 bushels.These institutions are
important to the farmer in that they use much fruit not otherwise
valuable and very perishable.Fruit so crabbed and gnarled as to have no
market value, and even frozen apples, if delivered while yet solid, can
be used.(Such apples are placed in the water while frozen, the water
draws the frost sufficiently to be grated, and passing through the press
and evaporator before there is time for chemical change, they are found
to make very good jelly.They are valuable to the consumer by converting
the perishable, cheap, almost worthless crop of the bearing and abundant
years into such enduring form that its consumption may be carried over
to years of scarcity and furnish healthful food in cheap and pleasant
form to many who would otherwise be deprived; and lastly, they are of
great interest to society, in that they give to cider twice the value
for purposes of food that it has or can have, even to the manufacturer,
for use as a beverage and intoxicant.*       *       *       *       *




IMPROVED GRAPE BAGS.It stands to reason that were our summers warmer we should be able to
grow grapes successfully on open walls; it is therefore probable that
a new grape bag, the invention of M. Pelletier, 20 Rue de la Banque,
Paris, intended to serve a double purpose, viz., protecting the fruit
and hastening its maturity, will, when it becomes known, be welcomed in
this country.It consists of a square of curved glass so fixed to
the bag that the sun's rays are concentrated upon the fruit, thereby
rendering its ripening more certain in addition to improving its quality
generally.The glass is affixed to the bag by means of a light iron wire
support.It covers that portion of it next the sun, so that it increases
the amount of light and warms the grapes without scorching them, a
result due to the convexity of the glass and the layer of air between it
and the bag.M. Pelletier had the idea of rendering these bags cheaper
by employing plain squares instead of curved ones, but the advantage
thus obtained was more than counterbalanced by their comparative
inefficacy.In practice it was found that the curved squares gave an
average of 7 deg.more than the straight ones, while there was a difference
of 10 deg.when the bags alone were used, thus plainly demonstrating the
practical value of the invention.Whether these glass-fronted bags would have much value in the case of
grapes grown under glass in the ordinary way is a question that can only
be determined by actual experiment; but where the vines are on walls,
either under glass screens or in the open air, so that the bunches feel
the full force of the sun's rays, there can be no doubt as to their
utility, and it is probable that by their aid many of the continental
varieties which we do not now attempt to grow in the open, and which are
scarcely worthy of a place under glass, might be well ripened.At
any rate we ought to give anything a fair trial which may serve to
neutralize, if only in a slight degree, the uncertainty of our summers.As it is, we have only about two varieties of grapes, and these not the
best of the hardy kinds, as regards flavor and appearance, that ripen
out of doors, and even these do not always succeed.We know next to
nothing of the many really well-flavored kinds which are so much
appreciated in many parts of the Continent.The fact is, our outdoor
culture of grapes offers a striking contrast to that practiced under
glass, and although our comparatively sunless and moist climate affords
some excuse for our shortcomings in this respect, there is no valid
reason for the utter want of good culture which is to be observed in a
general way.[Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--OPEN.]Given intelligent training, constant care in stopping the laterals, and
checking mildew as well as thinning the berries, allowing each bunch to
get the full benefit of sun and air, and I believe good eatable grapes
would often be obtained even in summers marked by a low average
temperature.[Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--CLOSED.]If, moreover, to a good system of culture we add some such mechanical
contrivance as that under notice whereby the bunches enjoy an average
warmth some 10 deg.higher than they otherwise would do, we not only insure
the grapes coming to perfection in favored districts, but outdoor
culture might probably be practiced in higher latitudes than is now
practicable.[Illustration: CURVED GLASS FOR FRONT OF BAG.]The improved grape bag would also offer great facilities for destroying
mildew or guarantee the grapes against its attacks, as a light dusting
administered as soon as the berries were fairly formed would suffice for
the season, as owing to the glass protecting the berries from driving
rains, which often accompany south or south-west winds in summer and
autumn, the sulphur would not be washed off.[Illustration: CURVED GLASS FIXED ON BAG.]The inventor claims, and we should say with just reason, that these
glass fronted bags would be found equally serviceable for the ripening
of pears and other choice fruits, and with a view to their being
employed for such a purpose, he has had them made of varying sizes and
shapes.In conclusion, it may be observed that, in addition to advancing
the maturity of the fruits to which they are applied, they also serve to
preserve them from falling to the ground when ripe.--J.COBNHILL, _in
the Garden_.*       *       *       *       *




UTILIZATION OF SOLAR HEAT.At a popular fete in the Tuileries Gardens I was struck with an
experiment which seems deserving of the immediate attention of the
English public and military authorities.Among the attractions of the fete was an apparatus for the concentration
and utilization of solar heat, and, though the sun was not very
brilliant, I saw this apparatus set in motion a printing machine which
printed several thousand copies of a specimen newspaper entitled the
_Soleil Journal_.The sun's rays are concentrated in a reflector, which moves at the
same rate as the sun and heats a vertical boiler, setting the motive
steam-engine at work.As may be supposed, the only object was to
demonstrate the possibility of utilizing the concentrated heat of the
solar rays; but I closely examined it, because the apparatus seems
capable of great utility in existing circumstances.Here in France,
indeed, there is a radical drawback--the sun is often overclouded.Thousands of years ago the idea of utilizing the solar rays must have
suggested itself, and there are still savage tribes who know no other
mode of combustion; but the scientific application has hitherto been
lacking.About fifteen years ago
Professor Mouchon, of Tours, began constructing such an apparatus, and
his experiments have been continued by M. Pifre, who has devoted much
labor and expense to realizing M. Mouchou's idea.A company has now come
to his aid, and has constructed a number of apparatus of different sizes
at a factory which might speedily turn out a large number of them.It is
evident that in a country of uninterrupted sunshine the boiler might be
heated in thirty or forty minutes.A portable apparatus could boil two
and one-half quarts an hour, or, say, four gallons a day, thus supplying
by distillation or ebullition six or eight men.The apparatus can be
easily carried on a man's back, and on condition of water, even of the
worst quality, being obtainable, good drinking and cooking water is
insured.M. De Rougaumond, a young scientific writer, has just published
an interesting volume on the invention.I was able yesterday to verify
his statements, for I saw cider made, a pump set in motion, and coffee
made--in short, the calorific action of the sun superseding that of
fuel.The apparatus, no doubt, has not yet reached perfection, but as it
is it would enable the soldier in India or Egypt to procure in the field
good water and to cook his food rapidly.The invention is of especial
importance to England just now, but even when the Egyptian question is
settled the Indian troops might find it of inestimable value.Red tape should for once be disregarded, and a competent commission
forthwith sent to 30 Rue d'Assas, with instructions to report
immediately, for every minute saved may avoid suffering for Englishmen
fighting abroad for their country.I may, of course, be mistaken, but
a commission would decide, and if the apparatus is good the slightest
delay in its adoption would be deplorable.--_Paris Correspondence London

HOW TO ESTABLISH A TRUE MERIDIAN.[Footnote: A paper read before the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia.]By PROFESSOR L. M. HAUPT.The discovery of the magnetic needle was a boon to mankind, and has been
of inestimable service in guiding the mariner through trackless waters,
and the explorer over desert wastes.In these, its legitimate uses, the
needle has not a rival, but all efforts to apply it to the accurate
determination of permanent boundary lines have proven very
unsatisfactory, and have given rise to much litigation, acerbity, and
even death.For these and other cogent reasons, strenuous efforts are being made to
dispense, so far as practicable, with the use of the magnetic needle
in surveying, and to substitute therefor the more accurate method of
traversing from a true meridian.This method, however, involves a
greater degree of preparation and higher qualifications than are
generally possessed, and unless the matter can be so simplified as to be
readily understood, it is unreasonable to expect its general application
in practice.Much has been written upon the various methods of determining, the
true meridian, but it is so intimately related to the determination of
latitude and time, and these latter in turn upon the fixing of a true
meridian, that the novice can find neither beginning nor end.When to
these difficulties are added the corrections for parallax, refraction,
instrumental errors, personal equation, and the determination of the
probable error, he is hopelessly confused, and when he learns that time
may be sidereal, mean solar, local, Greenwich, or Washington, and he is
referred to an ephemeris and table of logarithms for data, he becomes
lost in "confusion worse confounded," and gives up in despair, settling
down to the conviction that the simple method of compass surveying is
the best after all, even if not the most accurate.Having received numerous requests for information upon the subject, I
have thought it expedient to endeavor to prepare a description of the
method of determining the true meridian which should be sufficiently
clear and practical to be generally understood by those desiring to make
use of such information.This will involve an elementary treatment of the subject, beginning with
the


DEFINITIONS.The _celestial sphere_ is that imaginary surface upon which all
celestial objects are projected.The _earth's axis_ is the imaginary line about which it revolves.The _poles_ are the points in which the axis pierces the surface of the
earth, or of the celestial sphere.A _meridian_ is a great circle of the earth cut out by a plane passing
through the axis.All meridians are therefore north and south lines
passing through the poles.From these definitions it follows that if there were a star exactly at
the pole it would only be necessary to set up an instrument and take a
bearing to it for the meridian.Such not being the case, however, we are
obliged to take some one of the near circumpolar stars as our object,
and correct the observation according to its angular distance from the
meridian at the time of observation.For convenience, the bright star known as Ursae Minoris or Polaris, is
generally selected.This star apparently revolves about the north pole,
in an orbit whose mean radius is 1 deg.19' 13",[1] making the revolution in
23 hours 56 minutes.[Footnote 1: This is the codeclination as given in the Nautical Almanac.The mean value decreases by about 20 seconds each year.]During this time it must therefore cross the meridian twice, once above
the pole and once below; the former is called the _upper_, and the
latter the _lower meridian transit or culmination_.It must also pass
through the points farthest east and west from the meridian.The former
is called the _eastern elongation_, the latter the _western_.An observation may he made upon Polaris at any of these four points,
or at any other point of its orbit, but this latter case becomes too
complicated for ordinary practice, and is therefore not considered.If the observation were made upon the star at the time of its upper or
lower culmination, it would give the true meridian at once, but this
involves a knowledge of the true local time of transit, or the longitude
of the place of observation, which is generally an unknown quantity; and
moreover, as the star is then moving east or west, or at right angles to
the place of the meridian, at the rate of 15 deg.of arc in about one hour,
an error of so slight a quantity as only four seconds of time would
introduce an error of one minute of arc.If the observation be made,
however, upon either elongation, when the star is moving up or down,
that is, in the direction of the vertical wire of the instrument, the
error of observation in the angle between it and the pole will be
inappreciable.This is, therefore, the best position upon which to make
the observation, as the precise time of the elongation need not be
given.It can be determined with sufficient accuracy by a glance at the
relative positions of the star Alioth, in the handle of the Dipper,
and Polaris (see Fig.When the line joining these two stars is
horizontal or nearly so, and Alioth is to the _west_ of Polaris, the
latter is at its _eastern_ elongation, and _vice versa_, thus:

[Illustration]

But since the star at either elongation is off the meridian, it will
be necessary to determine the angle at the place of observation to be
turned off on the instrument to bring it into the meridian.This angle,
called the azimuth of the pole star, varies with the latitude of the
observer, as will appear from Fig 2, and hence its value must be
computed for different latitudes, and the surveyor must know his
_latitude_ before he can apply it.Let N be the north pole of the
celestial sphere; S, the position of Polaris at its eastern elongation;
then N S=1 deg.The azimuth of Polaris at the
latitude 40 deg.north is represented by the angle N O S, and that at 60 deg.north, by the angle N O' S, which is greater, being an exterior angle
of the triangle, O S O. From this we see that the azimuth varies at the
latitude.We have first, then, to _find the latitude of the place of observation_.Of the several methods for doing this, we shall select the simplest,
preceding it by a few definitions.A _normal_ line is the one joining the point directly overhead, called
the _zenith_, with the one under foot called the _nadir_.The _celestial horizon_ is the intersection of the celestial sphere by a
plane passing through the center of the earth and perpendicular to the
normal.A _vertical circle_ is one whose plane is perpendicular to the horizon,
hence all such circles must pass through the normal and have the zenith
and nadir points for their poles.The _altitude_ of a celestial object
is its distance above the horizon measured on the arc of a vertical
circle.As the distance from the horizon to the zenith is 90 deg., the
difference, or _complement_ of the altitude, is called the _zenith
distance_, or _co-altitude_.The _azimuth_ of an object is the angle between the vertical plane
through the object and the plane of the meridian, measured on the
horizon, and usually read from the south point, as 0 deg., through west, at
90, north 180 deg., etc., closing on south at 0 deg.These two co-ordinates, the altitude and azimuth, will determine the
position of any object with reference to the observer's place.The
latter's position is usually given by his latitude and longitude
referred to the equator and some standard meridian as co-ordinates.The _latitude_ being the angular distance north or south of the equator,
and the _longitude_ east or west of the assumed meridian.We are now prepared to prove that _the altitude of the pole is equal to
the latitude of the place of observation_.Let H P Z Q1, etc., Fig.2, represent a meridian section of the sphere,
in which P is the north pole and Z the place of observation, then H H1
will be the horizon, Q Q1 the equator, H P will be the altitude of P,
and Q1 Z the latitude of Z. These two arcs are equal, for H C Z = P C
Q1 = 90 deg., and if from these equal quadrants the common angle P C Z be
subtracted, the remainders H C P and Z C Q1, will be equal.To _determine the altitude of the pole_, or, in other words, _the
latitude of the place_.Observe the altitude of the pole star _when on the meridian_, either
above or below the pole, and from this observed altitude corrected for
refraction, subtract the distance of the star from the pole, or its
_polar distance_, if it was an upper transit, or add it if a lower.The result will be the required latitude with sufficient accuracy for
ordinary purposes.The time of the star's being on the meridian can be determined with
sufficient accuracy by a mere inspection of the heavens.The refraction
is _always negative_, and may be taken from the table appended by
looking up the amount set opposite the observed altitude.Thus, if the
observer's altitude should be 40 deg.39' the nearest refraction 01' 07",
should be subtracted from 40 deg.37' 53" for the
latitude.TO FIND THE AZIMUTH OF POLARIS.As we have shown the azimuth of Polaris to be a function of the
latitude, and as the latitude is now known, we may proceed to find the
required azimuth.For this purpose we have a right-angled spherical
triangle, Z S P, Fig.4, in which Z is the place of observation, P the
north pole, and S is Polaris.In this triangle we have given the polar
distance, P S = 10 deg.19' 13"; the angle at S = 90 deg.; and the distance Z
P, being the complement of the latitude as found above, or 90 deg.--L.Substituting these in the formula for the azimuth, we will have sin.of co-latitude, from
which, by assuming different values for the co-latitude, we compute the
following table:

An analysis of this table shows that the azimuth this year (1882)
increases with the latitude from 1 deg.It also shows that the azimuth of Polaris at
any one point of observation decreases slightly from year to year.This
is due to the increase in declination, or decrease in the star's polar
distance.north latitude, this annual decrease in the azimuth
is about 22", while at 50 deg.As the variation in
azimuth for each degree of latitude is small, the table is only computed
for the even numbered degrees; the intermediate values being readily
obtained by interpolation.We see also that an error of a few minutes of
latitude will not affect the result in finding the meridian, e.g., the
azimuth at 40 deg.44'
56", the difference (01' 35") being the correction for one degree of
latitude between 40 deg.Or, in other words, an error of one degree
in finding one's latitude would only introduce an error in the azimuth
of one and a half minutes.With ordinary care the probable error of the
latitude as determined from the method already described need not exceed
a few minutes, making the error in azimuth as laid off on the arc of an
ordinary transit graduated to single minutes, practically zero.REFRACTION TABLE FOR ANY ALTITUDE WITHIN THE LATITUDE OF THE UNITED

APPLICATIONS.In practice to find the true meridian, two observations must be made at
intervals of six hours, or they may be made upon different nights.The
first is for latitude, the second for azimuth at elongation.To make either, the surveyor should provide himself with a good transit
with vertical arc, a bull's eye, or hand lantern, plumb bobs, stakes,
etc.[1] Having "set up" over the point through which it is proposed to
establish the meridian, at a time when the line joining Polaris and
Alioth is nearly vertical, level the telescope by means of the attached
level, which should be in adjustment, set the vernier of the vertical
arc at zero, and take the reading.If the pole star is about making its
_upper_ transit, it will rise gradually until reaching the meridian as
it moves westward, and then as gradually descend.When near the highest
part of its orbit point the telescope at the star, having an assistant
to hold the "bull's eye" so as to reflect enough light down the tube
from the object end to illumine the cross wires but not to obscure the
star, or better, use a perforated silvered reflector, clamp the tube in
this position, and as the star continues to rise keep the _horizontal_
wire upon it by means of the tangent screw until it "rides" along this
wire and finally begins to fall below it.Take the reading of the
vertical arc and the result will be the observed altitude.[Footnote 1: A sextant and artificial horizon may be used to find the
_altitude_ of a star.In this case the observed angle must be divided by
2.]It is a little more accurate to find the altitude by taking the
complement of the observed zenith distance, if the vertical arc has
sufficient range.This is done by pointing first to Polaris when at
its highest (or lowest) point, reading the vertical arc, turning the
horizontal limb half way around, and the telescope over to get another
reading on the star, when the difference of the two readings will be the
_double_ zenith distance, and _half_ of this subtracted from 90 deg.The less the time intervening between these two
pointings, the more accurate the result will be.Having now found the altitude, correct it for refraction by subtracting
from it the amount opposite the observed altitude, as given in the
refraction table, and the result will be the latitude.The observer must
now wait about six hours until the star is at its western elongation,
or may postpone further operations for some subsequent night.In the
meantime he will take from the azimuth table the amount given for his
date and latitude, now determined, and if his observation is to be made
on the western elongation, he may turn it off on his instrument, so
that when moved to zero, _after_ the observation, the telescope will be
brought into the meridian or turned to the right, and a stake set by
means of a lantern or plummet lamp.[Illustration]

It is, of course, unnecessary to make this correction at the time of
observation, for the angle between any terrestrial object and the star
may be read and the correction for the azimuth of the star applied at
the surveyor's convenience.It is always well to check the accuracy of
the work by an observation upon the other elongation before putting in
permanent meridian marks, and care should be taken that they are not
placed near any local attractions.The meridian having been established,
the magnetic variation or declination may readily be found by setting
an instrument on the meridian and noting its bearing as given by the
needle.If, for example, it should be north 5 deg._east_, the variation is
west, because the north end of the needle is _west_ of the meridian, and
_vice versa_._Local time_ may also be readily found by observing the instant when the
sun's center[1] crosses the line, and correcting it for the equation of
time as given above--the result is the true or mean solar time.This,
compared with the clock, will show the error of the latter, and by
taking the difference between the local lime of this and any other
place, the difference of longitude is determined in hours, which can
readily be reduced to degrees by multiplying by fifteen, as 1 h.[Footnote 1: To obtain this time by observation, note the instant of
first contact of the sun's limb, and also of last contact of same, and
take the mean.]APPROXIMATE EQUATION OF TIME._______________________

THE OCELLATED PHEASANT.The collections of the Museum of Natural History of Paris have just been
enriched with a magnificent, perfectly adult specimen of a species of
bird that all the scientific establishments had put down among their
desiderata, and which, for twenty years past, has excited the curiosity
of naturalists.This species, in fact, was known only by a few caudal
feathers, of which even the origin was unknown, and which figured in the
galleries of the Jardin des Plantes under the name of _Argus ocellatus_.This name was given by J. Verreaux, who was then assistant naturalist at
the museum.L. Bonaparte, in his Tableaux
Paralleliques de l'Ordre des Gallinaces, as _Argus giganteus_, and a
few years later it was reproduced by Slater in his Catalogue of the
Phasianidae, and by Gray is his List of the Gallinaceae.But it was not
till 1871 and 1872 that Elliot, in the Annals and Magazine of Natural
History, and in a splendid monograph of the Phasianidae, pointed out
the peculiarities that were presented by the feathers preserved at the
Museum of Paris, and published a figure of them of the natural size.The discovery of an individual whose state of preservation leaves
nothing to be desired now comes to demonstrate the correctness of
Verreaux's, Bonaparte's, and Elliot's suppositions.This bird, whose
tail is furnished with feathers absolutely identical with those that
the museum possessed, is not a peacock, as some have asserted, nor an
ordinary Argus of Malacca, nor an argus of the race that Elliot named
_Argus grayi_, and which inhabits Borneo, but the type of a new genus of
the family Phasianidae.This Gallinacean, in fact, which Mr.Maingonnat
has given up to the Museum of Natural History, has not, like the common
Argus of Borneo, excessively elongated secondaries; and its tail is not
formed of normal rectrices, from the middle of which spring two very
long feathers, a little curved and arranged like a roof; but it consists
of twelve wide plane feathers, regularly tapering, and ornamented with
ocellated spots, arranged along the shaft.Its head is not bare, but is
adorned behind with a tuft of thread-like feathers; and, finally, its
system of coloration and the proportions of the different parts of its
body are not the same as in the common argus of Borneo.There is reason,
then, for placing the bird, under the name of _Rheinardius ocellatus_,
in the family Phasianidae, after the genus _Argus_ which it connects,
after a manner, with the pheasants properly so-called.The specific name
_ocellatus_ has belonged to it since 1871, and must be substituted for
that of _Rheinardi_.The bird measures more than two meters in length, three-fourths of which
belong to the tail.The head, which is relatively small, appears to be
larger than it really is, owing to the development of the piliform tuft
on the occiput, this being capable of erection so as to form a crest
0.05 to 0.06 of a meter in height.The feathers of this crest are
brown and white.The back and sides of the head are covered with downy
feathers of a silky brown and silvery gray, and the front of the neck
with piliform feathers of a ruddy brown.The upper part of the body is
of a blackish tint and the under part of a reddish brown, the whole
dotted with small white or _cafe-au-lait_ spots.Analogous spots are
found on the wings and tail, but on the secondaries these become
elongated, and tear-like in form.On the remiges the markings are quite
regularly hexagonal in shape; and on the upper coverts of the tail
and on the rectrices they are accompanied with numerous ferruginous
blotches, some of which are irregularly scattered over the whole surface
of the vane, while others, marked in the center with a blackish spot,
are disposed in series along the shaft and resemble ocelli.This
similitude of marking between the rectrices and subcaudals renders the
distinction between these two kinds of feathers less sharp than in many
other Gallinaceans, and the more so in that two median rectrices are
considerably elongated and assume exactly the aspect of tail feathers.[Illustration: THE OCELLATED PHEASANT (_Rheinardius ocellatus_).]They are all absolutely plane,
all spread out horizontally, and they go on increasing in length
from the exterior to the middle.They are quite wide at the point of
insertion, increase in diameter at the middle, and afterward taper to
a sharp point.Altogether they form a tail of extraordinary length and
width which the bird holds slightly elevated, so as to cause it to
describe a graceful curve, and the point of which touches the soil.The
beak, whose upper mandible is less arched than that of the pheasants,
exactly resembles that of the arguses.It is slightly inflated at the
base, above the nostrils, and these latter are of an elongated-oval
form.In the bird that I have before me the beak, as well as the feet
and legs, is of a dark rose-color.The legs are quite long and are
destitute of spurs.They terminate in front in three quite delicate
toes, connected at the base by membranes, and behind in a thumb that is
inserted so high that it scarcely touches the ground in walking.This
magnificent bird was captured in a portion of Tonkin as yet unexplored
by Europeans, in a locality named Buih-Dinh, 400 kilometers to the south
of Hue.--_La Nature_.*       *       *       *       *




THE MAIDENHAIR TREE.The Maidenhair tree--Gingkgo biloba--of which we give an illustration,
is not only one of our most ornamental deciduous trees, but one of the
most interesting.Few persons would at first sight take it to be a
Conifer, more especially as it is destitute of resin; nevertheless,
to that group it belongs, being closely allied to the Yew, but
distinguishable by its long-stalked, fan-shaped leaves, with numerous
radiating veins, as in an Adiantum.These leaves, like those of the
larch but unlike most Conifers, are deciduous, turning of a pale yellow
color before they fall.The tree is found in Japan and in China, but
generally in the neighborhood of temples or other buildings, and is, we
believe, unknown in a truly wild state.As in the case of several other
trees planted in like situations, such as Cupressus funebris, Abies
fortunei, A. kaempferi, Cryptomeria japonica, Sciadopitys verticillata,
it is probable that the trees have been introduced from Thibet, or
other unexplored districts, into China and Japan.Though now a solitary
representative of its genus, the Gingkgo was well represented in the
coal period, and also existed through the secondary and tertiary epochs,
Professor Heer having identified kindred specimens belonging to sixty
species and eight genera in fossil remains generally distributed through
the northern hemisphere.Whatever inference we may draw, it is at least
certain that the tree was well represented in former times, if now it
be the last of its race.It was first known to Kaempfer in 1690, and
described by him in 1712, and was introduced into this country in the
middle of the eighteenth century.Loudon relates a curious tale as
to the manner in which a French amateur became possessed of it.The
Frenchman, it appears, came to England, and paid a visit to an English
nurseryman, who was the possessor of five plants, raised from Japanese
seeds.The hospitable Englishman entertained the Frenchman only too
well.He allowed his commercial instincts to be blunted by wine, and
sold to his guest the five plants for the sum of 25 guineas.Next
morning, when time for reflection came, the Englishman attempted to
regain one only of the plants for the same sum that the Frenchman had
given for all five, but without avail.The plants were conveyed to
France, where as each plant had cost about 40 crowns, _ecus_, the tree
got the name of _arbre a quarante ecus_.This is the story as given by
Loudon, who tells us that Andre Thouin used to relate the fact in his
lectures at the Jardin des Plantes, whether as an illustration of the
perfidy of Albion is not stated.The tree is dioecious, bearing male catkins on one plant, female on
another.All the female trees in Europe are believed to have originated
from a tree near Geneva, of which Auguste Pyramus de Candolle secured
grafts, and distributed them throughout the Continent.Nevertheless, the
female tree is rarely met with, as compared with the male; but it is
quite possible that a tree which generally produces male flowers only
may sometimes bear female flowers only.We have no certain evidence of
this in the case of the Gingkgo, but it is a common enough occurrence in
other dioecious plants, and the occurrence of a fruiting specimen near
Philadelphia, as recently recorded by Mr.Meehan, may possibly be
attributed to this cause.The tree of which we give a figure is growing at Broadlands, Hants, and
is about 40 feet in height, with a trunk that measures 7 feet in girth
at 3 feet from the ground, with a spread of branches measuring 45 feet.These dimensions have been considerably exceeded in other cases.In 1837
a tree at Purser's Cross measured 60 feet and more in height.Loudon
himself had a small tree in his garden at Bayswater on which a female
branch was grafted.It is to be feared that this specimen has long since
perished.We have already alluded to its deciduous character, in which it is
allied to the larch.It presents another point of resemblance both to
the larch and the cedar in the short spurs upon which both leaves and
male catkins are borne, but these contracted branches are mingled with
long extension shoots; there seems, however, no regular alternation
between the short and the long shoots, at any rate the _rationale_ of
their production is not understood, though in all probability a little
observation of the growing plant would soon clear the matter up.The fruit is drupaceous, with a soft outer coat and a hard woody shell,
greatly resembling that of a Cycad, both externally and internally.Whether the albumen contains the peculiar "corpuscles" common to Cycads
and Conifers, we do not for certain know, though from the presence of 2
to 3 embryos in one seed, as noted by Endlicher, we presume this is the
case.The interest of these corpuscles, it may be added, lies in the
proof of affinity they offer between Conifers and the higher Cryptogams,
such as ferns and lycopods--an affinity shown also in the peculiar
venation of the Gingkgo.Conifers are in some degree links between
ordinary flowering plants and the higher Cryptogams, and serve to
connect in genealogical sequence groups once considered quite distinct.In germination the two fleshy cotyledons of the Gingkgo remain within
the shell, leaving the three-sided plumule to pass upward; the young
stem bears its leaves in threes.We have no desire to enter further upon the botanical peculiarities of
this tree; enough if we have indicated in what its peculiar interest
consists.We have only to add that in gardens varieties exist some with
leaves more deeply cut than usual, others with leaves nearly entire, and
others with leaves of a golden-yellow color.--_Gardeners' Chronicle_.[Illustration: THE MAIDENHAIR TREE IN THE GARDENS AT BROADLANDS.]*       *       *       *       *




THE WOODS OF AMERICA.A collection of woods without a parallel in the world is now being
prepared for exhibition by the Directors of the American Museum of
Natural History.Scattered about the third floor of the Arsenal, in
Central Park, lie 394 logs, some carefully wrapped in bagging,
some inclosed in rough wooden cases, and others partially sawn
longitudinally, horizontally, and diagonally.These logs represent all
but 26 of the varieties of trees indigenous to this country, and
nearly all have a greater or less economic or commercial value.The 26
varieties needed to complete the collection will arrive before winter
sets in, a number of specimens being now on their way to this city from
the groves of California.S. D. Dill and a number of assistants are
engaged in preparing the specimens for exhibition.The logs as they
reach the workroom are wrapped in bagging and inclosed in cases, this
method being used so that the bark, with its growth of lichens and
delicate exfoliations, shall not be injured while the logs are in
process of transportation from various parts of the country to this
city.The logs are each 6 feet in length, and each is the most perfect
specimen of its class that could be found by the experts employed in
making the collection.With the specimens of the trees come to the
museum also specimens of the foliage and the fruits and flowers of the
tree.These come from all parts of the Union--from Alaska on the north
to Texas on the south, from Maine on the east to California on the
west--and there is not a State or Territory in the Union which has not a
representative in this collection of logs.On arrival here the logs are
green, and the first thing in the way of treatment after their arrival
is to season them, a work requiring great care to prevent them from
"checking," as it is technically called, or "season cracking," as the
unscientific term the splitting of the wood in radiating lines during
the seasoning process.As is well known, the sap-wood of a tree seasons
much more quickly than does the heart of the wood.The prevention of
this splitting is very necessary in preparing these specimens for
exhibition, for when once the wood has split its value for dressing for
exhibition is gone.A new plan to prevent this destruction of specimens
is now being tried with some success under the direction of Prof.Into the base of the log and
alongside the heart a deep hole is bored with an auger.As the wood
seasons this hole permits of a pressure inward and so has in many
instances doubtless saved valuable specimens.One of the finest in the
collection, a specimen of the persimmon tree, some two feet in diameter,
has been ruined by the seasoning process.On one side there is a huge
crack, extending from the top to the bottom of the log, which looks as
though some amateur woodman had attempted to split it with an ax and
had made a poor job of it.The great shrinking of the sap-wood of the
persimmon tree makes the wood of but trifling value commercially.It also has a discouraging effect upon collectors, as it is next to
impossible to cure a specimen, so that all but this one characteristic
of the wood can be shown to the public in a perfect form.Before the logs become thoroughly seasoned, or their lines of growth at
all obliterated, a diagram of each is made, showing in accordance with
a regular scale the thickness of the bark, the sap-wood, and the heart.There is also in this diagram a scale showing the growth of the tree
during each year of its life, these yearly growths being regularly
marked about the heart of the tree by move or less regular concentric
circles, the width of which grows smaller and smaller as the tree grows
older.In this connection attention may be called to a specimen in the
collection which is considered one of the most remarkable in the world.It is not a native wood, but an importation, and the tree from which
this wonderful slab is cut is commonly known as the "Pride of India."The heart of this particular tree was on the port side, and between it
and the bark there is very little sap-wood, not more than an inch.On the starbord side, so to speak, the sap-wood has grown out in an
abnormal manner, and one of the lines indicative of a year's growth is
one and seven-eighths inches in width, the widest growth, many experts
who have seen the specimen say, that was ever recorded.The diagrams
referred to are to be kept for scientific uses, and the scheme of
exhibition includes these diagrams as a part of the whole.After a log has become seasoned it is carefully sawed through the center
down about one-third of its length.A transverse cut is then made and
the semi-cylindrical section thus severed from the log is removed.The
upper end is then beveled.When a log is thus treated the inspector can
see the lower two-thirds presenting exactly the same appearance it did
when growing in the forest.The horizontal cut, through the sap-wood
and to the center of the heart, shows the life lines of the tree, and
carefully planed as are this portion, the perpendicular and the beveled
sections, the grain of the wood can thus be plainly seen.That these may
be made even more valuable to the architect and artisan, the right half
of this planed surface will be carefully polished, and the left half
left in the natural state.This portion of the scheme of treatment is
entirely in the interests of architects and artisans, and it is expected
by Prof.Bickmore that it will be the means of securing for some kinds
of trees, essentially of American growth, and which have been virtually
neglected, an important place in architecture and in ornamental
wood-work, and so give a commercial value to woods that are now of
comparatively little value.Among the many curious specimens in the collection now being prepared
for exhibition, one which will excite the greatest curiosity is a
specimen of the honey locust, which was brought here from Missouri.The bark is covered with a growth of thorns from one to four inches
in length, sharp as needles, and growing at irregular intervals.The
specimen arrived here in perfect condition, but, in order that it might
be transported without injury, it had to be suspended from the roof of
a box car, and thus make its trip from Southern Missouri to this city
without change.Another strange specimen in the novel collection is a
portion of the Yucca tree, an abnormal growth of the lily family.The
trunk, about 2 feet in diameter, is a spongy mass, not susceptible of
treatment to which the other specimens are subjected.Its bark is an
irregular stringy, knotted mass, with porcupine-quill-like leaves
springing out in place of the limbs that grow from all well-regulated
trees.One specimen of the yucca was sent to the museum two years ago,
and though the roots and top of the tree were sawn off, shoots sprang
out, and a number of the handsome flowers appeared.The tree was
supposed to be dead and thoroughly seasoned by this Fall, but now, when
the workmen are ready to prepare it for exhibition, it has shown new
life, new shoots have appeared, and two tufts of green now decorate the
otherwise dry and withered log, and the yucca promises to bloom again
before the winter is over.One of the most perfect specimens of the
Douglass spruce ever seen is in the collection, and is a decided
curiosity.It is a recent arrival from the Rocky Mountains.Its bark,
two inches or more in thickness, is perforated with holes reaching to
the-sap-wood.Many of these contain acorns, or the remains of acorns,
which have been stored there by provident woodpeckers, who dug the holes
in the bark and there stored their winter supply of food.The oldest
specimen in the collection is a section of the _Picea engelmanni_, a
species of spruce growing in the Rocky Mountains at a considerable
elevation above the sea.The specimen is 24 inches in diameter, and the
concentric circles show its age to be 410 years.The wood much resembles
the black spruce, and is the most valuable of the Rocky Mountain
growths.A specimen of the nut pine, whose nuts are used for food by the
Indians, is only 15 inches in diameter, and yet its life lines show its
age to be 369 years.The largest specimen yet received is a section of
the white ash, which is 46 inches in diameter and 182 years old.The
next largest specimen is a section of the _Platanus occidentalis_,
variously known in commerce as the sycamore, button-wood, or plane tree,
which is 42 inches in diameter and only 171 years of age.Specimens of
the redwood tree of California are now on their way to this city from
the Yosemite Valley.One specimen, though a small one, measures 5 feet
in diameter and shows the character of the wood.A specimen of
the enormous growths of this tree was not secured because of the
impossibility of transportation and the fact that there would be no room
in the museum for the storage of such a specimen, for the diameter of
the largest tree of the class is 45 feet and 8 inches, which represents
a circumference of about 110 feet.Then, too, the Californians object to
have the giant trees cut down for commercial, scientific, or any other
purposes.To accompany these specimens of the woods of America, Mr.Morris K.
Jesup, who has paid all the expense incurred in the collection of
specimens, is having prepared as an accompanying portion of the
exhibition water color drawings representing the actual size, color,
and appearance of the fruit, foliage, and flowers of the various trees.Their commercial products, as far as they can be obtained, will also be
exhibited, as, for instance, in the case of the long-leaved pine, the
tar, resin, and pitch, for which it is especially valued.Then, too, in
an herbarium the fruits, leaves, and flowers are preserved as nearly as
possible in their natural state.When the collection is ready for public
view next spring it will be not only the largest, but the only complete
one of its kind in the country.There is nothing like it in the world,
as far as is known; certainly not in the royal museums of England,
France, or Germany.Aside from the value of the collection, in a scientific way, it is
proposed to make it an adjunct to our educational system, which requires
that teachers shall instruct pupils as to the materials used for food
and clothing.The completeness of the exhibition will be of great
assistance also to landscape gardeners, as it will enable them to lay
out private and public parks so that the most striking effects of
foliage may be secured.The beauty of these effects can best be seen in
this country in our own Central Park, where there are more different
varieties and more combinations for foliage effects than in any other
area in the United States.To ascertain how these effects are obtained
one now has to go to much trouble to learn the names of the trees.With
this exhibition such information can be had merely by observation, for
the botanical and common names of each specimen will be attached to
it.It will also be of practical use in teaching the forester how to
cultivate trees as he would other crops.The rapid disappearance of
many valuable forest trees, with the increase in demand and decrease in
supply, will tend to make the collection valuable as a curiosity in
the not far distant future as representing the extinct trees of the
country.--_N.Y.*       *       *       *       *

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Scientific American Supplement No.It is too
early in the history of the world to write a creed.Our fathers were
intellectual slaves; our fathers were intellectual serfs.There never
has been a free generation on the globe.Every creed you have got bears
the mark of whip, and chain, and fagot.There has been no creed written by a free brain.Wait until we have had
two or three generations of liberty and it will then be time enough to
seize the swift horse of progress by the bridle and say--thus far and
no farther; and in the meantime let us be kind to each other; let us be
decent towards each other.We are all travelers on the great plain we
call life, and there is nobody quite sure what road to take--not just
dead sure, you know.There are lots of guide-boards on the plain and you
find thousands of people swearing to-day that their guide-board is the
only board that shows the right direction.I go and talk to them and
they say: "You go that way, or you will be damned."I go to another and
they say: "You go this way, or you will be damned."Every Mind True to Itself

In my judgment, every human being should take a road of his own.Every
mind should be true to itself--should think, investigate and conclude
for itself.This is a duty alike incumbent upon pauper and prince.In every age some men carried the torch of progress and handed it
to some other, and it has been carried through all the dark ages of
barbarism, and had it not been for such men we would have been naked
and uncivilized to-night, with pictures of wild beasts tattooed on our
skins, dancing around some dried snake fetish.Gold makes a Barren Landscape

Only a few days ago I was where they wrench the precious metals from
the miserly clutch of the rocks.When I saw the mountains; treeless,
shrubless, flowerless, without even a spire of grass, it seemed to me
that gold had the same effect upon the country that holds it, as upon
the man who lives and labors only for it.It affects the land as it
does the man.It leaves the heart barren without a flower of
kindness--without a blossom of pity.A Grand Achievement

There is nothing grander than to rescue from the leprosy of slander the
reputation of a great and generous name.There is nothing nobler than to
benefit our benefactors.The Divorce of Church and State

The Constitution of the United States was the first decree entered in
the high court of a nation, forever divorcing Church and State.Professors

Instead of dismissing professors for finding something out, let us
rather discharge those who do not.Let each teacher understand that
investigation is not dangerous for him; that his bread is safe, no
matter how much truth he may discover, and that his salary will not be
reduced, simply because he finds that the ancient Jews did not know the
entire history of the world.Developement

I thought after all I had rather belong to a race of people that came
from skulless vertebrae in the dim Laurentian period, that wiggled
without knowing they were wiggling, that began to develope and came up
by a gradual developement until they struck this gentleman in the dugout
coming up slowly--up--up--up--until, for instance, they produced such a
man as Shakespeare--he who harvested all the fields of dramatic thought,
and after whom all others have been only gleaners of straw, he who found
the human intellect dwelling in a hut, touched it with the wand of his
genius and it became a palace--producing him and hundreds of others I
might mention--with the angels of progress leaning over the far horizon
beckoning this race of work and thought--I had rather belong to a race
commencing at the skulless vertebrae producing the gentleman in the
dugout and so on up, than to have descended from a perfect pair, upon
which the Lord has lost money from that day to this.I had rather belong
to a race that is going up than to one that is going down.I would
rather belong to one that commenced at the skulless vertebrae and
started for perfection, than to belong to one that started from
perfection and started for the skulless vertebrae.Poet's Dream

When every church becomes a school, every cathedral a university, every
clergyman a teacher, and all their hearers brave and honest
thinkers, then, and not until then, will the dream of poet, patriot,
philanthropist and philosopher, become a real and blessed truth.The Temple of the Future

We are laying the foundations of the grand temple of the future--not the
temple of all the gods, but of all the people--wherein, with appropriate
rites, will be celebrated the religion of Humanity.We are doing what
little we can to hasten the coming of the day when society shall cease
producing millionaires and mendicants--gorged indolence and famished
industry--truth in rags, and superstition robed and crowned.We are
looking for the time when the useful shall be the honorable; and when
Reason, throned upon the world's brain, shall be the King of Kings, and
God of Gods.The final Goal

We do not expect to accomplish everything in our day; but we want to
do what good we can, and to render all the service possible in the
holy cause of human progress.We know that doing away with gods and
supernatural persons and powers is not an end.It is a means to the end;
the real end being the happiness of man.The Eighteenth Century

At that time the seeds sown by the great Infidels were beginning to
bear fruit in France.The Eighteenth
Century was crowning its gray hairs with the wreath of Progress.On
every hand Science was bearing testimony against the Church.Voltaire
had filled Europe with light; D'Holbach was giving to the _elite_
of Paris the principles contained in his "System of Nature."The
Encyclopedists had attacked superstition with information for the
masses.A few had the
courage to keep their shoes on and let the bush burn.America had set an
example to the world.The word Liberty was in the mouths of men, and
they began to wipe the dust from their knees.The dawn of a new day had
appeared.POLITICAL QUESTIONS




63.Ours is the only flag that
has in reality written upon it: Liberty, Fraternity, Equality--the three
grandest words in all the languages of men.Liberty: Give to every man
the fruit of his own labor--the labor of his hand and of his brain.Fraternity: Every man in the right is my brother.Equality: The rights
of all are equal.No race, no color, no previous condition, can change
the rights of men.The Declaration of Independence has at last been
carried out in letter and in spirit.To-day the black man looks upon his
child and says: The avenues of distinction are open to you--upon your
brow may fall the civic wreath.We are celebrating the courage and
wisdom of our fathers, and the glad shout of a free people, the anthem
of a grand nation, commencing at the Atlantic, is following the sun to
the Pacific, across a continent of happy homes.Is it
nothing to fill the world with light, with discovery, with science?Is it nothing to dignify man and exalt the intellect?Is it nothing to
grope your way into the dreary prisons, the damp and dropping dungeons,
the dark and silent cells of superstition, where the souls of men
are chained to floors of stone?Is it nothing to conduct these souls
gradually into the blessed light of day,--to let them see again the
happy fields, the sweet, green earth, and hear the everlasting music of
the waves?Is it nothing to make men wipe the dust from their swollen
knees, the tears from their blanched and furrowed cheeks?Is it nothing
to relieve the heavens of an insatiate monster, and write upon the
eternal dome, glittering with stars, the grand word--Liberty?Ingersoll Not a Politician

I want it perfectly understood that I am not a politician.I believe in
liberty, and I want to see the time when every man, woman and child will
enjoy every human right.Civilization

Civilization is the child of free thought.The new world has drifted
away from the rotten wharf of superstition.The politics of this country
are being settled by the new ideas of individual liberty, and parties
and churches that cannot accept the new truths must perish.Cornell University

With the single exception of Cornell, there is not a college in the
United States where truth has ever been a welcome guest.The moment one
of the teachers denies the inspiration of the Bible, he is discharged.If he discovers a fact inconsistent with that book, so much the worse
for the fact, and especially for the discoverer of the fact.He must not
corrupt the minds of his pupils with demonstrations.He must beware
of every truth that cannot, in some way, be made to harmonize with the
superstitions of the Jews.Church and School Divorced

Our country will never be filled with great institutions of learning
until there is an absolute divorce between church and school.As long
as the mutilated records of a barbarous people are placed by priest and
professor above the reason of mankind, we shall reap but little benefit
from church or school.Laws That Want Repealing

All laws defining and punishing blasphemy--making it a crime to give
your honest ideas about the Bible, or to laugh at the ignorance of
the ancient Jews, or to enjoy yourself on the Sabbath, or to give your
opinion of Jehovah, were passed by impudent bigots, and should be at
once repealed by honest men.Government Secular

Our government should be entirely and purely secular.The religious
views of a candidate should be kept entirely out of sight.He should not
be compelled to give his opinion as to the inspiration of the bible,
the propriety of infant baptism, or the immaculate conception.He should be allowed to settle such
things for himself.In 1876, our forefathers retired God from politics.They said all
power comes from the people.They kept God out of the Constitution, and
allowed each State to settle the question for itself.Candidates Made Hypocrites

Candidates are forced to pretend that they are Catholics with Protestant
proclivities, or Christians with liberal tendencies, or temperance men
who now and then take a glass of wine, or, that although not members of
any church their wives are, and that they subscribe liberally to
all.The result of all this is that we reward hypocrisy and elect men
entirely destitute of real principle; and this will never change until
the people become grand enough to allow each other to do their own
thinking.The Church and the Throne

So our fathers said: "We shall form a secular government, and under the
flag with which we are going to enrich the air, we will allow every man
to worship God as he thinks best."They said: "Religion is an individual
thing between each man and his Creator, and he can worship as he pleases
and as he desires."The history of the world
warned them that the liberty of man was not safe in the clutch and grasp
of any church.They had read of and seen the thumbscrews, the racks and
the dungeons of the inquisition.They knew all about the hypocrisy of
the olden time.They knew that the church had stood side by side with
the throne; that the high priests were hypocrites, and that the kings
were robbers.They also knew that if they gave to any church power, it
would corrupt the best church in the world.And so they said that power
must not reside in a church, nor in a sect, but power must be wherever
humanity is--in the great body of the people.And the officers and
servants of the people must be responsible.And so I say again, as
I said in the commencement, this is the wisest, the profoundest, the
bravest political document that ever was written and signed by man.The Old Idea

What was the old idea?The old idea was that no political power came
from, nor in any manner belonged to, the people.The old idea was that
the political power came from the clouds; that the political power came
in some miraculous way from heaven; that it came down to kings, and
queens, and robbers.The nobles lived upon the
labor of the people; the people had no rights; the nobles stole what
they had and divided with the kings, and the kings pretended to divide
what they stole with God Almighty.The source, then, of political power
was from above.The people were responsible to the nobles, the nobles to
the king, and the people had no political rights whatever, no more than
the wild beasts of the forest.The kings were responsible to God, not to
the people.The kings were responsible to the clouds, not to the toiling
millions they robbed and plundered.Liberty for Politicians

I would like also to liberate the politician.At present, the successful
office-seeker is a good deal like the centre of the earth; he weighs
nothing himself, but draws everything else to him.There are so many
societies, so many churches, so many isms, that it is almost impossible
for an independent man to succeed in a political career.Tax all Church Property

I am in favor of the taxation of all church property.If that property
belongs to God, he is able to pay the tax.If we exempt anything, let
us exempt the home of the widow and orphan.The church has to-day
$600,000,000 or $700,000,000 of property in this country.It must cost
$2,000,000 a week, that is to say $500 a minute to run these churches.You give me this money and if I don't do more good with it than
four times as many churches I'll resign.Let them make the churches
attractive and they'll get more hearers.They will have less empty pews
if they have less empty heads in the pulpit.The time will come when the
preacher will become a teacher.The Source of Power

The Declaration of Independence announces the sublime truth, that all
power comes from the people.This was a denial, and the first denial of
a nation, of the infamous dogma that God confers the right upon one man
to govern others.It was the first grand assertion of the dignity of the
human race.It declared the governed to be the source of power, and in
fact denied the authority of any and all gods.The Best Blood of the Old Word come to the New

The kings of the old world endeavored to parcel out this land to their
favorites.There was too much courage
required for them to take and keep it, and so men had to come here
who were dissatisfied with the old country--who were dissatisfied
with England, dissatisfied with France, with Germany, with Ireland and
Holland.Men came here for liberty,
and on account of certain principles they entertained and held dearer
than life.And they were willing to work, willing to fell the forests,
to fight the savages, willing to go through all the hardships, perils
and dangers of a new country, of a new land; and the consequences was
that our country was settled by brave and adventurous spirits, by men
who had opinions of their own, and were willing to live in the wild
forests for the sake of expressing those opinions, even if they
expressed them only to trees, rocks, and savage men.The best blood of
the old world came to the new.No State Church

Happily for us, there was no church strong enough to dictate to the
rest.Fortunately for us, the colonists not only, but the colonies
differed widely in their religious views.There were the Puritans who
hated the Episcopalians, and Episcopalians who hated the Catholics,
and the Catholics who hated both, while the Quakers held them all in
contempt.There they were of every sort, and color, and kind, and how
was it that they came together?They
wanted to form a new nation.More than that, most of them cordially
hated Great Britain; and they pledged each other to forget these
religious prejudices, for a time at least, and agreed that there should
be only one religion until they got through, and that was the religion
of patriotism.They solemnly agreed that the new nation should not
belong to any particular church, but that it should secure the rights of
all.The Enthusiasts of 1776

These grand men were enthusiasts; and the world has only been raised
by enthusiasts.In every country there have been a few who have given
a national aspiration to the people.The enthusiasts of 1776 were the
builders and framers of this great and splendid government; and they
were the men who saw, although others did not, the golden fringe of the
mantle of glory, that will finally cover this world.They knew, they
felt, they believed they would give a new constellation to the political
heavens--that they would make the Americans a grand people--grand as
the continent upon which they lived.The Church Must Have no Sword

Our fathers founded the first secular government that was ever founded
in this world.The first secular government; the first
government that said every church has exactly the same rights and no
more.In other words our fathers were the first men who had the sense,
had the genius, to know that no church should be allowed to have a
sword; that it should be allowed only to exert its moral influence.I want the power where some one can use
it.As long as a man is responsible to the people there is no fear of
despotism.And when any man talks about
despotism, you may be sure he wants to steal or be up to devilment.If
we have any sense, we have got to have localization of brain.If we have
any power, we must have centralization.We want centralization of the
right kind.The man we choose for our head wants the army in one hand,
the navy in the other; and to execute the supreme will of the supreme
people.In the long run the nation that is honest, the people that are
industrious, will pass the people that are dishonest, the people that
are idle; no matter what grand ancestry they might have had.To work for others is, in reality, the only way in which a man can work
for himself.Speculators cannot make unless
somebody loses.In the realm of speculation, every success has at least
one victim.The harvest reaped by the farmer benefits all and injures
none.For him to succeed, it is not necessary that some one should fail.The same is true of all producers--of all laborers.State Sovereignty

I despise the doctrine of State sovereignty.I believe in the rights
of the States, but not in the sovereignty of the States.Rising above States as the Alps above valleys
are the rights of man.Rising above the rights of the government even in
this Nation are the sublime rights of the people.Governments are good
only so long as they protect human rights.But the rights of a man never
should be sacrificed upon the altar of the State or upon the altar of
the Nation.The King of America

I am not only in favor of free speech, but I am also in favor of an
absolutely honest ballot.There is one king in this country; there
is one emperor; there is one supreme czar; and that is the legally
expressed will of the majority of the people.The man who casts an
illegal vote, the man who refuses to count a legal vote, poisons the
fountain of power, poisons the spring of justice, and is a traitor to
the only king in this land.I have always said, and I say again, that
the more liberty there is given away the more you have.There is room in
this world for us all; there is room enough for all of our thoughts;
out upon the intellectual sea there is room for every sail, and in the
intellectual air there is space for every wing.A man that exercises a
right that he will not give to others is a barbarian.A State that does
not allow free speech is uncivilized, and is a disgrace to the American
Union.I have been told that during the war we had plenty of money.I saw promises for dollars,
but not dollars.And the greenback, unless you have the gold behind it,
is no more a dollar than a bill of fare is a dinner.You cannot make
a paper dollar without taking a dollar's worth of paper.I want it issued by the government, and I
want behind every one of these dollars either a gold or silver dollar,
so that every greenback under the flag can lift up its hand and swear,
"I know that my redeemer liveth."The Wail of Dead Nations

A government founded upon anything except liberty and justice cannot and
ought not to stand.All the wrecks on either side of the stream of time,
all the wrecks of the great cities, and all the nations that have passed
away--all are a warning that no nation founded upon injustice can stand.From the sand-enshrouded Egypt, from the marble wilderness of Athens,
and from every fallen, crumbling stone of the once mighty Rome, comes
a wail, as it were, the cry that no nation founded upon injustice can
permanently stand.What the Republican Party Did

I am a Republican.I will tell you why: This is the only free government
in the world.The Republican party took
the chains from 4,000,000 of people.The Republican party, with the wand
of progress, touched the auction-block and it became a school-house; The
Republican party put down the rebellion, saved the nation, kept the old
banner afloat in the air, and declared that slavery of every kind should
be exterpated from the face of the continent.Doings of Democrats

I am opposed to the Democratic party, and I will tell you why.Every
State that seceded from the United States was a Democratic State.Every
ordinance of secession that was drawn was drawn by a Democrat.Every man
that endeavored to tear the old flag from the heaven that it enriches
was a Democrat.Every man that tried to destroy the nation was a
Democrat.Every enemy this great republic has had for twenty years has
been a Democrat.Every man that shot Union soldiers was a Democrat.Every man that starved Union soldiers and refused them in the extremity
of death, a crust, was a Democrat.Every man that loved slavery better
than liberty was a Democrat.The man that assassinated Abraham Lincoln
was a Democrat.Every man that sympathized with the assassin--every
man glad that the noblest President ever elected was assassinated, was a
Democrat.Every man that wanted the privilege of whipping another man to make him
work for him for nothing and pay him with lashes on his naked back, was
a Democrat.Every man that raised blood-hounds to pursue human beings
was a Democrat.Every man that clutched from shrieking, shuddering,
crouching mothers, babes from their breasts, and sold them into slavery,
was a Democrat.Every man that impaired the credit of the United States,
every man that swore we would never pay the bonds, every man that swore
we would never redeem the greenbacks, every maligner of his country's
credit, every calumniator of his country's honor, was a Democrat.Every
man that resisted the draft, every man that hid in the bushes and shot
at Union men simply because they were endeavoring to enforce the laws
of their country, was a Democrat.Every man that wept over the corpse of
slavery was a Democrat.The flag that will not protect its protectors is a dirty rag that
contaminates the air in which it waves.The government that will not
defend its defenders is a disgrace to the nations of the world.I am
a Republican because the Republican party says, "We will protect the
rights of American citizens at home, and if necessary we will march
an army into any State to protect the rights of the humblest American
citizen in that State."I am a Republican because that party allows
me to be free--allows me to do my own thinking in my own way.I am a
Republican because it is a party grand enough and splendid enough and
sublime enough to invite every human being in favor of liberty and
progress to fight shoulder to shoulder for the advancement of mankind.It invites the Methodist; it invites the Catholic; it invites the
Presbyterian and every kind of sectarian; it invites the free-thinker;
it invites the infidel, provided he is in favor of giving to every other
human being every chance and every right that he claims for himself.I
am a Republican, I tell you.Every man that tried to spread smallpox and yellow fever
in the North, as the instrumentalities of civilized war, was a Democrat.Soldiers, every scar you have got on your heroic bodies was given you
by a Democrat.Every scar, every arm that is lacking, every limb that
is gone, every scar is a souvenir of a Democrat.Every man that was the enemy of human liberty in this country was a
Democrat.Every man that wanted the fruit of all the heroism of all the
ages to turn to ashes upon the lips--every one was a Democrat.Give Every Man a Chance

Now, my friends, thousands of the Southern people, and thousands of the
Northern Democrats, are afraid that the <DW64>s are going to pass them
in the race for life.Democrat, he will do it unless you attend
to your business.The simple fact that you are white cannot save you
always.You have got to be industrious, honest, to cultivate a justice.If you don't the <DW52> race will pass you, as sure as you live.I am
for giving every man a chance.Shall the people that saved this country rule it?Shall the men who
saved the old flag hold it?Shall the men who saved the ship of state
sail it?or shall the rebels walk her quarter-deck, give the orders
and sink it?Shall a solid South, a united South,
united by assassination and murder, a South solidified by the shot-gun;
shall a united South, with the aid of a divided North, shall they
control this great and splendid country?Well, then, the North must
wake up.We are right back where we were in 1861.This is simply a
prolongation of the war.This is the war of the idea, the other was the
war of the musket.The other was the war of cannon, this is the war of
thought, and we have got to beat them in this war of thought, recollect
that.The question is, Shall the men who endeavored to destroy this
country rule it?Shall the men that said, This is not a nation, have
charge of the nation?The Declaration of Independence

The Declaration of Independence is the grandest, the bravest, and
the profoundest political document that was ever signed by the
representatives of the people.It is the embodiment of physical and
moral courage and of political wisdom.I say physical courage, because
it was a declaration of war against the most powerful nation then on the
globe; a declaration of war by thirteen weak, unorganized colonies; a
declaration of war by a few people, without military stores, without
wealth, without strength, against the most powerful kingdom on the
earth; a declaration of war made when the British navy, at that day the
mistress of every sea, was hovering along the coast of America, looking
after defenseless towns and villages to ravage and destroy.It was made
when thousands of English soldiers were upon our soil, and when the
principal cities of America were in the substantial possession of
the enemy.And so, I say, all things considered, it was the bravest
political document ever signed by man.I have a dream that this world is growing better and better every day
and every year; that there is more charity, more justice, more love
every day.I have a dream that prisons will not always curse the earth;
that the shadow of the gallows will not always fall on the land; that
the withered hand of want will not always be stretched out for charity;
that finally wisdom will sit in the legislature, justice in the courts,
charity will occupy all the pulpits, and that finally the world will be
controlled by liberty and love, by justice and charity.That is my
dream, and if it does not come true, it shall not be my fault.The Column of July

I stood, a little while ago, in the city of Paris, where stood the
Bastile, where now stands the column of July, surmounted by the figure
of Liberty.In its right hand is a broken chain, in its left hand a
hammer; upon its shining forehead a glittering star--and as I looked
upon it I said, such is the Republican party of my country.A Nation of Rascals

Samuel J. Tilden says we are a nation of thieves and rascals.If that is
so he ought to be President.But I denounce him as a calumniator of
my country; a maligner of this nation.This country is
covered with asylums for the aged, the helpless, the insane, the orphan,
the wounded soldiers.Thieves and rascals don't build such things.In the cities of the Atlantic coast this summer, they built floating
hospitals, great ships, and took the little children from the
sub-cellars and narrow, dirty streets of New York city, where the
Democratic party is the strongest--took these poor waifs and put them in
these great hospitals out at sea, and let the breezes of ocean kiss the
rose of health back to their pallid cheeks.Rascals and thieves do not
do so.When Chicago burned, railroads were blocked with the charity of
the American people.Thieves and rascals did not do so.We are a Great People

We are a great people.Three millions have increased to fifty--thirteen
states to thirty-eight.We have better homes, and more of the
conveniences of life than any other people upon the face of the globe.The farmers of our country live better than did the kings and princes
two hundred years ago--and they have twice as much sense and heart.Remember that the man who acts best his part--who loves
his friends the best--is most willing to help others--truest to the
obligation--who has the best heart--the most feeling--the deepest
sympathies--and who freely gives to others the rights that he claims for
himself, is the best man.We have disfranchised the aristocrats of the
air, and have given one country to mankind.Mule Equality

Suppose there was a great horse-race here to-day, free to every horse
in the world, and to all the mules, and all the scrubs, and all the
donkeys.At the tap of the drum they come to the line, and the judges
say "it is a go."Let me ask you, what does the blooded horse, rushing
ahead, with nostrils distended, drinking in the breath of his own
swiftness, with his mane flying like a banner of victory, with his veins
standing out all over him, as if a net of life had been cast around
him--with his thin neck, his high withers, his tremulous flanks--what
does he care how many mules and donkeys run on the track?But the
Democratic scrub, with his chuckle-head and lop-ears, with his tail full
of cockle-burs, jumping high and short, and digging in the ground when
he feels the breath of the coming mule on his cockle-bur tail, he is
the chap that jumps the track and says, "I am down on mule equality."My
friends, the Republican party is the blooded horse in this race.There is room in the Republican air for every wing; there is room on
the Republican sea for every sail.Republicanism says to every man: "Let
your soul be like an eagle; fly out in the great dome of thought, and
question the stars for yourself."I am a Republican because it is the only free party that ever existed.It is a party that had a platform as broad as humanity, a platform as
broad as the human race, a party that says you shall have all the
fruit of the labor of your hands, a party that says you may think for
yourself; a party that says no chains for the hands, no fetters for the
soul.Our Government the best on Earth

We all want a good government.We
all want to live in a land where the law is supreme.We desire to live
beneath a flag that will protect every citizen beneath its folds.We
desire to be citizens of a government so great and so grand that it will
command the respect of the civilized world.Most of us are convinced
that our government is the best upon this earth.Will the Second Century of America be as good as the First?Standing here amid the sacred memories of the first, on the golden
threshold of the second, I ask, Will the second century be as good
as the first?I believe it will because we are growing more and more
humane; I believe there is more human kind-ness and a greater desire
to help one another in America, than in all the world besides.The steam
engine--the telegraph--these are but the toys with which science has
been amusing herself.A grander standard of character, of literature and
art.We have now half as many millions of people as we have years.We are struggling more and more to get at the philosophy of
life--trying more and more to answer the questions of the eternal
Sphinx.The second century will be grander than the first.Science found agriculture plowing with a stick--reaping with a
sickle--commerce at the mercy of the treacherous waves and the
inconstant winds--a world without books--without schools--man denying
the authority of reason, employing his ingenuity in the manufacture
of instruments of torture, in building inquisitions and cathedrals.It found the land filled with malicious monks--with persecuting
Protestants, and the burners of men.The glory of science is, that it is
freeing the soul--breaking the mental manacles--getting the brain out
of bondage--giving courage to thought--filling the world with mercy,
justice, and joy.The Tables Turned

For the establishment of facts, the word of man is now considered
far better than the word of God.In the world of science, Jehovah was
superseded by Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler.All that God told
Moses, admitting the entire account to be true, is dust and ashes
compared to the discoveries of Des Cartes, La Place, and Humboldt.In
matters of fact, the Bible has ceased to be regarded as a standard.Science has succeeded in breaking the chains of theology.A few years
ago, science endeavored to show that it was not inconsistent with the
Bible.The tables have been turned, and now, religion is endeavoring to
prove that the Bible is not inconsistent with science.Science Better than a Creed

It seems to me that a belief in the great truths of science are fully as
essential to salvation, as the creed of any church.We are taught that
a man may be perfectly acceptable to God even if he denies the rotundity
of the earth, the Copernican system, the three laws of Kepler, the
indestructibility of matter and the attraction of gravitation.And we
are also taught that a man may be right upon all these questions, and
yet, for failing to believe in the "scheme of salvation," be eternally
lost.The Religion of Science

Every assertion of individual independence has been a step toward
infidelity.Luther started toward Humboldt,--Wesley, toward John Stuart
Mill.To really reform the church is to destroy it.Every new religion
has a little less superstition than the old, so that the religion of
science is but a question of time.Science not Sectarian

The sciences are not sectarian.People do not persecute each other on
account of disagreements in mathematics.Families are not divided about
botany, and astronomy does not even tend to make a man hate his father
and mother.It is what people do not know, that they persecute each
other about.Science will bring, not a sword, but peace.The Epitaph of all Religions

Science has written over the high altar its mene, mene, tekel,
UPHARSIN--the old words, destined to be the epitaph of all religions?The Real Priest

When we abandon the doctrine that some infinite being created matter
and force, and enacted a code of laws for their government, the idea
of interference will be lost.The real priest will then be, not the
mouth-piece of some pretended deity, but the interpreter of nature.From
that moment the church ceases to exist.The tapers will die out upon the
dusty altar; the moths will eat the fading velvet of pulpit and pew;
the Bible will take its place with the Shastras, Puranas, Vedas, Eddas,
Sagas and Korans, and the fetters of a degrading faith will fall from
the minds of men.Science is Power

From a philosophical point of view, science is knowledge of the laws
of life; of the conditions of happiness; of the facts by which we are
surrounded, and the relations we sustain to men and things--by means
of which, man, so to speak, subjugates nature and bends the elemental
powers to his will, making blind force the servant of his brain.Science Supreme

The element of uncertainty will, in a great measure, be removed from the
domain of the future, and man, gathering courage from a succession of
victories over the obstructions of nature, will attain a serene grandeur
unknown to the disciples of any superstition.The plans of mankind will
no longer be interfered with by the finger of a supposed omnipotence,
and no one will believe that nations or individuals are protected or
destroyed by any deity whatever.Science, freed from the chains of pious
custom and evangelical prejudice, will, within her sphere, be supreme.The mind will investigate without reverence, and publish its conclusions
without fear.Agassiz will no longer hesitate to declare the Mosaic
cosmogony utterly inconsistent with the demonstrated truths of geology,
and will cease pretending any reverence for the Jewish scriptures.The
moment science succeeds in rendering the church powerless for evil, the
real thinkers will be outspoken.The little flags of truce carried by
timid philosophers will disappear, and the cowardly parley will give
place to victory--lasting and universal.Science Opening the Gates of Thought

We are not endeavoring to chain the future, but to free the present.We
are not forging fetters for our children, but we are breaking those our
fathers made for us.We are the advocates of inquiry, of investigation
and thought.This of itself, is an admission that we are not perfectly
satisfied with all our conclusions.Philosophy has not the egotism of
faith.While superstition builds walls and creates obstructions, science
opens all the highways of thought.Stars and Grains of Sand

We do not say that we have discovered all; that our doctrines are the
all in all of truth.We know of no end to the development of man.We
cannot unravel the infinite complications of matter and force.The
history of one monad is as unknown as that of the universe; one drop of
water is as wonderful as all the seas; one leaf, as all the forests; and
one grain of sand, as all the stars.The Trinity of Science

Reason, Observation and Experience--the Holy Trinity of Science--have
taught us that happiness is the only good; that the time to be happy is
now, and the way to be happy is to make others so.In this belief we are content to live and die.If by any possibility
the existence of a power superior to, and independent of, nature shall
be demonstrated, there will then be time enough to kneel.Until then,
let us all stand nobly erect.The Old and the New Old ideas perished in the retort of the
chemist, and useful truths took their places.One by one religious
conceptions have been placed in the crucible of science, and thus far,
nothing but dross has been found.A new world has been discovered by the
microscope; everywhere has been found the infinite; in every direction
man has investigated and explored, and nowhere, in earth or stars,
has been found the footstep of any being superior to or independent
of nature.Nowhere has been discovered the slightest evidence of any
interference from without.The Triumphs of Science

I do not know what inventions are in the brain of the future; I do not
know what garments of glory may be woven for the world in the loom of
years to be; we are just on the edge of the great ocean of discovery.I
do not know what is to be discovered; I do not know what science will do
for us.I do know that science did just take a handful of sand and make
the telescope, and with it read all the starry leaves of heaven; I know
that science took the thunderbolts from the hands of Jupiter, and now
the electric spark, freighted with thought and love, flashes under the
waves of the sea; I know that science stole a tear from the cheek of
unpaid labor, converted it into steam, and created a giant that turns
with tireless arms the countless wheels of toil; I know that science
broke the chains from human limbs and gave us instead the forces of
nature for our slaves; I know that we have made the attraction of
gravitation work for us; we have made the lightnings our messengers; we
have taken advantage of fire and flames and wind and sea; these slaves
have no backs to be whipped; they have no hearts to be lacerated; they
have no children to be stolen, no cradles to be violated.I know that
science has given us better houses; I know it has given us better
pictures and better books; I know it has given us better wives and
better husbands, and more beautiful children.I know it has enriched
a thousand-fold our life; and therefore I am in favor of perfect
intellectual liberty.It found the world at the mercy of disease and famine; men trying to
read their fates in the stars, and to tell their fortunes by signs and
wonders; generals thinking to conquer their enemies by making the sign
of the cross, or by telling a rosary.It found all history full of petty
and ridiculous falsehood, and the Almighty was supposed to spend most
of his time turning sticks into snakes, drowning boys for swimming on
Sunday, and killing little children for the purpose of converting their
parents.It found the earth filled with slaves and tyrants, the people
in all countries downtrodden, half naked, half starved, without hope,
and without reason in the world.Science the only Lever

Such was the condition of man when the morning of science dawned upon
his brain, and before he had heard the sublime declaration that the
universe is governed by law.For the change that has taken place we are
indebted solely to science--the only lever capable of raising mankind.Abject faith is barbarism; reason is civilization.To obey is slavish;
to act from a sense of obligation perceived by the reason, is noble.Ignorance worships mystery; Reason explains it: the one grovels, the
other soars.I have sometimes wished that there were words of pure hatred out of
which I might construct sentences like snakes, out of which I might
construct sentences with mouths fanged, that had forked tongues, out of
which I might construct sentences that writhed and and hissed; then I
could give my opinion of the rebels during the great struggle for the
preservation of this nation.Slavery in the Name of Religion

Just think of it!Our churches and best people, as they call themselves,
defending the institution of slavery.When I was a little boy I used
to see steamers go down the Mississippi river with hundreds of men and
women chained hand to hand, and even children, and men standing about
them with whips in their hands and pistols in their pockets in the name
of liberty, in the name of civilization and in the name of religion!I
used to hear them preach to these slaves in the South and the only text
they ever took was "Servants be obedient unto your masters."That was
the salutation of the most merciful God to a man whose back was bleeding
that was the salutation of the most merciful God to the slave-mother
bending over an empty cradle, to the woman from whose breast a child
had been stolen--"Servants be obedient unto your masters."That was
what they said to a man running for his life and for his liberty through
tangled swamps and listening to the baying of blood-hounds, and when
he listened for them the voice came from heaven:--"Servants be obedient
unto your masters."Think how we have crouched and cringed before wealth even!How
they used to cringe in old times before a man who was rich--there are so
many of them gone into bankruptcy lately that we are losing a little of
our fear.The Patrons of Slavery

It is not possible for the human imagination to conceive of the horrors
of slavery.It has left no possible wrong uncommitted, no possible crime
un-perpetrated.It has been practiced and defended by all nations in
some form.It has been defended
by nearly every pulpit.From the profits derived from the slave trade,
churches have been built, cathedrals reared and priests paid.Slavery
has been blessed by bishop, by cardinal and by pope.It has received the
sanction of statesmen, of kings, of queens.Clergymen have taken their part of the spoil, reciting passages
of scripture in its defense, and judges have taken their portion in the
name of equity and law.A <DW52> Man in Congress

The world has changed!I have had the supreme pleasure of seeing a
man--once a slave--sitting in the seat of his former master in the
Congress of the United States.When I saw that sight, my eyes were
filled with tears.I felt that we had carried out the Declaration of
Independence, that we had given reality to it, and breathed the breath
of life into every word.I felt that our flag would float over and
protect the <DW52> man and his little children--standing straight in
the sun--just the same as though he were white and worth a million!The Zig-zag Strip

I have some excuses to offer for the race to which I belong.My first
excuse is that this is not a very good world to raise folks in anyway.It is not very well adapted to raising magnificent people.There's only
a quarter of it land to start with.It is three times better for raising
fish than folks; and in that one-quarter of land there is not a tenth
part fit to raise people on.You can't raise people without a good
climate.You have got to have the right kind of climate, and you have
got to have certain elements in the soil or you can't raise good people.Do you know that there is only a little zig-zag strip around the world
within which have been produced all men of genius?Black People have Suffered Enough

In my judgment the black people have suffered enough.They have been
slaves for two hundred years.They have been owned two hundred years,
and, more than all, they have been compelled to keep the company of
those who owned them.Think of being compelled to keep the society of
the man who is stealing from you.Think of being compelled to live with
a man that stole your child from the cradle before your very eyes.Think
of being compelled to live with a thief all your life, to spend your
days with a white loafer, and to be under his control.The History of Civilization

The history of civilization is the history of the slow and painful
enfranchisement of the human race.In the olden times the family was a
monarchy, the father being the monarch.The mother and children were the
veriest slaves.The will of the father was the supreme law.He had the
power of life and death.It took thousands of years to civilize this
father, thousands of years to make the condition of the wife and mother
and children even tolerable.A few families constituted a tribe; the
tribe had a chief; the chief was a tyrant; a few tribes formed a nation;
the nation was governed by a king, who was also a tyrant.A strong
nation robbed, plundered and took captive the weaker ones.Is there, in the civilized world, to-day, a clergyman who believes
in the divinity of slavery?Does the Bible teach man to enslave his
brother?If it does, is it not blasphemous to say that it is inspired
of God?If you find the institution of slavery upheld in a book said
to have been written by God, what would you expect to find in a book
inspired by the devil?Would you expect to find that book in favor of
liberty?Modern Christians, ashamed of the God of the Old Testament,
endeavor now to show that slavery was neither commanded nor opposed by
Jehovah.Solemn Defiance

For my part, I never will, I never can, worship a God who upholds the
institution of slavery.I neither want his
heaven, nor fear his hell.The Soldiers of the Republic

The soldiers of the Republic were not seekers after vulgar glory.They
were not animated by the hope of plunder or the love of conquest.They
fought to preserve the blessings of liberty and that their children
might have peace.They were the defenders of humanity, the destroyers
of prejudice, the breakers of chains, and in the name of the future they
slew the monster of their time.They blotted from the statute books laws that
had been passed by hypocrites at the instigation of robbers, and tore
with indignant hands from the Constitution that infamous clause that
made men the catchers of their fellow men.They made it possible for
judges to be just, for statesmen to be human, and for politicians to be
honest.They broke the shackles from the limbs of slaves, from the souls
of martyrs, and from the Northern brain.They kept our country on the
map of the world and our flag in heaven.Seven long years of war--fighting for what?For the principle that
all men were created equal--a truth that nobody ever disputed except
a scoundrel; nobody in the entire history of this world.No man ever
denied that truth who was not a rascal, and at heart a thief; never,
never, and never will.Simply that in
America every man should have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.Nobody ever denied that except a villain; never, never.It has been denied by kings--they were thieves.It has been denied by
statesmen--they were liars.It has been denied by priests, by clergymen,
by cardinals, by bishops and by popes--they were hypocrites.For the idea that all political power is vested
in the great body of the people.They make all the money; do all the
work.They plow the land; cut down the forests; they produce everything
that is produced.Then who shall say what shall be done with what is
produced except the producer?The Revolution Consummated

The soldiers of the Republic finished what the soldiers of the
Revolution commenced.They relighted the torch that fell from their
august hands and filled the world again with light.The soldiers went home to their waiting wives, to their glad children,
and to the girls they loved--they went back to the fields, the shops and
mines.They were
as honest in peace as they had been brave in war.Mocking at poverty,
laughing at reverses, they made a friend of toil.They said: "We saved
the nation's life, and what is life without honor?"They worked and
wrought with all of labor's sons, that every pledge the nation gave
should be redeemed.And their great leader, having put a shining hand of
friendship--a girdle of clasped and happy hands--around the globe, comes
home and finds that every promise made in war has now the ring and gleam
of gold.Manhood worth more than Gold

We say in this country manhood is worth more than gold.We say in this
country that without liberty the Nation is not worth preserving.I
appeal to every laboring man, and I ask him, "Is there another country
on this globe where you can have your equal rights with others?"Now,
then, in every country, no matter how good it is, and no matter how bad
it is--in every country there is something worth preserving, and there
is something that ought to be destroyed.Now recollect that every voter
is in his own right a king; every voter in this country wears a crown;
every voter in this country has in his hands the scepter of authority;
and every voter, poor and rich, wears the purple of authority alike.Recollect it; and the man that will sell his vote is the man that
abdicates the American throne.Grander than the Greek, nobler than the Roman, the soldiers of the
republic, with patriotism as taintless as the air, battled for the
rights of others; for the nobility of labor; fought that mothers might
own their babes; that arrogant idleness should not scar the back of
patient toil, and that our country should not be a many-headed monster
made of warring States, but a Nation, sovereign, great and free.Blood
was water; money, leaves, and life was common air until one flag floated
over a republic without a master and without a slave.Let us Drink to the Living and the Dead

The soldiers of the Union saved the South as well as the North.Their victory made us free and rendered tyranny in
every other land as insecure as snow upon volcano lips.And now let us
drink to the volunteers, to those who sleep in unknown, sunken graves,
whose names are only in the hearts of those they loved and left--of
those who only hear in happy dreams the footsteps of return.Let us
drink to those who died where lipless famine mocked at want--to all the
maimed whose scars give modesty a tongue, to all who dared and gave to
chance the care and keeping of their lives--to all the living and all
the dead--to Sherman, to Sheridan and to Grant, the foremost soldiers of
the world; and last, to Lincoln, whose loving life, like a bow of peace,
spans and arches all the clouds of war.Will the Wounds of the War be Healed?There is still another question: "Will all the wounds of the war be
healed?"The Southern people must submit, not to the
dictation of the North, but to the nation's will and to the verdict of
mankind.They were wrong, and the time will come when they will say
that they have been vanquished by the right.Freedom conquered them, and
freedom will cultivate their fields, educate their children, weave for
them the robes of wealth, execute their laws, and fill their land with
happy homes.Saviours of the Nation

They rolled the stone from the sepulchre of progress, and found therein
two angels clad in shining garments--nationality and liberty.The
soldiers were the Saviours of the Nation.In writing the proclamation of emancipation, Lincoln, greatest
of our mighty dead, whose memory is as gentle as the summer air,--when
reapers sing'mid gathered sheaves,--copied with the pen what Grant and
his brave comrades wrote with swords.General Grant

When the savagery of the lash, the barbarism of the chain, and the
insanity of secession confronted the civilization of our century, the
question, "Will the great republic defend itself?"trembled on the
lips of every lover of mankind.The North, filled with intelligence and
wealth, products of liberty, marshalled her hosts and asked only for
a leader.From civil life a man, silent, thoughtful, poised, and calm;
stepped forth, and with the lips of victory voiced the nation's first
and last demand: "Unconditional and immediate surrender."From that
moment the end was known.That utterance was the real declaration of
real war and in accordance with the dramatic unities of mighty
events, the great soldier who made it, received the final sword of the
rebellion.The soldiers of the republic were not seekers after vulgar
glory; they were not animated by the hope of plunder or the love of
conquest.They fought to preserve the homestead of liberty.MONEY THAT IS MONEY




142.Paper is not Money

Some people tell me that the government can impress its sovereignty on
a piece of paper, and that is money.Well, if it is, what's the use of
wasting it making one dollar bills?It takes no more ink and no more
paper--why not make $1000 bills?Why not make $100,000,000 and all be
billionaires?If the government can make money, what on earth does it
collect taxes for you and me for?Why don't it make what money it wants,
take the taxes out, and give the balance to us?Greenbacker, suppose
the government issued $1,000,000,000 to-morrow, how would you get any of
it?The Debt will be paid

It will be paid.The holders of the debt have got a mortgage on a
continent.They have a mortgage on the honor of the Republican party,
and it is on record.Every blade of grass that grows upon this continent
is a guarantee that the debt will be paid; every field of bannered corn
in the great, glorious West is a guarantee that the debt will be paid;
all the coal put away in the ground, millions of years ago by the old
miser, the sun; is a guarantee that every dollar of that debt will be
paid; all the cattle on the prairies, pastures and plains, every one of
them is a guarantee that this debt will be paid; every pine standing
in the sombre forests of the North, waiting for the woodman's axe, is
a guarantee that this debt will be paid; all the gold and silver hid in
the Sierra Nevadas, waiting for the miner's pick, is a guarantee that
the debt will be paid; every locomotive, with its muscles of iron and
breath of flame, and all the boys and girls bending over their books at
school, every dimpled child in the cradle, every good man and every good
woman, and every man that votes the Republican ticket, is a guarantee
that the debt will be paid.No man can imagine, all the languages of the world cannot express, what
the people of the United States suffered from 1873 to 1879.Men who
considered themselves millionaires found that they were beggars; men
living in palaces, supposing they had enough to give sunshine to the
winter of their age, supposing they had enough to have all they loved
in affluence and comfort, suddenly found that they were mendicants with
bonds, stocks, mortgages, all turned to ashes in their aged, trembling
hands.The chimneys grew cold, the fires in furnaces went out, the poor
families were turned adrift, and the highways of the United States were
crowded with tramps.Into the home of the poor crept the serpent of
temptation, and whispered in the ear of poverty the terrible word
"repudiation."A Voter because a Man

A man does not vote in this country simply because he is rich; he does
not vote in this country simply because he has an education; he does
not vote simply because he has talent or genius; we say that he votes
because he is a man, and that he has his manhood to support; and we
admit in this country that nothing can be more valuable to any human
being than his manhood, and for that reason we put poverty on an
equality with wealth.If you are a German, recollect that this country is kinder to you than
your own fatherland,--no matter what country you came from, remember
that this country is an asylum, and vote as in your conscience you
believe you ought to vote to keep this flag in heaven.I beg every
American to stand with that part of the country that believes in law, in
freedom of speech, in an honest vote, in civilization, in progress, in
human liberty, and in universal justice.Prosperity and Resumption hand in hand

The Republicans of the United States demand a man who knows that
prosperity and resumption, when they come, must come together; that when
they come they will come hand in hand through the golden harvest fields;
hand in hand by the whirling spindles and the turning wheels; hand in
hand past the open furnace doors; hand in hand by the chimneys filled
with eager fire, greeted and grasped by the countless sons of toil.This money has to be dug out of the earth.You cannot make it by passing
resolutions in a political convention.Every Poor Man should Stand by the Government

It is the only Nation where the man clothed in a rag stands upon an
equality with the one wearing purple.It is the only country in the
world where, politically, the hut is upon an equality with the palace.For that reason, every poor man should stand by the government, and
every poor man who does not is a traitor to the best interests of his
children; every poor man who does not is willing his children should
bear the badge of political inferiority; and the only way to make this
government a complete and perfect success is for the poorest man to
think as much of his manhood as the millionaire does of his wealth.I want to tell you that you cannot conceive of what the American people
suffered as they staggered over the desert of bankruptcy from 1873 to
1879.We are too near now to know how grand we were.The poor mechanic said
"No;" the ruined manufacturer said "No;" the once millionaire said "No,
we will settle fair; we will agree to pay whether we ever pay or
not, and we will never soil the American name with the infamous word,
'repudiation.'"Are you not glad
that our flag is covered all over with financial honors?The stars shine
and gleam now because they represent an honest nation.A Government with a Long Arm

I believe in a Government with an arm long enough to reach the collar
of any rascal beneath its flag.I want it with an arm long enough and
a sword sharp enough to strike down tyranny wherever it may raise its
snaky head.I want a nation that can hear the faintest cries of its
humblest citizen.I want a nation that will protect a freedman standing
in the sun by his little cabin, just as quick as it would protect
Vanderbilt in a palace of marble and gold.No Repudiation

Then it was, that the serpent of temptation whispered in the ear of want
that dreadful word "Repudiation."They
appealed to want, to misery, to threatened financial ruin, to the bare
hearthstones, to the army of beggars, We had grandeur enough to say:
"No; we'll settle fair if we don't pay a cent!"Is there a Democrat now who wishes we had taken the advice of
Bayard to scale the bonds?Is there an American, a Democrat here, who
is not glad we escaped the stench and shame of repudiation, and did not
take Democratic advice?Is there a Greenbacker here who is not glad we
didn't do it?He may say he is, but he isn't.I think there is the greatest heroism in living for a thing!There's no
glory in digging potatoes.You don't wear a uniform when you're picking
up stones.You can't have a band of music when you dig potatoes!In,
1873 came the great crash.No one can estimate the anguish of that time!Millionaires found
themselves paupers.The aged man,
who had spent his life in hard labor, and who thought he had accumulated
enough to support himself in his old age, and leave a little something
to his children and grandchildren, found they were all beggars.The
highways were filled with tramps.Promises Don't Pay

If I am fortunate enough to leave a dollar when I die, I want it to be
a good one; I don't wish to have it turn to ashes in the hands of
widowhood, or become a Democratic broken promise in the pocket of the
orphan; I want it money.I saw not long ago a piece of gold bearing the
stamp of the Roman Empire.That Empire is dust, and over it has been
thrown the mantle of oblivion, but that piece of gold is as good as
though Julius Caesar were still riding at the head of the Roman Legion.I want money to that will outlive the Democratic party.They told
us--and they were honest about it--they said, "when we have plenty of
money we are prosperous."And I said: "When we are prosperous, then we
have credit, and, credit inflates the currency.Whenever a man buys a
pound of sugar and says, 'Charge it,' he inflates the currency; whenever
he gives his note, he inflates the currency; whenever his word takes the
place of money, he inflates the currency."The consequence is that when
we are prosperous, credit takes the place of money, and we have what
we call "plenty."But you can't increase prosperity simply by using
promises to pay.I do not wish to trust the wealth of this nation with the demagogues of
the nation.I do not wish to trust the wealth of the country to every
blast of public opinion.I want money as solid as the earth on which we
tread, as bright as the stars that shine above us.The South and the Tariff

Where did this doctrine of a tariff for revenue only come from?The South would like to stab the prosperity of the North.They
had rather trade with Old England than with New England.They had rather
trade with the people who were willing to help them in war than those
who conquered the rebellion.They knew what gave us our strength in
war.They knew all the brooks and creeks and rivers in New England were
putting down the rebellion.They knew that every wheel that turned,
every spindle that revolved, was a soldier in the army of human
progress.They were so lured by the greed of office that
they were willing to trade upon the misfortune of a nation.I don't wish to belong to a party that succeeds only when my country
falls.I don't wish to belong to a party whose banner went up with
the banner of rebellion.I don't wish to belong to a party that was in
partnership with defeat and disaster.I am for Protection

And I will tell you why I am for protection, too.If we were all farmers
we would be stupid.If we were all shoemakers we would be stupid.If
we all followed one business, no matter what it was, we would become
stupid.Protection to American labor diversifies American industry, and
to have it diversified touches and developes every part of the human
brain.Protection protects integrity; it protects intelligence; and
protection raises sense; and by protection we have greater men and
better-looking women and healthier children.Free trade means that our
laborer is upon an equality with the poorest paid labor of this world.The Old Woman of Tewksbury

You Greenbackers are like the old woman in the Tewksbury, Mass.,
Poor-House.She used to be well off, and didn't like her quarters.You
Greenbackers have left your father's house of many mansions and have fed
on shucks about long enough.The Supervisor came into the Poor-House one
day and asked the old lady how she liked it.She said she didn't like
the company, and asked him what he would advise her to do under similar
circumstances."Do you think anybody is ever prejudiced in their sleep?"I dreamed I died and went to
Heaven.A nice man came to me and asked
me where I was from.Says I, 'From Tewksbury, Mass.'He looked in his
book and said, 'You can't stay here.'"I asked what he would advise me
to do under similar circumstances."'Well,' he said, 'there's hell down
there, you might try that.'"Well, I went down there, and the men told
me my name wasn't on the book and I couldn't stay there.'Well,' said I,
'What would you advise me to do under similar circumstances?''Said he,
'You'll have to go back to Tewksbury.'And when Green-backers remember
what they once were, you must feel now, when you were forced to join
the Democratic party, as bad as the old lady who had to go back to
Tewksbury.American Muscle, Coined into Gold

I believe in American labor, and I tell you why.The other day a man
told me that we had produced in the United States of America one million
tons of rails.In other
words, the million tons are worth $60,000,000.How much is a ton of iron
worth in the ground?American labor takes 25 cents of
iron in the ground and adds to it $59.75.One million tons of rails, and
the raw material not worth $24,000.We build a ship in the United States
worth $500,000, and the value of the ore in the earth, of the trees in
the great forest, of all that enters into the composition of that ship
bringing $500,000 in gold is only $20,000; $480,000 by American labor,
American muscle, coined into gold; American brains made a legal-tender
the world around.Inflation

I don't blame the man who wanted inflation.I don't blame him for
praying for another period of inflation."When it comes," said the man
who had a lot of shrunken property on his hands, "blame me, if I don't
unload, you may shoot me."It's a good deal like the game of poker!I
don't suppose any of you know anything about that game!Along towards
morning the fellow who is ahead always wants another deal.The fellow
that is behind says his wife's sick, and he must go home.You ought
to hear that fellow descant on domestic virtue!And the other fellow
accuses him of being a coward and wanting to jump the game.A man whose
dead wood is hung up on the shore in a dry time, wants the water to rise
once more and float it out into the middle of the stream.We have fifty-six thousand
square miles of land--nearly thirty-six million acres.Upon these plains
we can raise enough to feed and clothe twenty million people.Beneath
these prairies were hidden, millions of ages ago, by that old miser, the
sun, thirty-six thousand square miles of coal.The aggregate thickness
of these veins is at least fifteen feet.Think of a column of coal one
mile square and one hundred miles high!What
a sunbeam such a column would be!Think of all this force, willed and
left to us by the dead morning of the world!Think of the fireside of
the future around which will sit the fathers, mothers and children of
the years to be!Think of the sweet and happy faces, the loving and
tender eyes that will glow and gleam in the sacred light of all these
flames!They say that money is a measure of value.A bushel doesn't
measure values.If it measured
values, a bushel of potatoes would be worth as much as a bushel of
diamonds.They used to say,
"there's no use in having a gold yard-stick."You
don't buy the yard-stick.If money bore the same relation to trade as
a yard-stick or half-bushel, you would have the same money when you
got through trading as you had when you begun.A man don't sell
half-bushels.All we want is a little sense about these
things.Some said there
wasn't enough money.That's so; I know what that means myself.They said
if we had more money we'd be more prosperous.The truth is, if we
were more prosperous we'd have more money.They said more money would
facilitate business.Money by Work

How do you get your money?You have got to dig it
out of the ground.In old times there were
some men who thought they could get some way to turn the baser metals
into gold, and old gray-haired men, trembling, tottering on the verge of
the grave, were hunting for something to turn ordinary metals into gold;
they were searching for the fountain of eternal youth, but they did not
find it.No human ear has ever heard the silver gurgle of the spring of
immortal youth.Meat Twice a Year

I have been in countries where the laboring man had meat once a year;
sometimes twice--Christmas and Easter.And I have seen women carrying
upon their heads a burden that no man would like to carry, and at the
same time knitting busily with both hands.And those women lived without
meat; and when I thought of the American laborer I said to myself,
"After all, my country is the best in the world."And when I came back
to the sea and saw the old flag flying in the air, it seemed to me as
though the air from pure joy had burst into blossom.America a Glorious Land

Labor has more to eat and more to wear in the United States than in
any other land of this earth.I want America to produce everything
that Americans need.I want it so if the whole world should declare war
against us, so if we were surrounded by walls of cannon and bayonets and
swords, we could supply all human wants in and of ourselves.I want to
live to see the American woman dressed in American silk; the American
man in everything from hat to boots produced in America by the cunning
hand of the American toiler.How to Spend a Dollar

If you have only a dollar in the world and have got to spend it, spend
it like a man; spend it like a prince, like a king!If you have to spend
it, spend it as though it were a dried leaf, and you were the owner of
unbounded forests.Honesty is Best always and Everywhere

I am next in favor of honest money.I am in favor of gold and silver,
and paper with gold and silver behind it.I believe in silver, because
it is one of the greatest of American products, and I am in favor of
anything that will add to the value of American products.But I want a
silver dollar worth a gold dollar, even if you make it or have to make
it four feet in diameter.No government can afford to be a clipper of
coin.A great Republic cannot afford to stamp a lie upon silver or gold.Honest money, an honest people, an honest Nation.When our money is only
worth 80 cents on the dollar, we feel 20 per cent, below par.When our
money is good we feel good.When our money is at par, that is where we
are.I am a profound believer in the doctrine that for nations as well
as men, honesty is the best, always, everywhere and forever.A Fountain of Greenbacks

There used to be mechanics that tried to make perpetual motion by
combinations of wheels, shifting weights, and rolling balls; but somehow
the machine would never quite run.A perpetual fountain of greenbacks,
of wealth without labor, is just as foolish as a fountain of eternal
youth.The idea that you can produce money without labor is just as
foolish as the idea of perpetual motion.They are old follies under new
names.We had to borrow some money to pay for shot and
shell to shoot Democrats with.We found that we could get along with a
few less Democrats, but not with any less country, and so we borrowed
the money, and the question now is, will we pay it?And which party is
the most apt to pay it, the Republican party, that made the debt--the
party that swore it was constitutional, or the party that said it was
unconstitutional?Whenever a Democrat sees a greenback, the greenback
says to the Democrat, "I am one of the fellows that whipped you."Whenever a Republican sees a greenback, the greenback says to him, "You
and I put down the rebellion and saved the country."Honest Methods

So many presidents of savings banks, even those belonging to the Young
Men's Christian Association, run off with the funds; so many railroad
and insurance companies are in the hands of receivers; there is so much
bankruptcy on every hand, that all capital is held in the nervous clutch
of fear.Slowly, but surely, we are coming back to honest methods in
business.Confidence will return, and then enterprise will unlock the
safe and money will again circulate as of yore; the dollars will leave
their hitting places, and every one will be seeking investment.For my part I do not ask any interference on the part of the government
except to undo the wrong it has done.I do not ask that money be made
out of nothing.I do not ask for the prosperity born of paper.But I do
ask for the remonetization of silver.It was an imposition upon every solvent man; a fraud upon every honest
debtor in the United States.It was done in the
interest of avarice and greed, and should be undone by honest men.RELIGIOUS QUESTIONS




171.Redden your hands with human blood; blast by slander the fair fame
of the innocent; strangle the smiling child upon its mother's knees;
deceive, ruin and desert the beautiful girl who loves and trusts you,
and your case is not hopeless.For all this, and for all these you
may be forgiven.For all this, and for all these, that bankrupt court
established by the gospel, will give you a discharge; but deny the
existence of these divine ghosts, of these gods, and the sweet and
tearful face of Mercy becomes livid with eternal hate.Heaven's golden
gates are shut, and you, with an infinite curse ringing in your
ears, with the brand of infamy upon your brow, commence your endless
wanderings in the lurid gloom of hell--an immortal vagrant--an eternal
outcast--a deathless convict.Faith--A Mixture of Insanity and Ignorance

The doctrine that future happiness depends upon belief is monstrous.It is the infamy of infamies.The notion that faith in Christ is to
be rewarded by an eternity of bliss, while a dependence upon reason,
observation, and experience merits everlasting pain, is too absurd for
refutation, and can be relieved only by that unhappy mixture of insanity
and ignorance; called "faith."The church in the days of Voltaire contended that its servants were the
only legitimate physicians.The priests cured in the name of the church,
and in the name of God--by exorcism, relics, water, salt and oil.Gervasius was good for rheumatism, St.Ovidius
for deafness, St.Apollonia for
toothache, St.Clara for rheum in the eye, St.Devils were driven out with wax tapers, with incence (sp.), with holy
water, by pronouncing prayers.The church, as late as the middle of the
twelfth century, prohibited good Catholics from having anything to do
with physicians.The Sleep of Persecutors

All the persecutors sleep in peace, and the ashes of those who burned
their brothers in the name of Christ rest in consecrated ground.Whole
libraries could not contain even the names of the wretches who have
filled the world with violence and death in defense of book and creed,
and yet they all died the death of the righteous, and no priest or|
minister describes the agony and fear, the remorse and horror with which
their guilty souls were filled in the last moments of their lives.These
men had never doubted; they accepted the creed; they were not infidels;
they had not denied the divinity of Christ; they had been baptized;
they had partaken of the last supper; they had respected priests; they
admitted that the Holy Ghost had "proceeded;" and these things put
pillows beneath their dying heads and covered them with the drapery of
peace.There is no recorded instance where the uplifted hand of murder has been
paralyzed--no truthful account in all the literature of the world of the
innocent shielded by God.Thousands of crimes are being committed every
day--men are this moment lying in wait for their human prey; wives
are whipped and crushed, driven to insanity and death; little children
begging for mercy, lifting imploringly tear-filled eyes to the brutal
faces of fathers and mothers; sweet girls are deceived, lured, and
outraged; but God has no time to prevent these things--no time to defend
the good and to protect the pure.He is too busy numbering hairs and
watching sparrows.All kinds of criminals, except infidels, meet death with reasonable
serenity.As a rule, there is nothing in the death of a pirate to cast
any discredit on his profession.The murderer upon the scaffold, with
a priest on either side, smilingly exhorts the multitude to meet him in
heaven.The man who has succeeded in making his home a hell meets death
without a quiver, provided he has never expressed any doubt as to the
divinity of Christ or the eternal "procession" of the holy ghost.The
king who has waged cruel and useless war, who has filled countries with
widows and fatherless children, with the maimed and diseased, and who
has succeeded in offering to the Moloch of ambition the best and bravest
of his subjects, dies like a saint.The first Corpse and the first Cathedral

Now and then, in the history of this world, a man of genius, of sense,
of intellectual honesty has appeared.These men have denounced the
superstitions of their day.To see priests
devour the substance of the people filled them with indignation.These
men were honest enough to tell their thoughts.Then they were denounced,
condemned, executed.Some of them escaped the fury of the people who
loved their enemies, and died naturally in their beds.It would not be
for the church to admit that they died peacefully.That would show that
religion was not actually necessary in the last moment.Religion got
much of its power from the terror of death.Superstition is the child of
ignorance and fear.The first
corpse was the first priest.It would not do to have the common people
understand that a man could deny the Bible, refuse to look at the cross,
contend that Christ was only a man, and yet die as calmly as Calvin did
after he had murdered Servetus, or as King David, after advising one son
to kill another.The Sixteenth Century

In the sixteenth century every science was regarded as an outcast and an
enemy, and the church influenced the world, which was under its
power, to believe anything, and the ignorant mob was always too ready,
brutalized by the church, to hang, kill or crucify at their bidding.Such was the result of a few centuries of Christianity.An Orthodox Gentleman

By Orthodox I mean a gentleman who is petrified in his mind, whooping
around intellectually, simply to save the funeral expenses of his soul.A Bold Assertion

The churches point to their decayed saints, and their crumbled Popes
and say, "Do you know more than all the ministers that ever lived?"And without the slightest egotism or blush I say, yes, and the name of
Humboldt outweighs them all.The men who stand in the front rank, the
men who know most of the secrets of nature, the men who know most are
to-day the advanced infidels of this world.I have lived long enough to
see the brand of intellectual inferiority on every orthodox brain.If we admit that some infinite being has controlled the destinies of
persons and peoples, history becomes a most cruel and bloody farce.Age after age, the strong have trampled upon the weak; the crafty
and heartless have ensnared and enslaved the simple and innocent,
and nowhere, in all the annals of mankind, has any god succored the
oppressed.Weak ones Suffering--Heaven deaf

Most of the misery has been endured by the weak, the loving and the
innocent.Women have been treated like poisonous beasts, and little
children trampled upon as though they had been vermin.Numberless altars
have been reddened, even with the blood of babes; beautiful girls have
been given to slimy serpents; whole races of men doomed to centuries
of slavery, and everywhere there has been outrage beyond the power
of genius to express.During all these years the suffering have
supplicated; the withered lips of famine have prayed; the pale victims
have implored, and Heaven has been deaf and blind.Heaven has no Ear, no Hand

Man should cease to expect aid from on high.By this time he should know
that heaven has no ear to hear, and no hand to help.The present is the
necessary child of all the past.There has been no chance, and there can
be no interference.Religion is Tyrannical

Religion does not, and cannot, contemplate man as free.She accepts only
the homage of the prostrate, and scorns the offerings of those who stand
erect.The wide and sunny
fields belong not to her domain.The star-lit heights of genius and
individuality are above and beyond her appreciation and power.Her
subjects cringe at her feet, covered with the dust of obedience.Religion and Facts

What has religion to do with facts?Is there any such thing
as Methodist mathematics, Presbyterian botany, Catholic astronomy or
Baptist biology?What has any form of superstition or religion to do
with a fact or with any science?Nothing but hinder, delay or embarass.I want, then, to free the schools; and I want to free the politicians,
so that a man will not have to pretend he is a Methodist, or his wife
a Baptist, or his grandmother a Catholic; so that he can go through
a campaign, and when he gets through will find none of the dust of
hypocrisy on his knees.Religion not the End of Life

We deny that religion is the end or object of this life.When it is so
considered it becomes destructive of happiness--the real end of life.It becomes a hydra-headed monster, reaching in terrible coils from the
heavens, and thrusting its thousand fangs into the bleeding, quivering
hearts of men.It devours their substance, builds palaces for God, (who
dwells not in temples made with hands,) and allows his children to
die in huts and hovels.It fills the earth with mourning, heaven with
hatred, the present with fear, and all the future with despair.Creeds

Just in proportion that the human race has advanced, the Church has lost
power.No nation ever materially
advanced that held strictly to the religion of its founders.No nation
ever gave itself wholly to the control of the Church without losing its
power, its honor, and existence.Every Church pretends to have found
the exact truth.Every creed is a rock in running
water; humanity sweeps by it.Every creed cries to the universe, "Halt!"A creed is the ignorant Past bullying the enlightened Present.The Worst Religion in the World

The worst religion of the world was the Presbyterianism of Scotland as
it existed in the beginning of the eighteenth century.The kirk had all
the faults of the church of Rome, without a redeeming feature.The kirk
hated music, painting, statuary, and architecture.Anything touched with
humanity--with the dimples of joy--was detested and accursed.God was
to be feared, not loved.Happiness was a snare, and human love was wicked,
weak, and vain.The Presbyterian priest of Scotland was as cruel,
bigoted, and heartless as the familiar of the inquisition.In the beginning of this, the nineteenth century, a boy
seventeen years of age, Thomas Aikenhead, was indicted and tried
at Edinburgh for blasphemy.He had on several occasions, when cold,
jocularly wished himself in hell, that he might get warm.The poor,
frightened boy recanted--begged for mercy; but he was found guilty,
hanged, thrown in a hole at the foot of the scaffold; and his weeping
mother vainly begged that his bruised and bleeding body might be given
to her.Religion Demanding Miracles

The founder of a religion must be able to turn water into wine--cure
with a word the blind and lame, and raise with a simple touch the dead
to life.It was necessary for him to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of his barbarian disciple, that he was superior to nature.In times of
ignorance this was easy to do.The credulity of the savage was almost
boundless.To him the marvelous was the beautiful, the mysterious was
the sublime.Consequently, every religion has for its foundation a
miracle--that is to say, a violation of nature--that is to say, a
falsehood.We Want One Fact

We have heard talk enough.We have listened to all the drowsy, idealess,
vapid sermons that we wish to hear.We have read your Bible and the
works of your best minds.We have heard your prayers, your solemn groans
and your reverential amens.We beg at the doors of your churches for just one little
fact.We pass our hats along your pews and under your pulpits and
implore you for just one fact.We know all about your mouldy wonders and
your stale miracles.The Design Argument

These religious people see nothing but designs everywhere, and personal,
intelligent interference in everything.They insist that the universe
has been created, and that the adaptation of means to ends is perfectly
apparent.They point us to the sunshine, to the flowers, to the April
rain, and to all there is of beauty and of use in the world.Did it ever
occur to them that a cancer is as beautiful in its development as is the
reddest rose?That what they are pleased to call the adaptation of
means to ends, is as apparent in the cancer as in the April rain?By what ingenious methods the
blood is poisoned so that the cancer shall have food!By what wonderful
contrivances the entire system of man is made to pay tribute to this
divine and charming cancer!See by what admirable instrumentalities it
feeds itself from the surrounding quivering, dainty flesh!See how it
gradually but surely expands and grows!By what marvelous mechanism
it is supplied with long and slender roots that reach out to the most
secret nerves of pain for sustenance and life!Down, Forever Down

Down, forever down, with any religion that requires upon its ignorant
altar the sacrifice of the goddess Reason, that compels her to abdicate
forever the shining throne of the soul, strips from her form the
imperial purple, snatches from her hand the sceptre of thought and makes
her the bondwoman of a senseless faith!The Back

Upon this rack I have described, this victim was placed, and those
chains were attached to his ankles and then to his waist, and clergyman,
good men pious men!men that were shocked at the immorality of their
day!they talked about playing cards and the horrible crime of dancing!how such things shocked them; men going to the theatres and seeing a
play written by the grandest genius the world ever has produced--how it
shocked their sublime and tender souls!but they commenced turning this
machine and they kept on turning until the ankles, knees, hips, elbows,
shoulders and wrists were all dislocated and the victim was red with the
sweat of agony, and they had standing by a physician to feel the pulse,
so that the last faint flutter of life would not leave his veins.simply that they might
have the pleasure of racking him once again.That is the spirit, and it
is a spirit born of the doctrine that there is upon the throne of the
universe a being who will eternally damn his children, and they said:
"If God is going to have the supreme happiness of burning them forever,
certainly he might not to begrudge to us the joy of burning them for an
hour or two."That was their doctrine, and when I read these things it
seems to me that I have suffered them myself.An Awful Admission

Just think of going to the day of judgment, if there is one, and
standing up before God and admitting without a blush that you had lived
and died a Scotch Presbyterian.I would expect the next sentence would
be, "Depart ye curged into everlasting fire."CHURCHES AND PRIESTS




195.The Church Forbids Investigation

The first doubt was the womb and cradle of progress, and from the first
doubt, man has continued to advance.Men began to investigate, and the
church began to oppose.The astronomer scanned the heavens, while the
church branded his grand forehead with the word, "Infidel;" and now,
not a glittering star in all the vast expanse bears a Christian name.In spite of all religion, the geologist penetrated the earth, read her
history in books of stone, and found, hidden within her bosom souvenirs
of all the ages.The Church Charges Falsely

Notwithstanding the fact that infidels in all ages have battled for
the rights of man, and have at all times been the fearless advocates
of liberty and justice, we are constantly charged by the Church with
tearing down without building again.The Church in the "Dark Ages"

During that frightful period known as the "Dark Ages," Faith reigned,
with scarcely a rebellious subject.Her temples were "carpeted with
knees," and the wealth of nations adorned her countless shrines.The
great painters prostituted their genius to immortalize her vagaries,
while the poets enshrined them in song.At her bidding, man covered the
earth with blood.The scales of Justice were turned with her gold, and
for her use were invented all the cunning instruments of pain.She built
cathedrals for God, and dungeons for men.She peopled the clouds with
angels and the earth with slaves.For ages, a deadly conflict has been waged between a few brave men and
women of thought and genius upon the one side, and the great ignorant
religious mass on the other.The few have appealed to reason, to honor, to law, to freedom, to the
known, and to happiness here in this world.The many have appealed
to prejudice, to fear, to miracle, to slavery, to the unknown, and
to misery hereafter.The many have said,
"Believe!"The Church and the Tree of Knowledge

The gods dreaded education and knowledge then just as they do now.The
church still faithfully guards the dangerous tree of knowledge, and has
exerted in all ages her utmost power to keep mankind from eating the
fruit thereof.The priests have never ceased repeating the old falsehood
and the old threat: "Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it,
lest ye die."Let the church, or one of its
intellectual saints, perform a miracle, and we will believe.We are told
that nature has a superior.Let this superior, for one single instant,
control nature and we will admit the truth of your assertions.The Heretics Cried, "Halt!"A few infidels--a few heretics cried, "Halt!"to the great rabble of
ignorant devotion, and made it possible for the genius of the nineteenth
century to revolutionize the cruel creeds and superstitions of mankind.The World not so Awful Flat

According to the Christian system this world was the centre of
everything.The stars were made out of what little God happened to have
left when he got the world done.God lived up in the sky, and they said
this earth must rest upon something, and finally science passed its hand
clear under, and there was nothing.It was self-existent in infinite
space.Then the Church began to say they didn't say it was flat, not so
awful flat--it was kind of rounding.According to the ancient Christians God lived from all eternity, and
never worked but six days in His whole life, and then had the impudence
to tell us to be industrious.Christian nations are the warlike nations of this world.Christians have
invented the most destructive weapons of war.Christianity gave us the
revolver, invented the rifle, made the bombshell; and Christian
nations here and there had above all other arts the art of war; and as
Christians they have no respect for the rights of barbarians or for the
rights of any nation or tribe that happens to differ with them.See what
it does in our society; we are divided off into little sects that used
to discuss these questions with fire and sword, with chain and <DW19>,
and that discuss, some of them, even to-day, with misrepresentation and
slander.Every day something happens to show me that the old spirit that
that was in the inquisition still slumbers in the breasts of men.Another Day of Divine Work

I heard of a man going to California over the plains, and there was a
clergyman on board, and he had a great deal to say, and finally he
fell in conversation with the forty-niner, and the latter said to the
clergyman, "Do you believe that God made this world in six days?"They were then going along the Humboldt.Says he, "Don't you think
he could put in another day to advantage right around here?"The Donkey and the Lion

Owing to the attitude of the churches for the last fifteen hundred
years, truth-telling has not been a very lucrative business.As a rule,
hypocrisy has worn the robes, and honesty the rags.You cannot now answer the argument of a man by pointing at
the holes in his coat.Thomas Paine attacked the Church when it was
powerful--when it had what is called honors to bestow--when it was
the keeper of the public conscience--when it was strong and cruel.The
Church waited till he was dead, and then attacked his reputation and his
clothes.Once upon a time a donkey kicked a lion, but the lion was dead.The Orthodox Christian

The highest type of the orthodox Christian does not forget; neither
does he learn.He is a living fossil
embedded in that rock called faith.He makes no effort to better his
condition, because all his strength is exhausted in keeping other people
from improving theirs.The supreme desire of his heart is to force all
others to adopt his creed, and in order to accomplish this object he
denounces free-thinking as a crime, and this crime he calls heresy.When
he had power, heresy was the most terrible and formidable of words.It
meant confiscation, exile, imprisonment, torture, and death.Alms-Dish and Sword

I will not say the Church has been an unmitigated evil in all respects.It has delighted in the production
of extremes.It has furnished murderers for its own martyrs.It has
sometimes fed the body, but has always starved the soul.It has been a
charitable highwayman--a profligate beggar--a generous pirate.It
has produced some angels and a multitude of devils.It has built more
prisons than asylums.It made a hundred orphans while it cared for one.In one hand it has carried the alms-dish and in the other a sword.The Church the Great Robber

The Church has been, and still is, the great robber.She has rifled not
only the pockets but the brains of the world.She is the stone at the
sepulchre of liberty; the upas tree, in whose shade the intellect of man
has withered; the Gorgon beneath whose gaze the human heart has turned
to stone.Under her influence even the Protestant mother expects to be
happy in heaven, while her brave boy, who fell fighting for the rights
of man, shall writhe in hell.The Church Impotent

The Church, impotent and malicious, regrets, not the abuse, but the loss
of her power, and seeks to hold by falsehood what she gained by cruelty
and force, by fire and fear.Christianity cannot live in peace with any
other form of faith.Toleration

Let it be remembered that all churches have persecuted heretics to the
extent of their power.Toleration has increased only when and where the
power of the church has diminished.From Augustine until now the
spirit of the Christians has remained the same.There has been the same
intolerance, the same undying hatred of all who think for themselves,
and the same determination to crush out of the human brain all knowledge
inconsistent with an ignorant creed.Shakespeare's Plays v. Sermons

What would the church people think if the theatrical people should
attempt to suppress the churches?What harm would it do to have an opera
here tonight?It would elevate us more than to hear ten thousand sermons
on the worm that never dies.There is more practical wisdom in one of
the plays of Shakespeare than in all the sacred books ever written.What
wrong would there be to see one of those grand plays on Sunday?There
was a time when the church would not allow you to cook on Sunday.You
had to eat your victuals cold.There was a time they thought the more
miserable you feel the better God feels.Give any orthodox church the power, and to-day they would punish heresy
with whip, and chain, and fire.As long as a church deems a certain
belief essential to salvation, just so long it will kill and burn if it
has the power.Why should the Church pity a man whom her God hates?Why
should she show mercy to a kind and noble heretic whom her God will burn
in eternal fire?Cathedrals and domes, and chimes and chants--temples frescoed and
groined and carved, and gilded with gold--altars and tapers, and
paintings of virgin and babe--censer and chalice--chasuble, paten
and alb--organs, and anthems and incense rising to the winged and
blest--maniple, amice and stole--crosses and crosiers, tiaras
and crowns--mitres and missals and masses--rosaries, relics and
robes--martyrs and saints, and windows stained as with the blood of
Christ--never, never for one moment awed the brave, proud spirit of the
Infidel.He knew that all the pomp and glitter had been purchased with
Liberty--that priceless jewel of the soul.In looking at the cathedral
he remembered the dungeon.The music of the organ was loud enough to
drown the clank of fetters.He could not forget that the taper had
lighted the fagot.He knew that the cross adorned the hilt of the sword,
and so where others worshiped, he wept and scorned.Back to Chaos

Suppose the Church could control the world today, we would go back to
chaos and old night philosophy would be branded as infamous; science
would again press its pale and thoughtful face against the prison bars,
and round the limbs of liberty would climb the bigot's flame.Infinite Impudence of the Church

Who can imagine the infinite impudence of a Church assuming to think for
the human race?Who can imagine the infinite impudence of a Church
that pretends to be the mouthpiece of God, and in his name threatens to
inflict eternal punishment upon those who honestly reject its claims and
scorn its pretensions?By what right does a man, or an organization
of men, or a god, claim to hold a brain in bondage?When a fact can be
demonstrated, force is unnecessary; when it cannot be demonstrated, an
appeal to force is infamous.In the presence of the unknown all have an
equal right to think.Wanted!--A New Method

The world is covered with forts to protect Christians from Christians,
and every sea is covered with iron monsters ready to blow Christian
brains into eternal froth.Millions upon millions are annually expended
in the effort to construct still more deadly and terrible engines of
death.Industry is crippled, honest toil is robbed, and even beggary is
taxed to defray the expenses of Christian warfare.There must be some
other way to reform this world.The Kirk of Scotland

The Church was ignorant, bloody, and relentless.In Scotland the "Kirk"
was at the summit of its power.It was a full sister of the Spanish
Inquisition.It was the enemy of
happiness, the hater of joy, and the despiser of religious liberty.It
taught parents to murder their children rather than to allow them to
propagate error.If the mother held opinions of which the infamous
"Kirk" disapproved, her children were taken from her arms, her babe from
her very bosom, and she was not allowed to see them, or to write them a
word.It would not allow shipwrecked sailors to be rescued from drowning
on Sunday.It sought to annihilate pleasure, to pollute the heart by
filling it with religious cruelty and gloom, and to change mankind into
a vast horde of pious, heartless fiends.One of the most famous Scotch
divines said: "The Kirk holds that religious toleration is not far from
blasphemy."The Church Looks Back

The Church is, and always has been, incapable of a forward movement.The Church has already reduced Spain to a
guitar, Italy to a hand-organ, and Ireland to exile.Diogenes

The Church used painting, music and architecture, simply to degrade
mankind.There have been at all
times brave spirits that dared even the gods.Some proud head has always
been above the waves.In every age some Diogenes has sacrificed to all
the gods.True genius never cowers, and there is always some Samson
feeling for the pillars of authority.The Church and War

It does seem as though the most zealous Christian must at times
entertain some doubt as to the divine origin of his religion.For
eighteen hundred years the doctrine has been preached.For more than
a thousand years the Church had, to a great extent, the control of the
civilized world, and what has been the result?Are the Christian nations
patterns of charity and forbearance?On the contrary, their principal
business is to destroy each other.More than five millions of Christians
are trained, educated, and drilled to murder their fellow-christians.Every nation is groaning under a vast debt incurred in carrying on war
against other Christians.The Call to Preach

An old deacon, wishing to get rid of an unpopular preacher, advised him
to give up the ministry and turn his attention to something else.The
preacher replied that he could not conscientiously desert the pulpit, as
he had had a "call" to the ministry.To which the deacon replied, "That
may be so, but it's very unfortunate for you, that when God called you
to preach, he forgot to call anybody to hear you."Burning Servetus

The maker of the Presbyterian creed caused the fugitive Servetus to be
arrested for blasphemy.He was
convicted and condemned to death by fire.On the morning of the fatal
day, Calvin saw him, and Servetus, the victim, asked forgiveness of
Calvin, the murderer.Servetus was bound to the stake, and the <DW19>s
were lighted.The wind carried the flames somewhat away from his body,
so that he slowly roasted for hours.Vainly he implored a speedy death.At last the flames climbed round his form; through smoke and fire his
murderers saw a white, heroic face.And there they watched until a man
became a charred and shriveled mass.Liberty was banished from Geneva,
and nothing but Presbyterianism was left.Freedom for the Clergy

One of the first things I wish to do is to free the orthodox clergy.I
am a great friend of theirs, and in spite of all they may say against
me, I am going to do them a great and lasting service.Upon their necks
are visible the marks of the collar, and upon their backs those of the
lash.They are not allowed to read and think for themselves.They are
taught like parrots, and the best are those who repeat, with the fewest
mistakes, the sentences they have been taught.They sit like owls upon
some dead limb of the tree of knowledge, and hoot the same old hoots
that have been hooted for eighteen hundred years.The Pulpit Weakening

There was a time when a falsehood, fulminated from the pulpit, smote
like a sword; but, the supply having greatly exceeded the demand,
clerical misrepresentation has at last become almost an innocent
amusement.Remembering that only a few years ago men, women, and even
children, were imprisoned, tortured and burned, for having expressed
in an exceedingly mild and gentle way, the ideas entertained by me, I
congratulate myself that calumny is now the pulpit's last resort.Origin of the Priesthood

This was the origin of the priesthood.The priest pretended to stand
between the wrath of the gods and the helplessness of man.He was man's
attorney at the court of heaven.He carried to the invisible world a
flag of truce, a protest and a request.He came back with a command,
with authority and with power.Man fell upon his knees before his own
servant, and the priest, taking advantage of the awe inspired by his
supposed influence with the gods, made of his fellow-man a cringing
hypocrite and slave.The Clergy on Heaven

The clergy, however, balance all the real ills of this life with the
expected joys of the next.We are assured that all is perfection in
heaven--there the skies are cloudless--there all is serenity and peace.Here empires may be overthrown; dynasties may be extinguished in blood;
millions of slaves may toil 'neath the fierce rays of the sun, and the
cruel strokes of the lash; yet all is happiness in heaven.Pestilences
may strew the earth with corpses of the loved; the survivors may bend
above them in agony--yet the placid bosom of heaven is unruffled.Children may expire vainly asking for bread; babes may be devoured by
serpents, while the gods sit smiling in the clouds.The Parson, the Crane and the Fish

A devout clergyman sought every opportunity to impress upon the mind
of his son the fact, that God takes care of all his creatures; that the
falling sparrow attracts his attention, and that his loving-kindness is
over all his works.Happening, one day, to see a crane wading in quest
of food, the good man pointed out to his son the perfect adaptation of
the crane to get his living in that manner."See," said he, "how his
legs are formed for wading!Observe how
nicely he folds his feet when putting them in or drawing them out of
the water!He is thus enabled
to approach the fish without giving them any notice of his arrival.My son," said he, "it is impossible to look at that bird without
recognizing the design, as well as the goodness of God, in thus
providing the means of subsistence.""Yes," replied the boy, "I think I
see the goodness of God, at least so far as the crane is concerned; but,
after all, father, don't you think the arrangement a little tough on the
fish?"Give me the storm of tempest and action, rather than the dead calm of
ignorance and faith.Banish me from Eden when you will; but first let me
eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge!The Pulpit's Cry of Fear

From every pulpit comes the same cry, born of the same fear: "Lest
they eat and become as gods, knowing good and evil."For this reason,
religion hates science, faith detests reason, theology is the sworn
enemy of philosophy, and the church with its flaming sword still guards
the hated tree, and like its supposed founder, curses to the lowest
depths the brave thinkers who eat and become as gods.Restive Clergymen

Some of the clergy have the independence to break away, and the
intellect to maintain themselves as free men, but the most are compelled
to submit to the dictation of the orthodox, and the dead.They are
not employed to give their thoughts, but simply to repeat the ideas of
others.They are not expected to give even the doubts that may suggest
themselves, but are required to walk in the narrow, verdureless path
trodden by the ignorance of the past.The forests and fields on either
side are nothing to them.The Parson Factory at Andover

They have in Massachusetts, at a place called Andover, a kind of
minister-factory; and every professor in that factory takes an oath once
in every five years--that is as long as an oath will last--that not only
has he not during the last five years, but so help him God, he will not
during the next five years intellectually advance; and probably there is
no oath he could easier keep.Since the foundation of that institution
there has not been one case of perjury.They believe the same creed they
first taught when the foundation stone was laid, and now when they send
out a minister they brand him as hardware from Sheffield and Birmingham.And every man who knows where he was educated knows his creed, knows
every argument of his creed, every book that he reads, and just what he
amounts to intellectually, and knows he will shrink and shrivel.A Charge to Presbyteries

Go on, presbyteries and synods, go on!Thrust the heretics out of the
Church--that is to say, throw away your brains,--put out your eyes.Every
deserter from your camp is a recruit for the army of progress.Cling to
the ignorant dogmas of the past; read the 109th Psalm; gloat over the
slaughter of mothers and babes; thank God for total depravity; shower
your honors upon hypocrites, and silence every minister who is touched
with that heresy called genius.Turn out the
astronomers, the geologists, the naturalists, the chemists, and all the
honest scientists.With a whip of scorpions, drive them all out.Nature the True Bible

The true Bible appeals to man in the name of demonstration.It has no fear of being read, of being contradicted,
of being investigated and understood.It does not pretend to be holy, or
sacred; it simply claims to be true.It challenges the scrutiny of
all, and implores every reader to verify every line for himself.It is
incapable of being blasphemed.This book appeals to all the surroundings
of man.Each thing that exists testifies of its perfection.The earth,
with its heart of fire and crowns of snow; with its forests and plains,
its rocks and seas; with its every wave and cloud; with its every leaf
and bud and flower, confirms its every word, and the solemn stars,
shining in the infinite abysses, are the eternal witnesses of its truth.Inspiration

I will tell you what I mean by inspiration.I go and look at the sea,
and the sea says something to me; it makes an impression upon my mind.That impression depends, first, upon my experience; secondly, upon
my intellectual capacity.He has a
different brain, he has had a different experience, he has different
memories and different hopes.The sea may speak to him of joy and to me
of grief and sorrow.The sea cannot tell the same thing to two beings,
because no two human beings have had the same experience.So, when I
look upon a flower, or a star, or a painting, or a statue, the more I
know about sculpture the more that statue speaks to me.The more I have
had of human experience, the more I have read, the greater brain I have,
the more the star says to me.In other words, nature says to me all that
I am capable of understanding.Think of a God wicked and malicious enough to inspire this prayer in
the 109th Psalm.Had this
inspired psalm been found in some temple erected for the worship of
snakes, or in the possession of some cannibal king, written with blood
upon the dried skins of babes, there would have been a perfect harmony
between its surroundings and its sentiments.I Don't Believe the Bible

Now, I read the Bible, and I find that God so loved this world that he
made up his mind to damn the most of us.I have read this book, and what
shall I say of it?I believe it is generally better to be honest.Now,
I don't believe the Bible.They say that if you
do you will regret it when you come to die.If that be true, I know a
great many religious people who will have no cause to regret it--they
don't tell their honest convictions about the Bible.The Bible the Real Persecutor

The Bible was the real persecutor.The Bible burned heretics, built
dungeons, founded the Inquisition, and trampled upon all the liberties
of men.How long, O how long will mankind worship a book?How long will
they grovel in the dust before the ignorant legends of the barbaric
past?How long, O how long will they pursue phantoms in a darkness
deeper than death?Immoralities of the Bible

The believers in the Bible are loud in their denunciation of what they
are pleased to call the immoral literature of the world; and yet few
books have been published containing more moral filth than this inspired
word of God.These stories are not redeemed by a single flash of wit or
humor.They never rise above the dull details of stupid vice.For one,
I cannot afford to soil my pages with extracts from them; and all such
portions of the Scriptures I leave to be examined, written upon, and
explained by the clergy.Clergymen may know some way by which they can
extract honey from these flowers.Until these passages are expunged from
the Old Testament, it is not a fit book to be read by either old or
young.It contains pages that no minister in the United States would
read to his congregation for any reward whatever.There are chapters
that no gentleman would read in the presence of a lady.There are
chapters that no father would read to his child.There are narratives
utterly unfit to be told; and the time will come when mankind will
wonder that such a book was ever called inspired.The Bible Stands in the Way

But as long as the Bible is considered as the work of God, it will be
hard to make all men too good and pure to imitate it; and as long as it
is imitated there will be vile and filthy books.The literature of
our country will not be sweet and clean until the Bible ceases to be
regarded as the production of a god.The Bible False

In the days of Thomas Paine the Church believed and taught that every
word in the Bible was absolutely true.Since his day it has been proven
false in its cosmogony, false in its astronomy, false in its chronology,
false in its history, and so far as the Old Testament is concerned,
false in almost everything.There are but few, if any, scientific men
who apprehend that the Bible is literally true.Who on earth at this
day would pretend to settle any scientific question by a text from
the Bible?The old belief is confined to the ignorant and zealous.The Church itself will before long be driven to occupy the position of
Thomas Paine.The Man I Love

I love any man who gave me, or helped to give me, the liberty I enjoy
to-night.I love every man who helped put our flag in heaven.I love
every man who has lifted his voice in all the ages for liberty, for a
chainless body, and a fetterless brain.I love every man who has given
to every other human being every right that he claimed for himself.I
love every man who thought more of principle than he did of position.I
love the men who have trampled crowns beneath their feet that they might
do something for mankind.Whale, Jonah and All

The best minds of the orthodox world, to-day, are endeavoring to prove
the existence of a personal Deity.You are no longer asked to swallow the Bible whole, whale,
Jonah and all; you are simply required to believe in God, and pay your
pew-rent.There is not now an enlightened minister in the world who will
seriously contend that Samson's strength was in his hair, or that the
necromancers of Egypt could turn water into blood, and pieces of wood
into serpents.Damned for Laughing at Samson

For my part, I would infinitely prefer to know all the results of
scientific investigation, than to be inspired as Moses was.Supposing
the Bible to be true; why is it any worse or more wicked for free
thinkers to deny it, than for priests to deny the doctrine of Evolution,
or the dynamic theory of heat?Why should we be damned for laughing at
Samson and his foxes, while others, holding the Nebular Hypothesis in
utter contempt, go straight to heaven?The Man, Not the Book, Inspired

Now when I come to a book, for instance I read the writings of
Shakespeare--Shakespeare, the greatest human being who ever existed upon
this globe.All that I have sense enough to
understand.Let another read him who knows
nothing of the drama, who knows nothing of the impersonation of passion;
what does he get from him?In other words, every man gets
from a book, a flower, a star, or the sea, what he is able to get from
his intellectual development and experience.Do you then believe that
the Bible is a different book to every human being that receives it?Can God, then, through the Bible, make the same revelation to two
men?Because the man who reads is the man who inspires.Inspiration is in the man and not in the book.The Bible a Chain

The real oppressor, enslaver and corrupter of the people is the Bible.That book is the chain that binds, the dungeon that holds the clergy.That book spreads the pall of superstition over the colleges and
schools.That book puts out the eyes of science, and makes honest
investigation a crime.That book unmans the politician and degrades the
people.That book fills the world with bigotry, hypocrisy and fear.Absurd and Foolish Fables

Volumes might be written upon the infinite absurdity of this most
incredible, wicked and foolish of all the fables contained in that
repository of the impossible, called the Bible.To me it is a matter
of amazement, that it ever was for a moment believed by any intelligent
human being.The Bible the Work of Man

Is it not infinitely more reasonable to say that this book is the work
of man, that it is filled with mingled truth and error, with mistakes
and facts, and reflects, too faithfully perhaps, the "very form and
pressure of its time?"If there are mistakes in the Bible, certainly
they were made by man.If there is anything contrary to nature, it
was written by man.If there is anything immoral, cruel, heartless
or infamous, it certainly was never written by a being worthy of the
adoration of mankind.Something to Admire, not Laugh at

It strikes me that God might write a book that would not necessarily
excite the laughter of his children.In fact, I think it would be
safe to say that a real God could produce a work that would excite the
admiration of mankind.An Intellectual Deformity

The man who now regards the Old Testament as, in any sense, a sacred or
inspired book, is, in my judgment, an intellectual and moral deformity.There is in it so much that is cruel, ignorant, and ferocious, that it
is to me a matter of amazement that it was ever thought to be the work
of a most merciful Deity.The Bible a Poor Product

Admitting that the Bible is the Book of God, is that his only good job?Will not a man be damned as quick for denying the equator as denying
the Bible?Will he not be damned as quick for denying geology as for
denying the scheme of salvation?When the Bible was first written it was
not believed.Had they known as much about science as we know now, that
Bible would not have been written.The Bible the Battle Ground of Sects

Every sect is a certificate that God has not plainly revealed his will
to man.To each reader the Bible conveys a different meaning.About the
meaning of this book, called a revelation, there have been ages of war,
and centuries of sword and flame.If written by an infinite God, he must
have known that these results must follow; and thus knowing, he must be
responsible for all.The Bible Childish

Paine thought the barbarities of the Old Testament inconsistent with
what he deemed the real character of God.He believed that murder,
massacre and indiscriminate slaughter had never been commanded by
the Deity.He regarded much of the Bible as childish, unimportant
and foolish.Paine
attacked the Bible precisely in the same spirit in which he had attacked
the pretensions of kings.All the pomp in the
world could not make him cower.His reason knew no "Holy of Holies,"
except the abode of Truth.Where Moses got the Pentateuch

Nothing can be clearer than that Moses received from the Egyptians the
principal parts of his narrative, making such changes and additions as
were necessary to satisfy the peculiar superstitions of his own people.God's Letter to His Children

According to the theologians, God, the Father of us all, wrote a letter
to his children.The children have always differed somewhat as to the
meaning of this letter.In consequence of these honest differences,
these brothers began to cut out each other's hearts.In every land,
where this letter from God has been read, the children to whom and for
whom it was written have been filled with hatred and malice.They have
imprisoned and murdered each other, and the wives and children of each
other.In the name of God every possible crime has been committed, every
conceivable outrage has been perpetrated.Brave men, tender and loving
women, beautiful girls, and prattling babes have been exterminated in
the name of Jesus Christ.Examination a Crime

The Church has burned honesty and rewarded hypocrisy.And all this,
because it was commanded by a book--a book that men had been taught
implicitly to believe, long before they knew one word that was in it.They had been taught that to doubt the truth of this book--to examine
it, even--was a crime of such enormity that it could not be forgiven,
either in this world or in the next.All that is necessary, as it seems to me, to convince any reasonable
person that the Bible is simply and purely of human invention--of
barbarian invention--is to read it.Read it as you would any other book;
think of it as you would any other; get the bandage of reverence from
your eyes; drive from your heart the phantom of fear; push from the
throne of your brain the cowled form of superstition--then read the Holy
Bible, and you will be amazed that you ever, for one moment, supposed a
being of infinite wisdom, goodness and purity, to be the author of such
ignorance and such atrocity.An Infallible Book Makes Slaves

Whether the Bible is false or true, is of no consequence in comparison
with the mental freedom of the race.Salvation from slavery is inestimable.As long as man
believes the Bible to be infallible, that book is his master.The
civilization of this century is not the child of faith, but of
unbelief--the result of free thought.Can a Sane Man Believe in Inspiration?What man who ever thinks, can believe that blood can appease God?And
yet our entire system of religion is based on that belief.The Jews
pacified Jehovah with the blood of animals, and according to the
Christian system, the blood of Jesus softened the heart of God a little,
and rendered possible the salvation of a fortunate few.It is hard to
conceive how any sane man can read the Bible and still believe in the
doctrine of inspiration.An Inspiration Test

The Bible was originally written in the Hebrew language, and the Hebrew
language at that time had no vowels in writing.It was written entirely
with consonants, and without being divided into chapters and verses, and
there was no system of punctuation whatever.After you go home to-night
write an English sentence or two with only consonants close together,
and you will find that it will take twice as much inspiration to read it
as it did to write it.The Real Bible

The real Bible is not the work of inspired men, nor prophets, nor
evangelists, nor of Christs.The real Bible has not yet been written,
but is being written.Every man who finds a fact adds a word to this
great book.The Bad Passages in the Bible not Inspired

The bad passages in the Bible are not inspired.No God ever upheld
human slavery, polygamy or a war of extermination.No God ever ordered
a soldier to sheathe his sword in the breast of a mother.No God ever
ordered a warrior to butcher a smiling, prattling babe.No God ever said, be subject to the powers that be.No
God ever endeavored to make man a slave and woman a beast of burden.There are thousands of good passages in the Bible.There are in it wise laws, good customs, some lofty and splendid things.And I do not care whether they are inspired or not, so they are true.But what I do insist upon is that the bad is not inspired.Too much Pictorial

There is no hope for you.It is just as bad to deny hell as it is to
deny heaven.The Garden of Eden is pictorial; a pictorial snake and
a pictorial woman, I suppose, and a pictorial man, and may be it was a
pictorial sin.One Plow worth a Million Sermons

Man must learn to rely upon himself.Reading Bibles will not protect
him from the blasts of winter, but houses, fire and clothing will.To
prevent famine one plow is worth a million sermons, and even patent
medicines will cure more diseases than all the prayers uttered since the
beginning of the world.The Infidels of 1776

By the efforts of these infidels--Paine, Jefferson and Franklin--the
name of God was left out of the Constitution of the United States.They
knew that if an infinite being was put in, no room would be left for the
people.They knew that if any church was made the mistress of the state,
that mistress, like all others, would corrupt, weaken, and destroy.Washington wished a church, established by law, in Virginia.He was
prevented by Thomas Jefferson.It was only a little while ago that
people were compelled to attend church by law in the Eastern States,
and taxes were raised for the support of churches the same as for the
construction of highways and bridges.The great principle enunciated
in the Constitution has silently repealed most of these laws.In the
presence of this great instrument the constitutions of the States grew
small and mean, and in a few years every law that puts a chain upon the
mind, except in Delaware, will be repealed, and for these our children
may thank the infidels of 1776.The Legitimate Influence of Religion

Religion should have the influence upon mankind that its goodness, that
its morality, its justice, its charity, its reason and its argument give
it, and no more.Religion should have the effect upon mankind that it
necessarily has, and no more.Infidels the Flowers of the World

The infidels have been the brave and thoughtful men; the flower of all
the world; the pioneers and heralds of the blessed day of liberty and
love; the generous spirits of the unworthy past; the seers and
prophets of our race; the great chivalric souls, proud victors on the
battle-fields of thought, the creditors of all the years to be.The Noblest Sons of, Earth

Who at the present day can imagine the courage, the devotion to
principle, the intellectual and moral grandeur it once required to be an
infidel, to brave the Church, her racks, her fagots, her dungeons, her
tongues of fire--to defy and scorn her heaven and her hell--her devil
and her God?They were the noblest sons of earth.They were the real
saviors of our race, the destroyers of superstition, and the creators
of Science.They were the real Titans who bared their grand foreheads to
all the thunderbolts of all the gods.How Ingersoll became an Infidel

I may say right here that the Christian idea that any God can make me
His friend by killing mine is about as great a mistake as could be made.They seem to have the idea that just as soon as God kills all the people
that a person loves, he will then begin to love the Lord.What drew
my attention first to these questions was the doctrine of eternal
punishment.This was so abhorrent to my mind that I began to hate the
book in which it was taught.Then, in reading law, going back to find
the origin of laws, I found one had to go but a little way before the
legislator and priest united.This led me to study a good many of the
religions of the world.At first I was greatly astonished to find most
of them better than ours.I then studied our own system to the best of
my ability, and found that people were palming off upon children
and upon one another as the inspired words of God a book that upheld
slavery, polygamy, and almost every other crime.Whether I am right or
wrong, I became convinced that the Bible is not an inspired book, and
then the only question for me to settle was as to whether I should say
what I believed or not.This realty was not the question in my mind,
because, before even thinking of such a question, I expressed my belief,
and I simply claim that right, and expect to exercise it as long as I
live.I may be damned for it in the next world, but it is a great source
of pleasure to me in this.Why should it be taken for granted that the men who devoted their lives
to the liberation of their fellowmen should have been hissed at in
the hour of death by the snakes of conscience, while men who defended
slavery--practiced polygamy--justified the stealing of babes from the
breasts of mothers, and lashed the naked back of unpaid labor, are
supposed to have passed smilingly from earth to the embraces of the
angels?Why should we think that the brave thinkers, the investigators,
the honest men must have left the crumbling shore of time in dread and
fear, while the instigators of the massacre of St.Bartholomew, the
inventors and users of thumb screws, of iron boots and racks, the
burners and tearers of human flesh, the stealers, the whippers, and the
enslavers of men, the buyers and beaters of maidens, mothers, and babes,
the founders of the inquisition, the makers of chains, the builders of
dungeons, the calumniators of the living, the slanderers of the
dead, and even the murderers of Jesus Christ, all died in the odor of
sanctity, with white, forgiven hands folded upon the breasts of peace,
while the destroyers of prejudice, the breakers of fetters, the creators
of light, died surrounded by the fierce fiends of God?Infidelity is Liberty

Infidelity is liberty; all religion is slavery.In every creed man is
the slave of God--woman is the slave of man and the sweet children are
the slaves of all.We do not want creeds; we want knowledge--we want
happiness.The World in Debt to Infidels

What would the world be if infidels had never been?Did all the priests of Rome increase the mental wealth of man as much
as Bruno?Did all the priests of France do as great a work for the
civilization of the world as Diderot and Voltaire?Did all the ministers
of Scotland add as much to the sum of human knowledge as David Hume?Have all the clergymen, monks, friars, ministers, priests, bishops,
cardinals, and popes, from the day of Pentecost to the last election,
done as much for human liberty as Thomas Paine?Infidels the Pioneers of Progress

The history of intellectual progress is written in the lives of
infidels.Political rights have been preserved by traitors--the liberty
of the mind by heretics.To attack the king was treason--to dispute the
priest was blasphemy.The throne and the altar were twins--vultures from the same
egg.It was James I. who said: "No bishop, no king."He might have said:
"No cross, no crown."The king owned the bodies, and the priest the
souls, of men.One lived on taxes, the other on alms.One was a robber,
the other a beggar.The king made laws, the priest made creeds.With bowed backs the people
received the burdens of the one, and, with wonder's open mouth, the
dogmas of the other.If any aspired to be free, they were slaughtered by
the king, and every priest was a Herod who slaughtered the children
of the brain.The king ruled by force, the priest by fear, and both by
both.The king said to the people: "God made you peasants, and He made
me king.He made rags and hovels for you, robes and palaces for me.And the priest said: "God made you ignorant and
vile.If you do not obey me, God will punish
you here and torment you hereafter.Infidels the Great Discoverers

Infidels are the intellectual discoverers.They sail the unknown seas,
and in the realms of thought they touch the shores of other worlds.An
infidel is the finder of a new fact--one who in the mental sky has seen
another star.He is an intellectual capitalist, and for that reason
excites the envy of theological paupers.The Altar of Reason

Virtue is a subordination, of the passions to the intellect.It is to
act in accordance with your highest convictions.It does not consist in
believing, but in doing.This is the sublime truth that the Infidels in
all ages have uttered.They have handed the torch from one to the other
through all the years that have fled.Upon the altar of reason they have
kept the sacred fire, and through the long midnight of faith they fed
the divine flame.GODS AND DEVILS




275.Every Nation has Created a God

Each nation has created a God, and the God has always resembled his
creators.He hated and loved what they hated and loved.Each God was
intensely patriotic, and detested all nations but his own.All these
gods demanded praise, flattery and worship.Most of them were pleased
with sacrifice, and the smell of innocent blood has ever been considered
a divine perfume.All these gods have insisted on having a vast number
of priests, and the priests have always insisted upon being supported
by the people; and the principle business of these priests has been
to boast that their God could easily vanquish all the other gods put
together.Gods with Back-Hair

Man, having always been the physical superior of woman, accounts for
the fact that most of the high gods have been males.Had women been the
physical superior; the powers supposed to be the rulers of Nature would
have been woman, and instead of being represented in the apparel of man,
they would have luxuriated in trains, low-necked dresses, laces and
back-hair.Creation the Decomposition of the Infinite

Admitting that a god did create the universe, the question then arises,
of what did he create it?Nothing,
considered in the light of a raw material, is a most decided failure.It
follows, then, that the god must have made the universe out of himself,
he being the only existence.The universe is material, and if it was
made of god, the god must have been material.With this very thought in
his mind, Anaximander of Miletus, said: "Creation is the decomposition
of the infinite."The Gods Are as the People Are

No god was ever in advance of the nation that created him.The <DW64>s
represented their deities with black skins and curly hair: The Mongolian
gave to his a yellow complexion and dark almond-shaped eyes.The Jews
were not allowed to paint theirs, or we should have seen Jehovah with
a full beard, an oval face, and an aquiline nose.Zeus was a perfect
Greek, and Jove looked as though a member of the Roman senate.The gods
of Egypt had the patient face and placid look of the loving people who
made them.The gods of northern countries were represented warmly clad
in robes of fur; those of the tropics were naked.The gods of India
were often mounted upon elephants; those of some islanders were great
swimmers, and the deities of the Arctic zone were passionately fond of
whale's blubber.Gods Shouldn't Make Mistakes

Generally the devotee has modeled them after himself, and has given them
hands, heads, feet, eyes, ears, and organs of speech.Each nation made
its gods and devils not only speak its language, but put in their mouths
the same mistakes in history, geography, astronomy, and in all matters
of fact, generally made by the people.Miracles

No one, in the world's whole history, ever attempted to substantiate a
truth by a miracle.Nothing but
falsehood ever attested itself by signs and wonders.No miracle ever was
performed, and no sane man ever thought he had performed one, and until
one is performed, there can be no evidence of the existence of any power
superior to, and independent of nature.Plenty of Gods on Hand

Man has never been at a loss for gods.He has worshipped almost
everything, including the vilest and most disgusting beasts.He has
worshipped fire, earth, air, water, light, stars, and for hundreds, of
ages prostrated himself before enormous snakes.Savage tribes often make
gods of articles they get from civilized people.The Todas worship
a cowbell.The Kodas worship two silver plates, which they regard as
husband and wife, and another tribe manufactured a god out of a king of
hearts.The Devil Difficulty

In the olden times the existence of devils was universally admitted.The
people had no doubt upon that subject, and from such belief it followed
as a matter of course, that a person, in order to vanquish these devils,
had either to be a god, or to be assisted by one.All founders of
religions have established their claims to divine origin by controlling
evil spirits, and suspending the laws of nature.Casting out devils was
a certificate of divinity.A prophet, unable to cope with the powers of
darkness, was regarded with contempt.The utterance of the highest and
noblest sentiments, the most blameless and holy life, commanded but
little respect, unless accompanied by power to work miracles and command
spirits.If he was God, of course
the devil knew that fact, and yet, according to this account, the devil
took the omnipotent God and placed him upon a pinnacle of the temple,
and endeavored to induce him, to dash himself against the earth.Failing
in that, he took the creator, owner and governor of the universe up into
an exceeding high mountain, and offered him this world--this grain of
sand--if he, the God of all the worlds, would fall down and worship
him, a poor devil, without even a tax title to one foot of dirt!Is it
possible the devil was such an idiot?Should any great credit be given
to this deity for not being caught with such chaff?The
devil--the prince of sharpers--the king of cunning--the master of
finesse, trying to bribe God with a grain of sand that belonged to God!Industrious Deities

Few nations have been so poor as to have but one god.Gods were made
so easily, and the raw material cost so little, that generally the god
market was fairly glutted, and heaven crammed with these phantoms.These
gods not only attended to the skies, but were supposed to interfere in
all the affairs of men.All was supposed to be under their
immediate control.Nothing was too small--nothing too large; the falling
of sparrows and the motions of the planets were alike attended to by
these industrious and observing deities.God in Idleness

If a god created the universe, then, there must have been a time when he
commenced to create.Back of that time there must have been an eternity,
during which there had existed nothing--absolutely nothing--except this
supposed god.According to this theory, this god spent an eternity, so
to speak, in an infinite vacuum, and in perfect idleness.Fancy a Devil Drowning a World

One of these gods, according to the account, drowned an entire world,
with the exception of eight persons.The old, the young, the beautiful
and the helpless were remorselessly devoured by the shoreless sea.This,
the most fearful tragedy that the imagination of ignorant priests ever
conceived, was the act, not of a devil, but of a god, so-called, whom
men ignorantly worship unto this day.What a stain such an act would
leave upon the character of a devil!Some Gods Very Particular About Little Things

From their starry thrones they frequently came to the earth for the
purpose of imparting information to man.It is related of one that he
came amid thunderings and lightnings in order to tell the people that
they should not cook a kid in its mother's milk.Some left their shining
abodes to tell women that they should, or should not, have children, to
inform a priest how to cut and wear his apron, and to give directions as
to the proper manner of cleaning the intestines of a bird.288 The Gods of To-day the Scorn of To-morrow

Nations, like individuals, have their periods of youth, of manhood and
decay.The same inexorable destiny awaits them
all.The gods created by the nations must perish with their creators.They were created by men, and like men, they must pass away.The deities
of one age are the by-words of the next.No Evidence of a God in Nature

The best minds, even in the religious world, admit that in the material
nature there is no evidence of what they are pleased to call a god.They find their evidence in the phenomena of intelligence, and very
innocently assert that intelligence is above, and in fact, opposed to
nature.They insist that man, at least, is a special creation; that
he has somewhere in his brain a divine spark, a little portion of the
"Great First Cause."They say that matter cannot produce thought; but
that thought can produce matter.They tell us that man has intelligence,
and therefore there must be an intelligence greater than his.Why not
say, God has intelligence, therefore there must be an intelligence
greater than his?So far as we know, there is no intelligence apart
from matter.We cannot conceive of thought, except as produced within a
brain.Great Variety in Gods

Gods have been manufactured after numberless models., and according to
the most grotesque fashions.Some have a thousand arms, some a hundred
heads, some are adorned with necklaces of living snakes, some are armed
with clubs, some with sword and shield, some with bucklers, and some
have wings as a cherub; some were invisible, some would show themselves
entire, and some would only show their backs; some were jealous, some
were foolish, some turned themselves into men, some into swans, some
into bulls, some into doves, and some into Holy-Ghosts, and made love
to the beautiful daughters of men: Some were married--all ought to have
been--and some were considered as old bachelors from all eternity.Some
had children, and the children were turned into gods and worshiped as
their fathers had been.Most of these gods were revengeful, savage,
lustful, and ignorant.As they generally depended upon their priests for
information, their ignorance can hardly excite our astonishment.God Grows Smaller

"But," says the religionist, "you cannot explain everything; and that
which you cannot explain, that which you do not comprehend, is my God."We are understanding more every day;
consequently your God is growing smaller every day.Give the Devil His Due

If the account given in Genesis is really true, ought we not, after all,
to thank this serpent?He was the first schoolmaster, the first advocate
of learning, the first enemy of ignorance, the first to whisper in human
ears the sacred word liberty, the creator of ambition, the author of
modesty, of inquiry, of doubt, of investigation, of progress and of
civilization.Casting out Devils

Even Christ, the supposed son of God, taught that persons were possessed
of evil spirits, and frequently, according to the account, gave proof of
his divine origin and mission by frightening droves of devils out of his
unfortunate countrymen.Casting out devils was his principal employment,
and the devils thus banished generally took occasion to acknowledge him
as the true Messiah; which was not only very kind of them, but quite
fortunate for him.On the Horns of a Dilemma

The history of religion is simply the story of man's efforts in all ages
to avoid one of two great powers, and to pacify the other.Both powers
have inspired little else than abject fear.The cold, calculating sneer
of the devil, and the frown of God, were equally terrible.In any event,
man's fate was to be arbitrarily fixed forever by an unknown power
superior to all law, and to all fact.The Devil and the Swine

How are you going to prove a miracle?How would you go to work to prove
that the devil entered into a drove of swine?Who saw it, and who would
know a devil if he did see him?Some tell me that it is the desire of God that I should worship Him?If he is in want and I can assist Him and will
not, I would be an ingrate and an infamous wretch.But I am satisfied
that I cannot by any possibility assist the infinite.I can help feed the hungry, clothe the naked, enlighten
ignorance.I can help at least, in some degree, toward covering this
world with a mantle of joy I may be wrong, but I do not believe that
there is any being in this universe who gives rain for praise, who gives
sunshine for prayer, or who blesses a man simply because he kneels.If the infinite "Father" allows a majority of his children to live in
ignorance and wretchedness now, what evidence is there that he will ever
improve their condition?Can the conduct
of infinite wisdom, power and love ever change?Is the infinite capable
of any improvement whatever?According to the theologians, God prepared this globe expressly for the
habitation of his loved children, and yet he filled the forests with
ferocious beasts; placed serpents in every path; stuffed the world
with earthquakes, and adorned its surface with mountains of flame.Notwithstanding all this, we are told that the world is perfect; that
it was created by a perfect being, and is therefore necessarily perfect.The next moment, these same persons will tell us that the world was
cursed; covered with brambles, thistles and thorns, and that man was
doomed to disease and death, simply because our poor, dear mother ate an
apple contrary to the command of an arbitrary God.The Devils better than the Gods

Our ancestors not only had their God-factories, but they made devils
as well.These devils were generally disgraced and fallen gods.These
devils generally sympathized with man.In nearly all the theologies,
mythologies and religions, the devils have been much more humane and
merciful than the gods.No devil ever gave one of his generals an order
to kill children and to rip open the bodies of pregnant women.Such
barbarities were always ordered by the good gods!The pestilences were
sent by the most merciful gods!The frightful famine, during which the
dying child with pallid lips sucked the withered bosom of a dead
mother, was sent by the loving gods.No devil was ever charged with such
fiendish brutality.Is it possible that an infinite God created this world simply to be the
dwelling-place of slaves and serfs?simply for the purpose of raising
orthodox Christians?That he did a few miracles to astonish them; that
all the evils of life are simply his punishments, and that he is finally
going to turn heaven into a kind of religious museum filled with Baptist
barnacles, petrified Presbyterians and Methodist mummies?I want no
heaven for which I must give my reason; no happiness in exchange for
my liberty, and no immortality that demands the surrender of my
individuality.Better rot in the windowless tomb, to which there is no
door but the red mouth of the pallid worm, than wear the jeweled collar
even of a god.It is impossible to conceive of a more thoroughly despicable, hateful,
and arrogant being, than the Jewish god.In the mythology of the world he has no parallel.He, only, is
never touched by agony and tears.He cares neither for love nor music,
beauty nor joy.A false friend, an unjust judge, a braggart, hypocrite,
and tyrant.Compared with Jehovah, Pharaoh was a benefactor, and the
tyranny of Egypt was freedom to those who suffered the liberty of God.HEAVEN AND HELL




302.Hope of a Future Life

For my part I know nothing of any other state of existence, either
before or after this, and I have never become personally acquainted with
anybody who did.There may be another life, and if there is the best
way to prepare for it is by making somebody happy in this.God certainly
cannot afford to put a man in hell who has made a little heaven in this
world.I would like to see how things come
out in this world when I am dead.There are some people I should like to
see again, but if there is no other life I shall never know it.I am Immortal

So far as I am concerned I am immortal; that is to say, I can't
recollect when I did not exist, and there never will be a time when I
will remember that I do not exist.I would like to have several millions
of dollars, and I may say I have a lively hope that some day I may be
rich; but to tell you the truth I have very little evidence of it.Our
hope of immortality does not come from any religions, but nearly all
religions come from that hope.The Old Testament, instead of telling
us that we are immortal, tells us how we lost immortality.You will
recollect that if Adam and Eve could have gotten to the tree of life,
they would have eaten of its fruit and would have lived forever; but for
the purpose of preventing immortality God turned them out of the Garden
of Eden, and put certain angels with swords or sabres at the gate to
keep them from getting back.The Old Testament proves, if it proves
anything, which I do not think it does, that there is no life after
this; and the New Testament is not very specific on the subject.There
were a great many opportunities for the Savior and his apostles to
tell us about another world, but they didn't improve them to any great
extent; and the only evidence so far as I know about another life is,
first, that we have no evidence; and, secondly, that we are rather sorry
that we have not, and wish we had.And suppose, after all, that death does end all.Next to eternal joy,
next to being forever with those we love and those who have loved us,
next to that is to be wrapped in the dreamless drapery of eternal peace.Upon the shadowy shore of death
the sea of trouble casts no wave.Eyes that have been curtained by the
everlasting dark will never know again the touch of tears.Lips that
have been touched by the eternal silence will never utter another word
of grief.And I had
rather think of those I have loved, and those I have lost, as having
returned to earth, as having become a part of the elemental wealth of
the the world.I would rather think of them as unconscious dust.I would
rather think of them as gurgling in the stream, floating in the cloud,
bursting into light upon the shores of worlds.I would rather think
of them thus than to have even a suspicion that their souls had been
clutched by an orthodox God.The Old World Ignorant of Destiny

Moses differed from most of the makers of sacred books by his failure
to say anything of a future life, by failing to promise heaven, and to
threaten hell.Upon the subject of a future state, there is not one
word in the Pentateuch.Probably at that early day God did not deem
it important to make a revelation as to the eternal destiny of man.He seems to have thought that he could control the Jews, at least, by
rewards and punishments in this world, and so he kept the frightful
realities of eternal joy and torment a profound secret from the people
of his choice.He thought it far more important to tell the Jews their
origin than to enlighten them as to their destiny.Where the Doctrine of Hell was born

I honestly believe that the doctrine of hell was born in the glittering
eyes of snakes that run in frightful coils watching for their prey.I
believe it was born in the yelping and howling and growling and snarling
of wild beasts.I believe it was born in the grin of hyenas and in the
malicious clatter of depraved apes.I despise it, I defy it, and I hate
it; and when the great ship freighted with the world goes down in
the night of death, chaos and disaster, I will not be guilty of the
ineffable meanness of pushing from my breast my wife and children and
paddling off in some orthodox canoe.I will go down with those I love
and with those who love me.I will go down with the ship and with my
race.Nothing can make me believe that there is any being that is going to
burn and torment and damn his children forever.The Grand Companionships of Hell

Since hanging has got to be a means of grace, I would prefer hell.I had
a thousand times rather associate with the pagan philosophers than with
the inquisitors of the middle ages.I certainly should prefer the worst
man in Greek or Roman history to John Calvin, and I can imagine no man
in the world that I would not rather sit on the same bench with than the
puritan fathers and the founders of orthodox churches.I would trade off
my harp any minute for a seat in the other country.All the poets will
be in perdition, and the greatest thinkers, and, I should think, most
of the women whose society would tend to increase the happiness of
man, nearly all the painters, nearly all the sculptors, nearly all
the writers of plays, nearly all the great actors, most of the best
musicians, and nearly all the good fellows--the persons who know good
stories, who can sing songs, or who will loan a friend a dollar.They will mostly all be in that country, and if I did not live there
permanently, I certainly would want it so I could spend my winter months
there.Let me put one case and I will be through with this branch of the
subject.The husband is a good
fellow and the wife a splendid woman.They live and love each other and
all at once he is taken sick, and they watch day after day and night
after night around his bedside until their property is wasted and
finally she has to go to work, and she works through eyes blinded with
tears, and the sentinel of love watches at the bedside of her prince,
and at the least breath or the least motion she is awake; and she
attends him night after night and day after day for years, and finally
he dies, and she has him in her arms and covers his wasted face with the
tears of agony and love.He dies, and
she buries him and puts flowers above his grave, and she goes there in
the twilight of evening and she takes her children, and tells her little
boys and girls through her tears how brave and how true and how tender
their father was, and finally she dies and goes to hell, because she was
not a believer; and he goes to the battlements of heaven and looks over
and sees the woman who loved him with all the wealth of her love, and
whose tears made his dead face holy and sacred, and he looks upon her
in the agonies of hell without having his happiness diminished in the
least.With all due respect to everybody I say, damn any such doctrine
as that.The Drama of Damnation

When you come to die, as you look back upon the record of your life, no
matter how many men you have wrecked and ruined, and no matter how many
women you have deceived and deserted--all that may be forgiven you;
but if you recollect that you have laughed at God's book you will see
through the shadows of death, the leering looks of fiends and the forked
tongues of devils.For instance, it
is the day of judgment.When the man is called up by the recording
secretary, or whoever does the cross-examining, he says to his soul:
"Where are you from?""Well, I don't like to talk about myself.""Well, I was a good fellow; I loved
my wife; I loved my children.My home was my heaven; my fireside was my
paradise, and to sit there and see the lights and shadows falling on the
faces of those I love, that to me was a perpetual joy.I never gave one
of them a solitary moment of pain.I don't owe a dollar in the world,
and I left enough to pay my funeral expenses and keep the wolf of want
from the door of the house I loved.That is the kind of a man I am."They were always expecting to be happy simply because somebody else was
to be damned.""Well, did you believe that rib story?"To tell you the
God's truth, that was a little more than I could swallow.""Yes, sir, and to the Young Men's Christian
Association.""Did you
ever run off with any of the money?""I don't like to tell, sir.""What kind of a bank did you have?""How much did you
run off with?""Did you take anything
else along with you?""Did you have a wife and children of your own?""Oh, yes; but such was my confidence in God that I
believed he would take care of them."I believed all of it, sir; I often used to be sorry that there were
not harder stories yet in the Bible, so that I could show what my faith
could do."Annihilation rather than be a God

No God has a right to make a man he intends to drown.Eternal wisdom has
no right to make a poor investment, no right to engage in a speculation
that will not finally pay a dividend.No God has a right to make
a failure, and surely a man who is to be damned forever is not a
conspicuous success.Yet upon love's breast, the Church has placed that
asp; around the child of immortality the Church has coiled the worm that
never dies.For my part I want no heaven, if there is to be a hell.I
would rather be annihilated than be a god and know that one human soul
would have to suffer eternal agony."All that have Red Hair shall be Damned."I admit that most Christians are honest--always have admitted it.I
admit that most ministers are honest, and that they are doing the best
they can in their way for the good of mankind; but their doctrines are
hurtful; they do harm in the world; and I am going to do what I can
against their doctrines.They preach this infamy: "He that believes
shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned."Every word
of that text has been an instrument of torture; every letter in that
text has been a sword thrust into the bleeding and quivering heart of
man; every letter has been a dungeon; every line has been a chain; and
that infamous sentence has covered this world with blood.I deny that
"whoso believes shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be
damned."No man can control his belief; you might as well say, "All that
have red hair shall be damned."The Conscience of a Hyena

But, after all, what I really want to do is to destroy the idea of
eternal punishment.That
doctrine fills hell with honest men, and heaven with intellectual and
moral paupers.That doctrine allows people to sin on a credit.That
doctrine allows the basest to be eternally happy and the most honorable
to suffer eternal pain.I think of all doctrines it is the most
infinitely infamous, and would disgrace the lowest savage, and any man
who believes it, and has imagination enough to understand it, has the
heart of a serpent and the conscience of a hyena.I Leave the Dead

But for me I leave the dead where nature leaves them, and whatever
flower of hope springs up in my heart I will cherish.But I cannot
believe that there is any being in this universe who has created a
soul for eternal pain, and I would rather that every God would destroy
himself, I would rather that we all should go back to the eternal chaos,
to the black and starless night, than that just one soul should suffer
eternal agony.Swedenborg did one thing for which I feel almost grateful.He gave an
account of having met John Calvin in hell.Nothing connected with the
supernatural could be more natural than this.The only thing detracting
from the value of this report is, that if there is a hell, we know
without visiting the place that John Calvin must be there.GOVERNING GREAT MEN




315.Jesus Christ

And let me say here once for all, that for the man Christ I have
infinite respect.Let me say once for all that the place where man has
died for man is holy ground.Let me say once for all, to that great and
serene man I gladly pay--I _gladly_ pay the tribute of my admiration and
my tears.He was an infidel in his
time.He was regarded as a blasphemer, and his life was destroyed by
hypocrites who have in all ages done what they could to trample freedom
out of the human mind.Had I lived at that time I would have been his
friend.And should he come again he will not find a better friend than
I will be.For the theological creation I have
a different feeling.If he was in fact God, he knew there was no such
thing as death; he knew that what we call death was but the eternal
opening of the golden gates of everlasting joy.And it took no heroism
to face a death that was simply eternal life.The Emperor Constantine, who lifted Christianity into power, murdered
his wife Fausta and his eldest son Crispus the same year that he
convened the council of Nice to decide whether Jesus Christ was a man or
the son of God.The council decided that Christ was substantial with
the Father.We are thus indebted to a wife
murderer for settling the vexed question of the divinity of the Savior.Theodosius called a council at Constantinople in 381, and this council
decided that the Holy Ghost proceeded from the Father.Theodosius,
the younger, assembled another council at Ephesus to ascertain who the
Virgin Mary really was, and it was solemnly decided in the year 431 that
she was the mother of God.In 451 it was decided by a council held at
Chalcedon, called together by the Emperor Marcian, that Christ had two
natures--the human and divine.In 680, in another general council, held
at Constantinople, convened by order of Pognatius, it was also decided
that Christ had two wills, and in the year 1274 it was decided at the
council of Lyons that the Holy Ghost proceeded not only from the Father,
but from the Son as well.Had it not been for these councils we might
have been without a trinity even unto this day.When we take into
consideration the fact that a belief in the trinity is absolutely
essential to salvation, how unfortunate it was for the world that this
doctrine was not established until the year 1274.Think of the millions
that dropped into hell while these questions were being discussed.The church never has pretended that Jefferson or Franklin died in fear.Franklin wrote no books against the fables of the ancient Jews.He
thought it useless to cast the pearls of thought before the swine of
ignorance and fear.He was the father of a
great party.He gave his views in letters and to trusted friends.He
was a Virginian, author of the Declaration of Independence, founder of a
university, father of a political party, President of the United States,
a statesman and philosopher.He was too powerful for the churches of
his day.Paine was a foreigner, a citizen of the world.He had done these things openly, and what
he had said could not be answered.His arguments were so good that his
character was bad.The Emperor, stained with every crime, is supposed to have died like a
Christian.We hear nothing of fiends leering at him in the shadows of
death.He does not see the forms of his murdered wife and son covered
with the blood he shed.From his white and shriveled lips issued no
shrieks of terror.He does not cover his glazed eyes with thin and
trembling hands to shut out the visions of hell.His chamber is filled
with the rustle of wings waiting to bear his soul to the thrilling
realms of joy.Against the Emperor Constantine the church has hurled no
anathema.She has accepted the story of his vision in the clouds, and
his holy memory has been guarded by priest and pope.Diderot

Diderot was born in 1713.His parents were in what may be called the
humbler walks of life.Like Voltaire, he was educated by the Jesuits.He
had in him something of the vagabond, and was for several years almost a
beggar in Paris.He was endeavoring to live by his pen.In that day and
generation a man without a patron, endeavoring to live by literature,
was necessarily almost a beggar.He nearly starved--frequently going
for days without food.Afterward, when he had something himself, he was
generous as the air.No man ever was more willing to give, and no man
less willing to receive, than Diderot.His motto was, "Incredulity
is the first step toward philosophy."He had the vices of most
Christians--was nearly as immoral as the majority of priests.His vices
he shared in common--his virtues were his own--All who knew him united
in saying that he had the pity of a woman, the generosity of a prince,
the self-denial of an anchorite, the courage of Caesar, an insatiate
thirst foi knowledge, and the enthusiasm of a poet.He attacked with
every power of his mind the superstition of his day.He was in favor of universal
education--the church despised it.He wished to put the knowledge of
the whole world within reach of the poorest.He wished to drive from
the gate of the Garden of Eden the cherubim of superstition, so that
the child of Adam might return to eat once more the fruit of the tree
of knowledge.His poor little desk was
ransacked by the police, searching for manuscripts in which something
might be found that would justify the imprisonment of such a dangerous
man.Whoever, in 1750, wished to increase the knowledge of mankind was
regarded as the enemy of social order.Benedict Spinoza

One of the greatest thinkers of the world was Benedict Spinoza--a Jew,
born at Amsterdam in 1638.He asked the rabbis so many questions, and insisted to such a degree on
what he called reason, that his room was preferred to his company.His Jewish brethren excommunicated him from the synagogue.Under the
terrible curse of their religion he was made an outcast from every
Jewish home.His own father could not give him shelter, and his mother,
after the curse had been pronounced, could not give him bread, could not
even speak to him, without becoming an outcast herself.All the cruelty
of Jehovah was in this curse.Spinoza was but twenty-four years old
when he found himself without friends and without kindred.He earned his bread with willing hands, and cheerfully
divided his poor crust with those below.He tried to solve the problem
of existence.According to him the universe did not commence to
be.It is; from eternity it was; and to eternity it will be.He insisted
that God is inside, not outside, of what we call substance.Thomas Paine

Poverty was his mother--Necessity his master.He had more brains than
books; more sense than education; more courage than politeness;
more strength than polish.He had no veneration for old mistakes--no
admiration for ancient lies.He loved the truth for the truth's
sake, and for man's sake.He saw oppression on every hand; injustice
everywhere; hypocrisy at the altar, venality on the bench, tyranny on
the throne; and with a splendid courage he espoused the cause of the
weak against the strong--of the enslaved many against the titled few.The Greatest of all Political Writers

In my judgment, Thomas Paine was the best political writer that ever
lived."What he wrote was pure nature, and his soul and his pen ever
went together."Ceremony, pageantry, and all the paraphernalia of
power, had no effect upon him.He examined into the why and wherefore of
things.He was perfectly radical in his mode of thought.Nothing short
of the bed-rock satisfied him.His enthusiasm for what he believed to
be right knew no bounds.During all the dark scenes of the Revolution,
never for one moment did he despair.Year after year his brave words
were ringing through the land, and by the bivouac fires the weary
soldiers read the inspiring words of "Common Sense," filled with ideas
sharper than their swords, and consecrated themselves anew to the cause
of Freedom.The Writings of Paine

The writings of Paine are gemmed with compact statements that carry
conviction to the dullest.Day and night he labored for America, until
there was a government of the people and for the people.At the close
of the Revolution no one stood higher than Thomas Paine.Had he been
willing to live a hypocrite, he would have been respectable, he at least
could have died surrounded by other hypocrites, and at his death there
would have been an imposing funeral, with miles of carriages, filled
with hypocrites, and above his hypocritical dust there would have been a
hypocritical monument covered with lies.The truth is, he died as he had lived.Some ministers were impolite
enough to visit him against his will.Several of them he ordered
from his room.A couple of Catholic priests, in all the meekness of
hypocrisy, called that they might enjoy the agonies of a dying friend
of man.Thomas Paine, rising in his bed, the few embers of expiring life
blown into flame by the breath of indignation, had the goodness to curse
them both.His physician, who seems to have been a meddling fool, just
as the cold hand of death was touching the patriot's heart, whispered
in the dull ear of the dying man: "Do you believe, or do you wish to
believe, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?"And the reply was: "I
have no wish to believe on that subject."These were the last remembered
words of Thomas Paine.He died as serenely as ever Christian passed
away.He died in the full possession of his mind, and on the very brink
and edge of death proclaimed the doctrines of his life.Paine Believed in God

Thomas Paine was a champion in both hemispheres of human liberty; one of
the founders and fathers of the Republic; one of the foremost men of his
age.He never wrote a word in favor of injustice.He was a despiser of
slavery.He wast in the widest and
best sense, a friend of all his race.His head was as clear as his heart
was good, and he had the courage to speak his honest thought.He was
the first man to write these words: "The United States of America."He furnished every thought
that now glitters in the Declaration of Independence.He believed in one
God and no more.He was a believer even in special providence, and he
hoped for immortality.The Intellectual Hera

Thomas Paine was one of the intellectual heroes--one of the men to whom
we are indebted.His name is associated forever with the Great Republic.As long as free government exists he will be remembered, admired and
honored.He lived a long, laborious and useful life.The world is better
for his having lived.For the sake of truth he accepted hatred and
reproach for his portion.His friends
were untrue to him because he was true to himself, and true to them.He
lost the respect of what is called society, but kept his own.His life
is what the world calls failure and what history calls success.If to
love your fellow-men more than self is goodness, Thomas Paine was good.If to be in advance of your time--to be a pioneer in the direction of
right--is greatness.If to avow your principles and discharge your
duty in the presence of death is heroic, Thomas Paine was a hero.At the
age of seventy-three, death touched his tired heart.He died in the land
his genius defended--under the flag he gave to the skies.Slander cannot
touch him now--hatred cannot reach him more.He sleeps in the sanctuary
of the tomb, beneath the quiet of the stars.Paine, Franklin, Jefferson

In our country there were three infidels--Paine, Franklin and Jefferson.The colonies were full of superstition, the Puritans with the spirit
of persecution.Laws savage, ignorant, and malignant had been passed in
every colony for the purpose of destroying intellectual liberty.The toleration acts of
Maryland tolerated only Christians--not infidels, not thinkers, not
investigators.The charity of Roger Williams was not extended to those
who denied the Bible, or suspected the divinity of Christ.It was not
based upon the rights of man, but upon the rights of believers, who
differed in non-essential points.David Hume

On the 26th of April, 1711, David Hume was born.David Hume was one of
the few Scotchmen of his day who were not owned by the church.He had
the manliness to examine historical and religious questions for himself,
and the courage to give his conclusions to the world.He was singularly
capable of governing himself.He was a philosopher, and lived a calm
and cheerful life, unstained by an unjust act, free from all excess,
and devoted in a reasonable degree to benefiting his fellow-men.After
examining the Bible he became convinced that it was not true.For
failing to suppress his real opinion, for failing to tell a deliberate
falsehood, he brought upon him the hatred of the church.Voltaire

Voltaire was the intellectual autocrat of his time.From his throne at
the foot of the Alps he pointed the finger of scorn at every hypocrite
in Europe.He left the quiver of ridicule without an arrow.He was the
pioneer of his century.Through the
shadows of faith and fable, through the darkness of myth and miracle,
through the midnight of Christianity, through the blackness of bigotry,
past cathedral and dungeon, past rack and stake, past altar and throne,
he carried, with brave and chivalric hands, the torch of reason.John Calvin

Calvin was of a pallid, bloodless complexion, thin, sickly, irritable,
gloomy, impatient, egotistic, tyrannical, heartless, and infamous.He
was a strange compound of revengeful morality, malicious forgiveness,
ferocious charity, egotistic humility, and a kind of hellish justice.In other words, he was as near like the God of the Old Testament as his
health permitted.Calvin's Five Fetters

This man forged five fetters for the brain.That is to say, predestination, particular redemption, total
depravity, irresistible grace, and the perseverance of the saints.About
the neck of each follower he put a collar bristling with these five iron
points.The presence of all these points on the collar is still the test
of orthodoxy in the church he founded.This man, when in the flush of
youth, was elected to the office of preacher in Geneva.He at once,
in union with Farel, drew up a condensed statement of the Presbyterian
doctrine, and all the citizens of Geneva, on pain of banishment, were
compelled to take an oath that they believed this statement.Of this
proceeding Calvin very innocently remarked that it produced great
satisfaction.A man named Caroli had the audacity to dispute with
Calvin.Humboldt

Humboldt breathed the atmosphere of investigation.Old ideas were
abandoned; old creeds, hallowed by centuries, were thrown aside; thought
became courageous; the athlete, Reason, challenged to mortal combat the
monsters of superstition.Humbolt's Travels

Europe becoming too small for his genius, he visited the tropics.He
sailed along the gigantic Amazon--the mysterious Orinoco--traversed the
Pampas--climbed the Andes until he stood upon the crags of Chimborazo,
more than eighteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, and climbed
on until blood flowed from his eyes and lips.For nearly five years he
pursued his investigations in the new world, accompanied by the intrepid
Bonplandi.He was the best intellectual
organ of these new revelations of science.He was calm, reflective and
eloquent; filled with a sense of the beautiful, and the love of truth.His collections were immense, and valuable beyond calculation to every
science.He endured innumerable hardships, braved countless dangers in
unknown and savage lands, and exhausted his fortune for the advancement
of true learning.Humboldt's Illustrious Companions

Humboldt was the friend and companion of the greatest poets, historians,
philologists, artists, statesmen, critics, and logicians of his time.He was the companion of Schiller, who believed that man would be
regenerated through the influence of the Beautiful of Goethe, the grand
patriarch of German literature; of Weiland, who has been called
the Voltaire of Germany; of Herder, who wrote the outlines of a
philosophical history of man; of Kotzebue, who lived in the world of
romance; of Schleiermacher, the pantheist; of Schlegel, who gave to
his countrymen the enchanted realm of Shakespeare; of the sublime Kant,
author of the first work published in Germany on Pure Reason; of Fichte,
the infinite idealist; of Schopenhauer, the European Buddhist who
followed the great Gautama to the painless and dreamless Nirwana, and
of hundreds of others, whose names are familiar to and honored by the
scientific world.Humboldt the Apostle of Science

Upon his return to Europe he was hailed as the second Columbus; as the
scientific discover of America; as the revealer of a new world; as the
great demonstrator of the sublime truth, that the universe is governed
by law.I have seen a picture of the old man, sitting upon a mountain
side--above him the eternal snow--below, the smiling valley of the
tropics, filled with vine and palm; his chin upon his breast, his
eyes deep, thoughtful and calm his forehead majestic--grander than the
mountain upon which he sat--crowned with the snow of his whitened hair,
he looked the intellectual autocrat of this world.Not satisfied with
his discoveries in America, he crossed the steppes of Asia, the wastes
of

Siberia, the great Ural range adding to the knowledge of mankind at
every step.H is energy acknowledged no obstacle, his life knew no
leisure; every day was filled with labor and with thought.He was one
of the apostles of science, and he served his divine master with
a self-sacrificing zeal that knew no abatement; with an ardor that
constantly increased, and with a devotion unwavering and constant as the
polar star.Ingersoll Muses by Napoleon's Tomb

A little while ago I stood by the grave of the old Napoleon--a
magnificent tomb of gilt and gold, fit almost for a dead deity--and
gazed upon the sarcophagus of black Egyptian marble, where rest at last
the ashes of the restless man.I leaned over the balustrade and thought
about the career of the greatest soldier of the modern world.I saw him
walking upon the banks of the Seine, contemplating suicide--I saw him
at Toulon--I saw him putting down the mob in the streets of Paris--I saw
him at the head of the army of Italy--I saw him crossing the bridge of
Lodi with the tri-color in his hand--I saw him in Egypt in the shadows
of the pyramids--I saw him conquer the Alps and mingle the eagles of
France with the eagles of the crags.I saw him at Marengo--at Ulm and
Austerlitz.I saw him in Russia, where the infantry of the snow and the
cavalry of the wild blast scattered his legions like Winter's withered
leaves.I saw him at Leipsic in defeat and disaster--driven by a million
bayonets back upon Paris--clutched like a wild beast--banished to Elba.I saw him escape and retake an empire by the force of his genius.I saw
him upon the frightful field of Waterloo, where chance and fate combined
to wreck the fortunes of their former king.Helena,
with his hands crossed behind him, gazing out upon the sad and solemn
sea.I thought of the orphans and widows he had made--of the tears that
had been shed for his glory, and of the only woman who ever loved him,
pushed from his heart by the cold hand of ambition.And I said I would
rather have been a French peasant, and worn wooden shoes.I would rather
have lived in a hut with a vine growing over the door, and the grapes
growing purple in the kisses of the Autumn sun.I would rather have been
that poor peasant with my loving wife by my side, knitting as the day
died out of the sky--with my children upon my knees and their arms about
me; I would rather have been that man and gone down to the tongueless
silence of the dreamless dust, than to have been that imperial
impersonation of force and murder known as Napoleon the Great.And so I
would, ten thousand times.Eulogy on J. G. Blaine

This is a grand year--a year filled with recollections of the
Revolution; filled with the proud and tender memories of the past; with
the sacred legends of liberty; a year in which the sons of freedom will
drink from the fountains of enthusiasm; a year in which the people call
for a man who has preserved in Congress what our soldiers won upon
the field; a year in which they call for the man who has torn from the
throat of treason the tongue of slander--for the man who has snatched
the mask of Democracy from the hideous face of rebellion; for this man
who, like an intellectual athlete, has stood in the arena of debate and
challenged all comers, and who is still a total stranger to defeat.Like
an armed warrior, like a plumed knight, James G. Blaine marched down the
halls of the American Congress and threw his shining lance full and
fair against the brazen foreheads of the defamers of his country and the
maligners of her honor.For the Republican party to desert this gallant
leader now is as though an army should desert their General upon the
field of battle.James G. Blaine is now and has been for years the
bearer of the sacred standard of the Republican party.A Model Leader

The Republicans of the United States want a man who knows that this
Government should protect every citizen, at home and abroad; who knows
that any Government that will not defend its defenders and protect its
protectors is a disgrace to the map of the world.They demand a man who
believes in the eternal separation and divorcement of church and school.They demand a man whose political reputation is as spotless as a star;
but they do not demand that their candidate shall have a certificate of
moral character signed by a Confederate Congress.The man who has, in
full, heaped and rounded measure, all these splendid qualifications is
the present grand and gallant leader of the Republican party--James G.
Blaine.Our country, crowned with the vast and marvelous achievements
of its first century, asks for a man worthy of the past and prophetic
of her future; asks for a man who has the audacity of genius; asks for
a man who is the grandest combination of heart, conscience and brain
beneath her flag.Such a man is James G. Blaine.Abraham Lincoln

This world has not been fit to live in fifty years.There is no liberty
in it--very little.Why, it is only a few years ago that all the
Christian nations were engaged in the slave trade.It was not until 1808
that England abolished the slave trade, and up to that time her priests
in her churches and her judges on her benches owned stock in slave
ships, and luxuriated on the profits of piracy and murder; and when a
man stood up and denounced it they mobbed him as though he had been a
common burglar or a horse thief.It was not until the 28th
day of August, 1833, that England abolished slavery in her colonies; and
it was not until the 1st day of January, 1862, that Abraham Lincoln, by
direction of the entire North, wiped that infamy out of this country;
and I never speak of Abraham Lincoln but I want to say that he was, in
my judgment, in many respects the grandest man ever President of the
United States.I say that upon his tomb there ought to be this line--and
I know of no other man deserving it so well as he: "Here lies one who
having been clothed with almost absolute power never abused it except on
the side of mercy."Swedenborg

Swedenborg was a man of great intellect, of vast acquirements, and of
honest intentions; and I think it equally clear that upon one subject,
at least, his mind was touched, shattered and shaken.Misled by
analogies, imposed upon by the bishop, deceived by the woman, borne to
other worlds upon the wings of dreams, living in the twilight of reason
and the dawn of insanity, he regarded every fact as a patched and ragged
garment with a lining of the costliest silk, and insisted that the wrong
side, even of the silk, was far more beautiful than the right.Jeremy Bentham

The glory of Bentham is, that he gave the true basis of morals, and
furnished the statesmen with the star and compass of this sentence: "The
greatest happiness of the greatest number."Charles Fourier

Fourier sustained about the same relation to this world that Swedenborg
did to the other.There must be something wrong about the brain of one
who solemnly asserts that "the elephant, the ox and the diamond were
created by the Sun; the horse, the lily, and the ruby, by Saturn; the
cow, the jonquil and the topaz, by Jupiter; and the dog, the violet
and the opal stones by the earth itself."And yet, forgetting these
aberrations of the mind, this lunacy of a great and loving soul, for
one, that's in tender-est regard the memory of Charles Fourier, one of
the best and noblest of our race.Auguste Comte

There was in the brain of the great Frenchman--Auguste Comte--the dawn
of that happy day in which humanity will be the only religion, good the
only God, happiness the only object, restitution the only atonement,
mistake the only sin, and affection guided by intelligence, the only
savior of mankind.This dawn enriched his poverty, illuminated the
darkness of his life, peopled his loneliness with the happy millions yet
to be, and filled his eyes with proud and tender tears.When everything
connected with Napoleon, except his crimes, shall be forgotten, Auguste
Comte will be lovingly remembered as a benefactor of the human race.Herbert Spencer

Herbert Spencer relies upon evidence, upon demonstration, upon
experience; and occupies himself with one world at a time.He perceives
that there is a mental horizon that we cannot pierce, and that beyond
that is the unknown, possibly the unknowable.He endeavors to examine
only that which is capable of being examined, and considers the
theological method as not only useless, but hurtful.After all God is
but a guess, throned and established by arrogance and assertion.Turning his attention to those things that have in some way affected
the condition of mankind, Spencer leaves the unknowable to priests and
believers.Robert Collyer

I have the honor of a slight acquaintance with Robert Collyer.I have
read with pleasure some of his exquisite productions.He has a brain
full of the dawn, the head of a philosopher, the imagination of a poet
and the sincere heart of a child.Had such men as Robert Collyer and
John Stuart Mill been present at the burning of Servetus, they would
have extinguished the flames with their tears.Had the presbytery of
Chicago been there, they would have quietly turned their backs, solemnly
divided their coat tails, and warmed themselves.John Milton

England was filled with Puritan gloom and Episcopal ceremony.All
religious conceptions were of the grossest nature.The ideas of crazy
fanatics and extravagant poets were taken as sober facts.Milton had
clothed Christianity in the soiled and faded finery of the gods--had
added to the story of Christ the fables of Mythology, He gave to the
Protestant Church the most outrageously material ideas of the Deity.He turned all the angels into soldiers--made heaven a battlefield, put
Christ in uniform, and described God as a militia general.His works
were considered by the Protestants nearly as sacred as the Bible
itself, and the imagination of the people was thoroughly polluted by the
horrible imagery, the sublime absurdity of the blind Milton.Ernst Haeckel

Amongst the bravest, side by side with the greatest of the world in
Germany, the land of science--stands Ernst Haeckel, who may be said
not only to have demonstrated the theories of Darwin, but the monistic
conception of the world.He has endeavored--and I think with complete
success--to show that there is not, and never was, and never can be,
the creator of anything.Haeckel is one of the bitterest enemies of the
church, and is, therefore, one of the bravest friends of man.Professor Swing, a Dove amongst Vultures

Professor Swing was too good a man to stay in the Presbyterian Church.He was a rose amongst thistles; he was a dove amongst vultures; and they
hunted him out, and I am glad he came out.I have the greatest respect
for Professor Swing, but I want him to tell whether the 109th Psalm is
inspired.Queen Victoria and George Eliot

Compare George Eliot with Queen Victoria.The Queen is clad in garments
given her by blind fortune and unreasoning chance, while George Eliot
wears robes of glory woven in the loom of her own genius.The time is coming when men will be rated at their real
worth; when we shall care nothing for an officer if he does not fill his
place.Bough on Rabbi Bien

I will not answer Rabbi Bien, and I will tell you why.Because he has
taken himself outside of all the limits of a gentleman; because he has
taken upon himself to traduce American women in language the beastliest
I ever read; and any man who says that the American women are not just
as good women as any God can make, and pick his mind to-day, is an
unappreciative barbarian.I will let him alone because he denounced all
the men in this country, all the members of Congress, all the members
of the Senate, all the Judges on the bench, as thieves and robbers.I
pronounce him a vulgar falsifier, and let him alone.General Garfield

No man has been nominated for the office since I was born, by either
party, who had more brains and more heart than James A. Garfield.He
was a soldier, he is a statesman.In time of peace he preferred the
avocations of peace; when the bugle of war blew in his ears he withdrew
from his work and fought for the flag, and then he went back to the
avocation of peace.And I say to-day that a man who, in a time of
profound peace, makes up his mind that he would like to kill folks for
a living is no better, to say the least of it, than the man who loves
peace in the time of peace, and who, when his country is attacked,
rushes to the rescue of her flag."Wealthy in Integrity; In Brain a Millionaire."James A. Garfield is to-day a poor man, and you know that there is not
money enough in this magnificent street to buy the honor and manhood of
James A. Garfield.Money cannot make such a man, and I will swear to you
that money cannot buy him.James A. Garfield to-day wears the glorious
robe of honest poverty.He is a poor man; but I like to say it here in
Wall street; I like to say it surrounded by the millions of America; I
like to say it in the midst of banks, and bonds, and stocks; I love to
say it where gold is piled--that, although a poor man, he is rich in
honor, in integrity he is wealthy, and in brain he is a millionaire.Garfield a Certificate of the Splendor of the American Constitution

Garfield is a certificate of the splendor of our Government, that says
to every poor boy: "All the avenues of honor are open to you."He is a scholar; he is a statesman; he was a
soldier; he is a patriot; and above all he is a magnificent man, and if
every man in New York knew him as well as I do, Garfield would not lose
a hundred votes in this city.W. Hiram Thomas

The best thing that has come from the other side is from Dr.I
regard him as by far the grandest intellect in the Methodist Church.He
is intellectually a wide and tender man.I cannot conceive of an article
being written in a better spirit.He finds a little fault with me for
not being exactly fair.Thomas
the probability is I never should have laid myself liable to criticism.There is some human nature in me, and I find it exceedingly difficult
to preserve at all times perfect serenity.I have the greatest possible
respect for Dr.Thomas, and must heartily thank him for his perfect
fairness.MISCELLANEOUS




355.Heresy and Orthodoxy

It has always been the man ahead that has been called the heretic.Heresy is the last and best thought always!Heresy extends the
hospitality of the brain to a new idea; that is what the rotting says to
flax growing; that is what the dweller in the swamp says to the man on
the sun-lit hill; that is what the man in the darkness cries out to the
grand man upon whose forehead is shining the dawn of a grander day; that
is what the coffin says to the cradle.Orthodoxy is a kind of shroud,
and heresy is a banner--Orthodoxy is a fog and Heresy a star shining
forever upon the cradle of truth.I do not mean simply in religion, I
mean in everything and the idea I wish to impress upon you is that you
should keep your minds open to all the influences of nature, you should
keep your minds open to reason; hear what a man has to say, and do not
let the turtle-shell of bigotry grow above your brain.Give everybody a
chance and an opportunity; that is all.We used to worship the golden calf, and the worst you can say of us now,
is, we worship the gold of the calf, and even the calves are beginning
to see this distinction.We used to go down on our knees to every man
that held office, now he must fill it if he wishes any respect.We care
nothing for the rich, except what will they do with their money?How does he fill it?--that is the question.And there is rapidly growing
up in the world an aristocracy of heart and brain--the only aristocracy
that has a right to exist.Truth will Bear the Test

If a man has a diamond that has been examined by the lapidaries of the
world, and some ignorant stonecutter told him that it is nothing but
an ordinary rock, he laughs at him; but if it has not been examined
by lapidaries, and he is a little suspicious himself that it is not
genuine, it makes him mad.Any doctrine that will not bear investigation
is not a fit tenant for the mind of an honest man.Any man who is afraid
to have his doctrine investigated is not only a coward but a hypocrite.Paring Nails

Why should we in this age of the world be dominated by the dead?Why
should barbarian Jews who went down to death and dust three thousand
years ago, control the living world?Why should we care for the
superstition of men who began the sabbath by paring their nails,
"beginning at the fourth finger, then going to the second, then to the
fifth, then to the third, and ending with the thumb?"How pleasing to
God this must have been.There may be a God

There may be for aught I know, somewhere in the unknown shoreless vast,
some being whose dreams are constellations and within whose thought the
infinite exists.About this being, if such an one exists, I have nothing
to say.He has written no books, inspired no barbarians, required no
worship, and has prepared no hell in which to burn the honest seeker
after truth.The People are Beginning to Think

The people are beginning to think, to reason and to investigate.Slowly,
painfully, but surely, the gods are being driven from the earth.Only
upon rare occasions are they, even by the most religious, supposed to
interfere in the affairs of men.In most matters we are at last supposed
to be free.Since the invention of steamships and railways, so that the
products of all countries can be easily interchanged, the gods have quit
the business of producing famine.Unchained Thought

For the vagaries of the clouds the infidels propose to substitute the
realities of earth; for superstition, the splendid demonstrations and
achievements of science; and for theological tyranny, the chainless
liberty of thought.Man the Victor of the Future

If abuses are destroyed, man must destroy them.If slaves are freed, man
must free them.If new truths are discovered, man must discover them.If the naked are clothed; if the hungry are fed; if justice is done;
if labor is rewarded; if superstition is driven from the mind; if the
defenseless are protected, and if the right finally triumphs, all must
be the work of man.The grand victories of the future must be won by
man, and by man alone.The Sacred Sabbath

Of all the superstitious of mankind, this insanity about the "sacred
Sabbath" is the most absurd.The idea of feeling it a duty to be solemn
and sad one-seventh of the time!To think that we can please an infinite
being by staying in some dark and sombre room, instead of walking in the
perfumed fields!Why should God hate to see a man happy?Why should it
excite his wrath to see a family in the woods, by some babbling stream,
talking, laughing and loving?Nature works on that "sacred" day.The
earth turns, the rivers run, the trees grow, buds burst into flower, and
birds fill the air with song.Why should we look sad, and think about
death, and hear about-hell?Why should that day be filled with gloom
instead of joy?Make the Sabbath Merry

Freethinkers should make the Sabbath a day of mirth and music; a day to
spend with wife and child--a day of games, and books, and dreams--a day
to put fresh flowers above our sleeping dead--a day of memory and hope,
of love and rest.Away to the Hills and the Sea

A poor mechanic, working all the week in dust and noise, needs a day of
rest and joy, a day to visit stream and wood--a day to live with wife
and child; a day in which to laugh at care, and gather hope and strength
for toils to come.And his weary wife needs a breath of sunny air, away
from street and wall, amid the hills or by the margin of the sea, where
she can sit and prattle with her babe, and fill with happy dreams the
long, glad day.Melancholy Sundays

When I was a little fellow most everybody thought that some days were
too sacred for the young ones to enjoy themselves in.Sunday used to commence Saturday night at sundown, under
the old text, "The evening and the morning were the first day."They
commenced then, I think, to get a good ready.When the sun went down
Saturday night, darkness ten thousand times deeper than ordinary night
fell upon that house.The boy that looked the sickest was regarded as
the most pious.You could not crack hickory nuts that night, and if you
were caught chewing gum it was another evidence of the total depravity
of the human heart.We would sometimes
sing, "Another day has passed."Everybody looked as though they had the
dyspesia--you know lots of people think they are pious, just because
they are bilious, as Mr.It was a solemn night, and the next
morning the solemnity had increased.Then we went to church, and the
minister was in a pulpit about twenty feet high.If it was in the winter
there was no fire; it was not thought proper to be comfortable while you
were thanking the Lord.The minister commenced at firstly and ran up to
about twenty-fourthly, and then he divided it up again; and then he
made some concluding remarks, and then he said lastly, and when he said
lastly he was about half through.Moses took Egyptian Law for his Model

It has been contended for many years that the ten commandments are the
foundation of all ideas of justice and of law.Eminent jurists have
bowed to popular prejudice, and deformed their works by statements to
the effect that the Mosaic laws are the fountains from which sprang all
ideas of right and wrong.Nothing can be more stupidly false than such
assertions.Thousands of years before Moses was born, the Egyptians
had a code of laws.They had laws against blasphemy, murder, adultery,
larceny, perjury, laws for the collection of debts, and the enforcement
of contracts.A False Standard of Success

It is not necessary to be rich, nor powerful, nor great, to be a
success; and neither is it necessary to have your name between the
putrid lips of rumor to be great.We have had a false standard of
success.In the years when I was a little boy we read in our books that
no fellow was a success that did not make a fortune or get a big office,
and he generally was a man that slept about three hours a night.They
never put down in the books the gentlemen who succeeded in life and yet
slept all they wanted to.Toilers and Idlers

You can divide mankind into two classes: the laborers and the idlers,
the supporters and the supported, the honest and the dishonest.Every
man is dishonest who lives upon the unpaid labor of others, no matter
if he occupies a throne.The laborers
should have equal-rights before the world and before the law.And I want
every farmer to consider every man who labors either with hand or brain
as his brother.Until genius and labor formed a partnership there was
no such thing as prosperity among men.Every reaper and mower, every
agricultural implement, has elevated the work of the farmer, and his
vocation grows grander with every invention.In the olden time the
agriculturist was ignorant; he knew nothing of machinery, he was the
slave of superstition.The Sad Wilderness History

While reading the Pentateuch, I am filled with indignation, pity and
horror.Nothing can be sadder than the history of the starved and
frightened wretches who wandered over the desolate crags and sands of
wilderness and desert, the prey of famine, sword and plague.Ignorant
and superstitious to the last degree, governed by falsehood, plundered
by hypocrisy, they were the sport of priests, and the food of fear.God
was their greatest enemy, and death their only friend.Law Much Older than Sinai

Laws spring from the instinct of self-preservation.Industry objected
to supporting idleness, and laws were made against theft.Laws were made
against murder, because a very large majority of the people have always
objected to being murdered.All fundamental laws were born simply of the
instinct of self-defence.Long before the Jewish savages assembled at
the foot of Sinai, laws had been made and enforced, not only in Egypt
and India, but by every tribe that ever existed.God raised the black flag, and
commanded his soldiers to kill even the smiling infant in its mother's
arms.Who is the blasphemer; the man who denies the existence of God, or
he who covers the robes of the infinite with innocent blood?Standing Tip for God

We are told in the Pentateuch that God, the father of us all, gave
thousands of maidens, after having killed their fathers, their mothers,
and their brothers, to satisfy the brutal lusts of savage men.If there
be a God, I pray him to write in his book, opposite my name, that I
denied this lie for him.Matter and Force

The statement in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, I
cannot accept.It is contrary to my reason, and I cannot believe it.It
appears reasonable for me that force has existed from eternity.Force
cannot, as it appears to me, exist apart from matter.Force, in its
nature, is forever active, and without matter it could not act; and so
I think matter must have existed forever.To conceive of matter without
force, or of force without matter, or of a time when neither existed,
or of a being who existed for an eternity without either, and who out of
nothing created both, is to me utterly impossible.It may be that I am led to these conclusions by "total depravity," or
that I lack the necessary humility of spirit to satisfactorily harmonize
Haeckel and Moses; or that I am carried away by pride, blinded by
reason, given over to hardness of heart that I might be damned, but I
never can believe that the earth was covered with leaves, and buds, and
flowers, and fruits, before the sun with glittering spear had driven
back the hosts of night.We are told that God made man; and the question naturally arises, how
was this done?Was it by a process of "evolution," "development;" the
"transmission of acquired habits;" the "survival of the fittest," or was
the necessary amount of clay kneaded to the proper consistency, and then
by the hands of God moulded into form?Modern science tells that man has
been evolved, through countless epochs, from the lower forms; that he
is the result of almost an infinite number of actions, reactions,
experiences, states, forms, wants and adaptations.General Joshua

My own opinion is that General Joshua knew no more about the motions of
the earth than he did mercy and justice.If he had known that the earth
turned upon its axis at the rate of a thousand miles an hour, and swept
in its course about the sun at the rate of sixty-eight thousand miles
an hour, he would have doubled the hailstones, spoken of in the same
chapter, that the Lord cast down from heaven, and allowed the sun and
moon to rise and set in the usual way.This getting up so early in the morning is a relic of barbarism.It has
made hundreds of thousands of young men curse business.There is no need
of getting up at three or four o'clock in the winter morning.The farmer
who persists in dragging his wife and children from their beds ought to
be visited by a missionary.It is time enough to rise after the sun has
set the example.Why
not feed them more the night before?In the old
times they used to get up about three o'clock in the morning, and go to
work long before the sun had risen with "healing upon his wings," and as
a just punishment they all had the ague; and they ought to have it now.Sleep is the best medicine
in the world.There is no such thing as health, without plenty of sleep.When you work, work;
and when you get through take a good, long and refreshing sleep.Never Rise at Four O'Clock

The man who cannot get a living upon Illinois soil without rising before
daylight ought to starve.Eight hours a day is enough for any farmer to
work except in harvest time.When you rise at four and work till dark
what is life worth?Of what use are all the improvements in farming?Of what use is all the improved machinery unless it tends to give the
farmer a little more leisure?What is harvesting now, compared with what
it was in the old time?Think of the days of reaping, of cradling, of
raking and binding and mowing.Think of threshing with the flail and
winnowing with the wind.And now think of the reapers and mowers, the
binders and threshing machines, the plows and cultivators, upon which
the farmer rides protected from the sun.If, with all these advantages,
you cannot get a living without rising in the middle of the night, go
into some other business.The Hermit is Mad

A hermit is a mad man.Without friends and wife and child, there is
nothing left worth living for.They
are filled with egotism and envy, with vanity and hatred.People who
live much alone become narrow and suspicious.They are apt to be the
property of one idea.They begin to think there is no use in anything.They look upon the happiness of others as a kind of folly.They hate
joyous folks, because, way down in their hearts, they envy them.Duke Orang-Outang

I think we came from the lower animals.I am not dead sure of it, but
think so.When I first read about it I didn't like it.My heart was
filled with sympathy for those people who leave nothing to be proud of
except ancestors.I thought how terrible this will be upon the nobility
of the old world.Think of their being forced to trace their ancestry
back to the Duke Orang-Outang or to the Princess Chimpanzee.After
thinking it all over I came to the conclusion that I liked that
doctrine.I read about
rudimentary bones and muscles.I was told that everybody had rudimentary
muscles extending from the ear into the cheek.I was told: "They are the remains of muscles; they became rudimentary
from the lack of use."They are the muscles
with which your ancestors used to flap their ears.Well, at first I was
greatly astonished, and afterward I was more astonished to find they had
become rudimentary.Self-Made Men

It is often said of this or that man that he is a self-made man--that
he was born of the poorest and humblest parents, and that with every
obstacle to overcome he became great.Most of the intellectual giants of the world
have been nursed at the sad but loving breast of poverty.Most of those
who have climbed highest on the shining ladder of fame commenced at the
lowest round.They were reared in the straw thatched cottages of Europe;
in the log houses of America; in the factories of the great cities; in
the midst of toil; in the smoke and din of labor.The One Window in the Ark

A cubit is twenty-two inches; so that the ark was five hundred and fifty
feet long, ninety-one feet and eight inches wide, and fifty-five feet
high.The ark was divided into three stories, and had on top, one window
twenty-two inches square.Ventillation must have been one of Jehovah's
hobbies.Think of a ship larger than the Great Eastern with only one
window, and that but twenty-two inches square!No Ante-Diluvian Camp-Meetings!It is a little curious that when God wished to reform the ante-diluvian
world he said nothing about hell; that he had no revivals, no
camp-meetings, no tracts, no out-pourings of the Holy Ghost, no
baptisms, no noon prayer meetings, and never mentioned the great
doctrine of salvation by faith.If the orthodox creeds of the world are
true, all those people went to hell without ever having heard that such
a place existed.If eternal torment is a fact, surely these miserable
wretches ought to have been warned.They were threatened only with water
when they were in fact doomed to eternal fire!Hard Work in the Ark

Eight persons did all the work.They attended to the wants of 175,000
birds, 3,616 beasts, 1,300 reptiles, and 2,000,000 insects, saying
nothing of countless animalculae.Can we believe that the inspired writer had any idea of the size of the
sun?Draw a circle five inches in diameter, and by its side thrust a pin
through the paper.The hole made by the pin will sustain about the same
relation to the circle that the earth does to the sun.Did he know that
the sun was eight hundred and sixty thousand miles in diameter; that it
was enveloped in an ocean of fire thousands of miles in depth, hotter
even than the Christian's hell?Did he know that the volume of the Earth
is less than one-millionth of that of the sun?Did he know of the one
hundred and four planets belonging to our solar system, all children of
the sun?Did he know of Jupiter eighty-five thousand miles in diameter,
hundreds of times as large as our earth, turning on his axis at the rate
of twenty-five thousand miles an hour accompanied by four moons making
the tour of his orbit once only in fifty years?Something for Nothing

It is impossible for me to conceive of something being created for
nothing.Nothing, regarded in the light of raw material, is a decided
failure.Neither is it
possible to think of force disconnected with matter.You cannot imagine
matter going back to absolute nothing.Neither can you imagine nothing
being changed into something.You may be eternally damned if you do not
say that you can conceive these things, but you cannot conceive them.Polygamy

Polygamy is just as pure in Utah as it could have been in the promised
land.Love and virtue are the same the whole world around, and justice
is the same in every star.All the languages of the world are not
sufficient to express the filth of polygamy.It makes of man a beast,
of woman a trembling slave.It destroys the fireside, makes virtue an
outcast, takes from human speech its sweetest words, and leaves the
heart a den, where crawl and hiss the slimy serpents of most loathsome
lust.The good family is the unit
of good government.The virtues grow about the holy hearth of home--they
cluster, bloom, and shed their perfume round the fireside where the
one man loves the one woman.Lover--husband--wife--mother--father--child--home!--without these sacred
words the world is but a lair, and men and women merely beasts.The Colonel in the Kitchen--How to Cook a Beefsteak

There ought to be a law making it a crime, punishable by imprisonment,
to fry a beefsteak.Broil it; it is just as easy, and when broiled it
is delicious.Fried beefsteak is not fit for a wild beast.You can broil
even on a stove.Shut the front damper--open the back one, and then take
off a griddle.There will then be a draft down through this opening.Put
on your steak, using a wire broiler, and not a particle of smoke will
touch it, for the reason that the smoke goes down.If you try to broil
it with the front damper open the smoke will rise.For broiling, coal,
even soft coal, makes a better fire than wood.Do not huddle together in a little room
around a red-hot stove, with every window fastened down.Do not live in
this poisoned atmosphere, and then, when one of your children dies, put
a piece in the papers commencing with, "Whereas, it has pleased divine
Providence to remove from our midst--."Have plenty of air, and plenty
of warmth.Do not imagine anything is unhealthy
simply because it is pleasant.Cooking a Fine Art

Cooking is one of the fine arts.Give your wives and daughters things to
cook, and things to cook with, and they will soon become most excellent
cooks.The man whose arteries
and veins are filled with rich blood made of good and well cooked food,
has pluck, courage, endurance and noble impulses.Remember that your
wife should have things to cook with.Scathing Impeachment of Intemperance

Intemperance cuts down youth in its vigor, manhood in its strength, and
age in its weakness.It breaks the father's heart, bereaves the doting
mother, extinguishes natural affections, erases conjugal loves, blots
out filial attachments, blights parental hope, and brings down mourning
age in sorrow to the grave.It produces weakness, not strength;
sickness, not health; death, not life.It makes wives widows; children
orphans; fathers fiends, and all of them paupers and beggars.It feeds
rheumatism, nurses gout, welcomes epidemics, invites cholera, imports
pestilence and embraces consumption.It covers the land with idleness,
misery and crime.It fills your jails, supplies your almshouses and
demands your asylums.It engenders controversies, fosters quarrels, and
cherishes riots.It crowds your penitentiaries and furnishes victims to
your scaffolds.It is the life blood of the gambler, the element of
the burglar, the prop of the highwayman and the support of the midnight
incendiary.It countenances the liar, respects the thief, esteems
the blasphemer.It violates obligations, reverences fraud, and honors
infamy.It defames benevolence, hates love, scorns virtue and slanders
innocence.It incites the father to butcher his helpless offspring,
helps the husband to massacre his wife, and the child to grind the
parricidal ax.It burns up men, consumes women, detests life, curses God,
and despises heaven.It suborns witnesses, nurses perjury, defiles
the jury box, and stains the judicial ermine.It degrades the citizen,
debases the legislator, dishonors statesmen, and disarms the patriot.It
brings shame, not honor; terror, not safety; despair, not hope; misery,
not happiness; and with the malevolence of a fiend, it calmly surveys
its frightful desolation, and unsatisfied with its havoc, it poisons
felicity, kills peace, ruins morals, blights confidence, slays
reputation, and wipes out national honors, then curses the world and
laughs at its ruin.Liberty Defined

The French convention gave the best definition of liberty I have ever
read: "The liberty of one citizen ceases only where the liberty of
another citizen commences."I ask you
to-day to make a declaration of individual independence.And if you are
independent, be just.Allow everybody else to make his declaration of
individual independence.Allow your wife, allow your husband, allow
your children to make theirs.It is a grand thing to be the owner of
yourself.It is a grand thing to protect the rights of others.It is a
sublime thing to be free and just.Free, Honest Thought

I am going to say what little I can to make the American people brave
enough and generous enough and kind enough to give everybody else the
rights they have themselves.Can there ever be any progress in this
world to amount to anything until we have liberty?The thoughts of a man
who is not free are not worth much--not much.A man who thinks with the
club of a creed above his head--a man who thinks casting his eye askance
at the flames of hell, is not apt to have very good thoughts.And for
my part, I would not care to have any status or social position even in
heaven if I had to admit that I never would have been there only I got
scared.When we are frightened we do not think very well.If you want to
get at the honest thoughts of a man he must free.If he is not free you
will not get his honest thought.Ingersoll Prefers Shoemakers to Princes

The other day there came shoemakers, potters, workers in wood and iron,
from Europe, and they were received in the city of New York as though
they had been princes.They had been sent by the great republic of
France to examine into the arts and manufactures of the great republic
of America.They looked a thousand times better to me than the Edward
Alberts and Albert Edwards--the royal vermin, that live on the body
politic.And I would think much more of our government if it would fete
and feast them, instead of wining and dining the imbeciles of a royal
line.I never saw a dignified man that was not after all an
old idiot Dignity is a mask; a dignified man is afraid that you will
know he does not know everything.A man of sense and argument is always
willing to admit what he don't know--why?--because there is so much
that he does know; and that is the first step towards learning
anything--willingness to admit what you don't know, and when you don't
understand a thing, ask--no matter how small and silly it may look to
other people--ask, and after that you know.A man never is in a state of
mind that he can learn until he gets that dignified nonsense out of him.The time is coming when a man will be rated at his real worth, and that
by his brain and heart.We care nothing now about an officer unless he
fills his place.The time will come when no matter how much money a man
has he will not be respected unless he is using it for the benefit of
his fellow-men.Three millions have increased to fifty--thirteen
States to thirty-eight.We have better homes, and more of the
conveniences of life than any other people upon the face of the globe.The farmers of our country live better than did the kings and princes
two hundred years ago--and they have twice as much sense and heart.Remember that the man who acts best his part--who loves
his friends the best--is most willing to help others--truest to the
obligation--who has the best heart--the most feeling--the deepest
sympathies--and who freely gives to others the rights that he claims for
himself, is the true nobleman.We have disfranchised the aristocrats of
the air and have given one country to mankind.Wanted!--More Manliness

I had a thousand times rather have a farm and be independent, than to be
President of the United States, without independence, filled with
doubt and trembling, feeling of the popular pulse, resorting to art and
artifice, inquiring about the wind of opinion, and succeeding at last in
losing my self-respect without gaining the respect of others.Man needs
more manliness, more real independence.This we can do by labor, and in this way we can preserve our
independence.We should try and choose that business or profession the
pursuit of which will give us the most happiness.We can be happy without being rich--without holding office--without
being famous.I am not sure that we can be happy with wealth, with
office, or with fame.Education of Nature

It has been a favorite idea with me that our forefathers were educated
by nature; that they grew grand as the continent upon which they landed;
that the great rivers--the wide plains--the splendid lakes--the lonely
forests--the sublime mountains--that all these things stole into and
became a part of their being, and they grew great as the country in
which they lived.They began to hate the narrow, contracted views of
Europe.The Worker Wearing the Purple

I want to see a workingman have a good house, painted white, grass in
the front yard, carpets on the floor and pictures on the wall.I want to
see him a man feeling that he is a king by the divine right of living in
the Republic.And every man here is just a little bit a king, you know.Every man here is a part of the sovereign power.Every man wears a
little of purple; every man has a little of crown and a little of
sceptre; and every man that will sell his vote for money or be ruled by
prejudice is unfit to be an American citizen.Flowers

Beautify your grounds with plants and flowers and vines.Remember that everything of beauty tends to the elevation of
man.Every little morning-glory whose purple bosom is thrilled with the
amorous kisses of the sun tends to put a blossom in your heart.Do not
judge of the value of everything by the market reports.Every flower
about a house certifies to the refinement of somebody.Every vine,
climbing and blossoming, tells of love and joy.The grave is not a throne, and a corpse is not a king.The living have
a right to control this world.I think a good deal more of to day than
I do of yesterday, and I think more of to-morrow than I do of this day;
because it is nearly gone--that is the way I feel.The time to be happy
is now; the way to be happy is to make somebody else happy and the place
to be happy is here.The School House a Fort

Education is the most radical thing in the world.To teach the alphabet is to inaugurate a revolution.To build a school
house is to construct a fort.We are Getting Free

We are getting free.We are
investigating with the microscope and the telescope.We are digging
into the earth and finding souvenirs of all the ages.We are finding out
something about the laws of health and disease.We are adding years to
the span of human life and we are making the world fit to live in.That is what we are doing, and every man that has an honest thought and
expresses it helps, and every man that tries to keep honest thought from
being expressed is an obstruction and a hindrance.The Solid Rock

I have made up my mind that if there is a God He will be merciful to the
merciful.That He will forgive the forgiving;
upon that rock I stand.That every man should be true to himself, and
that there is no world, no star, in which honesty is a crime; and upon
that rock I stand.An honest man, a good, kind, sweet woman, or a happy
child, has nothing to fear, neither in this world nor the world to come;
and upon that rock I stand.INGERSOLL'S FIVE GOSPELS




408.The Gospel of Cheerfulness

I believe in the gospel of cheerfulness; the gospel of good nature; in
the gospel of good health.Let us pay some attention to our bodies; take
care of our bodies, and our souls will take care of themselves.I believe the time will come when the public thought will be so
great and grand that it will be looked upon as infamous to perpetuate
disease.I believe the time will come when men will not fill the future
with consumption and with insanity.I believe the time will come when
with studying ourselves and understanding the laws of health, we will
say we are under obligations to put the flags of health in the cheeks of
our children.Even if I got to Heaven, and had a harp, I would hate to
look back upon my children and see them diseased, deformed, crazed, all
suffering the penalty of crimes that I had committed.The Gospel of Liberty

And I believe, too, in the gospel of liberty,---of giving to others what
we claim.And I believe there is room everywhere for thought, and
the more liberty you give away the more you will have.In liberty
extravagance is economy.Let us be just, let us be generous to each
other.The Gospel of 'Good Living

I believe in the gospel of good living.You cannot make any God happy by
fasting.Let us have good food, and let us have it well cooked; it is
a thousand times better to know how to cook it than it is to understand
any theology in the world.I
believe in the gospel of good houses; in the gospel of water and soap.The Gospel of Intelligence

I believe in the gospel of intelligence.That is the only lever capable
of raising mankind.I believe in the gospel of intelligence; in the
gospel of education.The school-house is my cathedral; the universe
is my Bible.And no God can put a man into hell in another world who has
made a little heaven in this.God cannot make miserable a man who has
made somebody else happy.God can not hate anybody who is capable of
loving his neighbor.So I believe in this great gospel of generosity.Ah, but they say it won't do.My gospel
of health will prolong life; my gospel of intelligence, my gospel of
loving, my gospel of good-fellowship will cover the world with happy
homes.My doctrine will put carpets upon your floors, pictures upon your
walls.My doctrine will put books upon your shelves, ideas in your mind.My doctrine will relieve the world of the abnormal monsters born of the
ignorance of superstition.My doctrine will give us health, wealth, and
happiness.The Gospel of Justice

I believe in the gospel of justice,--that we must reap what we sow.Smith, and God forgive me,
how does that help Smith?If I by slander cover some poor girl with
the leprosy of some imputed crime, and she withers away like a blighted
flower, and afterwards I get forgiveness, how does that help her?If
there is another world, we have got to settle; no bankruptcy court
there.Among the ancient Jews if you committed a crime you
had to kill a sheep; now they say, "Charge it.For every crime you commit you must answer to yourself and
to the one you injure.And if you have ever clothed another with
unhappiness as with a garment cf pain, you will never be quite as
happy as though you hadn't done that thing.No forgiveness, eternal,
inexorable, everlasting justice--that is what I believe in.And if it goes hard with me, I will stand it.And I will stick to my
logic, and I will bear it like a man.GEMS FROM THE CONTROVERSIAL GASKET

     Latest Utterances of Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll,
     in a Controversy with Judge Jere 8.Black,
     on "The Christian Religion"




413.The Origin of the Controversy

Several months ago, _The North American Review_ asked me to write an
article, saying that it would be published if some one would furnish a
reply.I wrote the article that appeared in the August number, and by
me it was entitled "Is All of the Bible Inspired?"Not until the
article was written did I know who was expected to answer.I make this
explanation for the purpose of dissipating the impression that Mr.To have struck his shield with my lance might
have given birth to the impression that I was somewhat doubtful as to
the correctness of my position.I naturally expected an answer from some
professional theologian, and was surprised to find that a reply had been
written by a "policeman," who imagined that he had answered my arguments
by simply telling me that my statements were false.It is somewhat
unfortunate that in a discussion like this any one should resort to the
slightest personal detraction.The theme is great enough to engage the
highest faculties of the human mind, and in the investigation of such a
subject vituperation is singularly and vulgarly out of place.Arguments
cannot be answered with insults.It is unfortunate that the intellectual
arena should be entered by a "policeman," who has more confidence in
concussion than discussion.Good nature is often
mistaken for virtue, and good health sometimes passes for genius.Anger blows out the lamp of the mind.In the examination of a great and
important question, every one should be serene, slow-pulsed, and calm.Black's reply, feeling that so
grand a subject should not be blown and tainted with malicious words, I
proceed to answer as best I may the arguments he has urged.Of course it is still claimed that we are a Christian people, indebted
to something we call Christianity, for all the progress we have made.There is still a vast difference of opinion as to what Christianity
really is, although many wavering sects have been discussing that
question, with fire and sword through centuries of creed and crime.Every new sect has been denounced at its birth as illegitimate, as
something born out of orthodox wedlock, and that should have been
allowed to perish on the steps where it was found.Summary of Evangelical Belief

Among the evangelical churches there is a substantial agreement
upon what they consider the fundamental truths of the gospel.These
fundamental truths, as I understand them, are:--That there is a personal
God, the creator of the material universe; that he made man of the dust,
and woman from part of the man; that the man and woman were tempted by
the devil; that they were turned out of the garden of Eden; that, about
fifteen hundred years afterward, God's patience having been exhausted by
the wickedness of mankind, He drowned His children, with the exception
of eight persons; that afterward He selected from their descendants
Abraham, and through him the Jewish people; that He gave laws to these
people, and tried to govern them in all things; that He made known His
will in many ways; that He wrought a vast number of miracles; that
He inspired men to write the Bible; that, in the fullness of time, it
having been found impossible to reform mankind, this God came upon earth
as a child born of the Virgin Mary; that He lived in Palestine; that He
preached for about three years, going from place to place, occasionally
raising the dead, curing the blind and the halt; that He was
crucified--for the crime of blasphemy, as the Jews supposed, but, that
as a matter of fact, He was offered as a sacrifice for the sins of
all who might have faith in Him; that He was raised from the dead and
ascended into heaven, where He now is, making intercession for His
followers; that He will forgive the sins of all who believe on Him,
and that those who do not believe will be consigned to the dungeons of
eternal pain.These--(it may be with the addition of the sacraments of
Baptism and the Last Supper)--constitute what is generally known as the
Christian religion.A Profound Change in the World of Thought

A profound change has taken place in the world of thought.The pews are
trying to set themselves somewhat above the pulpit.The layman discusses
theology with the minister, and smiles.Christians excuse themselves
for belonging to the church by denying a part of the creed.The idea
is abroad that they who know the most of nature believe the least about
theology.The sciences are regarded as infidels, and facts as scoffers.Thousands of most excellent people avoid churches, and, with few
exceptions, only those attend prayer meetings who wish to be alone.The
pulpit is losing because the people are rising.The Believer in the Inspiration of the Bible has too Much to Believe

But the believer in the inspiration of the Bible is compelled to declare
that there was a time when slavery was right--when men could buy and
women sell their babes.He is compelled to insist that there was a time
when polygamy was the highest form of virtue; when wars of extermination
were waged with the sword of mercy; when religious toleration was a
crime, and when death was the just penalty for having expressed an
honest thought.He must maintain that Jehovah is just as bad now as he
was four thousand years ago, or that he was just as good then as he is
now, but that human conditions have so changed that slavery, polygamy,
religious persecutions and wars of conquest are now perfectly devilish.Once they were right--once they were commanded by God himself; now, they
are prohibited.There has been such a change in the conditions of man
that, at the present time, the devil is in favor of slavery, polygamy,
religious persecution and wars of conquest.That is to say, the devil
entertains the same opinion to-day that Jehovah held four thousand
years ago, but in the meantime Jehovah has remained exactly the
same--changeless and incapable of change.A Frank Admission

It is most cheerfully admitted that a vast number of people not only
believe these things, but hold them in exceeding reverence, and imagine
them to be of the utmost importance to mankind.They regard the Bible as
the only light that God has given for the guidance of His children; that
it is the one star in nature's sky--the foundation of all morality, of
all law, of all order, and of all individual and national progress.They
regard it as the only means we have for ascertaining the will of God,
the origin of man, and the destiny of the soul.The mistake has hindered in countless ways the civilization of
man.The Bible Should be Better than any other Book

In all ages of which any record has been preserved, there have been
those who gave their ideas of justice, charity, liberty, love, and
law.Now, if the Bible is really the work of God, it should contain the
grandest and sublimest truths.It should, in all respects, excel the
works of man.Within that book should be found the best and loftiest
definitions of justice; the truest conceptions of human liberty; the
clearest outlines of duty; the tenderest, the highest, and the noblest
thoughts,--not that the human mind has produced, but that the human mind
is capable of receiving.Upon every page should be found the luminous
evidence of its divine origin.Unless it contains grander and more
wonderful things than man has written, we are not only justified in
saying, but we are compelled to say, that it was written by no being
superior to man.A Serious Charge

The Bible has been the fortress and the defense of nearly every crime.No civilized country could re-enact its laws.And in many respects its
moral code is abhorrent to every good and tender man.It is admitted,
however, that many of its precepts are pure, that many of its laws are
wise and just, and that many of its statements are absolutely true.If the Bible is Not Verbally Inspired, What Then?It may be said that it is unfair to call attention to certain bad things
in the Bible, while the good are not so much as mentioned.To this it
may be replied that a divine being would not put bad things in a book.Certainly a being of infinite intelligence, power, and goodness could
never fall below the ideal of "depraved and barbarous" man.It will not
do, after we find that the Bible upholds what we now call crimes, to say
that it is not verbally inspired.If the words are not inspired, what
is?It may be said that the thoughts are inspired.But this would
include only the thoughts expressed without words.If the ideas are
inspired, they must be contained in and expressed only by inspired
words; that is to say, the arrangement of the words, with relation to
each other, must have been inspired.A Hindu Example

Suppose that we should now discover a Hindu book of equal antiquity with
the Old Testament, containing a defense of slavery, polygamy, wars of
extermination, and religious persecution, would we regard it as evidence
that the writers were inspired by an infinitely wise and merciful God?A Test Fairly Applied

Suppose we knew that after "inspired" men had finished the Bible, the
devil had got possession of it and wrote a few passages, what part of
the sacred Scriptures would Christians now pick out as being probably
his work?Which of the following passages would naturally be selected
as having been written by the devil--"Love thy neighbor as thyself," or
"Kill all the males among the little ones, and kill every woman; but all
the women children keep alive for yourselves?"It will hardly be claimed at this day, that the passages in the
Bible upholding slavery, polygamy, war, and religious persecution are
evidences of the inspiration of that book.Suppose that there had been
nothing in the Old Testament upholding these crimes would any modern
Christian suspect that it was not inspired on account of that omission?Suppose that there had been nothing in the Old Testament but laws in
favor of these crimes, would any intelligent Christian now contend that
it was the work of the true God?Proofs of Civilization

We know that there was a time in the history of almost every nation when
slavery, polygamy, and wars of extermination were regarded as divine
institutions; when women were looked upon as beasts of burden, and when,
among some people, it was considered the duty of the husband to murder
the wife for differing with him on the subject of religion.Nations that
entertain these views to-day are regarded as savage, and, probably, with
the exception of the South Sea islanders, the Feejees, some citizens
of Delaware, and a few tribes in Central Africa, no human beings can be
found degraded enough to agree upon these subjects with the Jehovah of
the ancient Jews.The only evidence we have, or can have, that a
nation has ceased to be savage is the fact that it has abandoned these
doctrines.To every one, except the theologian, it is perfectly easy to
account for the mistakes, atrocities, and crimes of the past, by
saying that civilization is a slow and painful growth; that the moral
perceptions are cultivated through ages of tyranny, of want, of crime,
and of heroism; that it requires centuries for man to put out the eyes
of self and hold in lofty and in equal poise the scales of justice;
that conscience is born of suffering; that mercy is the child of the
imagination--of the power to put oneself in the sufferers place, and
that man advances only as he becomes acquainted with his surroundings,
with the mutual obligations of life, and learns to take advantage of the
forces of nature.A Persian Gospel

Do not misunderstand me.My position is that the cruel passages in
the Old Testament are not inspired; that slavery, polygamy, wars of
extermination, and religious persecution always have been, are, and
forever will be, abhorred and cursed by the honest, virtuous, and the
loving; that the innocent cannot justly suffer for the guilty, and that
vicarious vice and vicarious virtue are equally absurd; that eternal
punishment is eternal revenge; that only the natural can happen; that
miracles prove the dishonesty of the few and the credulity of the many;
and that, according to Matthew, Mark, and Luke, salvation does not
depend upon belief, nor the atonement, nor a "second birth," but that
these gospels are in exact harmony with the declaration of the great
Persian: "Taking the first footstep with the good thought, the second
with the good word, and the third with the good deed, I entered
paradise."The dogmas of the past no longer reach the level of the
highest thought, nor satisfy the hunger of the heart.While dusty
faiths, embalmed and sepulchered in ancient texts, remain the same,
the sympathies of men enlarge; the brain no longer kills its young; the
happy lips give liberty to honest thoughts; the mental firmament expands
and lifts; the broken clouds drift by; the hideous dreams, the foul,
misshapen children of the monstrous night, dissolve and fade.Man the Author of all Books

So far as we know, man is the author of all books.If a book had been
found on the earth by the first man, he might have regarded it as the
work of God; but as men were here a good while before any books were
found, and as man has produced a great many books, the probability is
that the Bible is no exception.God and Brahma

Can we believe that God ever said of any: "Let his children be
fatherless and his wife a widow; let his children be continually
vagabonds, and beg; let them seek their bread also out of their desolate
places; let the extortioner catch all that he hath and let the stranger
spoil his labor, let there be none to extend mercy unto him, neither let
there be any to favor his fatherless children."If he ever said these
words, surely he had never heard this line, this strain of music, from
the Hindu: "Sweet is the lute to those who have not heard the prattle of
their own children."Jehovah, "from the clouds and darkness of Sinai,"
said to the Jews: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me.... Thou
shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them; for I, the Lord thy
God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the
children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me."Contrast this with the words put by the Hindu in the mouth of Brahma:
"I am the same to all mankind.They who honestly serve other gods,
involuntarily worship me.I am he who partaketh of all worship, and I
am the reward of all worshipers."The first, a
dungeon where crawl the things begot of jealous slime; the other, great
as the domed firmament inlaid with suns.Matthew, Mark, and Luke

And I here take occasion to say, that with most of the teachings of the
gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke I most heartily agree.The miraculous
parts must, of course, be thrown aside.I admit that the necessity of
belief, the atonement, and the scheme of salvation are all set forth
in the Gospel of John,--a gospel, in my opinion, not written until long
after the others.Christianity Takes no Step in Advance

All the languages of the world have not words of horror enough to
paint the agonies of man when the church had power.Tiberius, Caligula,
Claudius, Nero, Domitian, and Commodus were not as cruel, false,
and base as many of the Christian Popes.Opposite the names of these
imperial criminals write John the XII., Leo the VIII., Boniface the VII.,
Benedict the IX., Innocent the III., and Alexander the VI.Was it under
these pontiffs that the "church penetrated the moral darkness like a
new sun," and covered the globe with institutions of mercy?Rome was far
better when Pagan than when Catholic.It was better to allow gladiators
and criminals to fight than to burn honest men.The greatest of Romans
denounced the cruelties of the arena.Seneca condemned the combats even
of wild beasts.He was tender enough to say that "we should have a bond
of sympathy for all sentiment beings, knowing that only the depraved
and base take pleasure in the sight of blood and suffering."Aurelius
compelled the gladiators to fight with blunted swords.Roman lawyers
declared that all men are by nature free and equal.Woman, under Pagan
rule in Rome, become as free as man.Zeno, long before the birth of
Christ, taught that virtue alone establishes a difference between men.We know that the Civil Law is the foundation of our codes.We know that
fragments of Greek and Roman art--a few manuscripts saved from Christian
destruction, some inventions and discoveries of the Moors--were the
seeds of modern civilization.Christianity, for a thousand years,
taught memory to forget and reason to believe.Not one step was taken in
advance.Over the manuscripts of philosophers and poets, priests, with
their ignorant tongues thrust out, devoutly scrawled the forgeries of
faith.Christianity a Mixture of Good and Evil

Mr.Black attributes to me the following expression: "Christianity is
pernicious in its moral effect, darkens the mind, narrows the soul,
arrests the progress of human society, and hinders civilization."Strange, that he is only able to answer what I did
not say.I endeavored to show that the passages in the Old Testament
upholding slavery, polygamy, wars of extermination, and religious
intolerance had filled the world with blood and crime.I admitted
that there are many wise and good things in the Old Testament.I also
insisted that the doctrine of the atonement--that is to say, of moral
bankruptcy--the idea that a certain belief is necessary to salvation,
and the frightful dogma of eternal pain, had narrowed the soul, had
darkened the mind, and had arrested the progress of human society.Like
other religions, Christianity is a mixture of good and evil.The church
has made more orphans than it has fed.It has never built asylums enough
to hold the insane of its own making.Jehovah, Epictetus and Cicero

If the Bible is really inspired, Jehovah commanded the Jewish people to
buy the children of the strangers that sojourned among them, and ordered
that the children thus bought should be an inheritance for the children
of the Jews, and that they should be bondmen and bondwomen forever.Yet
Epictetus, a man to whom no revelation was ever made, a man whose soul
followed only the light of nature, and who had never heard of the Jewish
God, was great enough to say: "Will you not remember that your servants
are by nature your brothers, the children of God?In saying that you
have bought them, you look down on the earth and into the pit, on the
wretched law of men long since dead,--but you see not the laws of the
Gods."We find that Jehovah, speaking to his chosen people, assured them
that their bondmen and bondmaids must be "of the heathen that were
round about them.""Of them," said Jehovah, "shall ye buy bondmen
and bondmaids."And yet Cicero, a pagan, Cicero, who had never been
enlightened by reading the Old Testament, had the moral grandeur to
declare: "They who say that we should love our fellow-citizens, but not
foreigners, destroy the universal brotherhood of mankind, with which
benevolence and justice would perish forever."The Atonement

In countless ways the Christian world has endeavored, for nearly two
thousand years, to explain the atonement, and every effort has ended in
an an mission that it cannot be understood, and a declaration that it
must be believed.Is it not immoral to teach that man can sin, that he
can harden his heart and pollute his soul, and that, by repenting
and believing something that he does not comprehend, he can avoid the
consequences of his crimes?Has the promise and hope of forgiveness ever
prevented the commission of a sin?Should men be taught that sin gives
happiness here; that they ought to bear the evils of a virtuous life in
this world for the sake of joy in the next; that they can repent between
the last sin and the last breath; that after repentance every stain
of the soul is washed away by the innocent blood of another; that the
serpent of regret will not hiss in the ear of memory; that the saved
will not even pity the victims of their own crimes; that the goodness
of another can be transferred to them; and that sins forgiven cease to
affect the unhappy wretches sinned against?Sin as a Debt

The Church says that the sinner is in debt to God, and that the
obligation is discharged by the Saviour.The best that can possibly be
said of such a transaction is, that the debt is transferred, not paid.The truth is, that a sinner is in debt to the person he has injured.If a man injures his neighbor, it is not enough for him to get the
forgiveness of God, but he must have the forgiveness of his neighbor.If a man puts his hand in the fire and God forgives him, his hand will
smart exactly the same.You must, after all, reap what you sow.No god
can give you wheat when you sow tares, and no devil can give you tares
when you sow wheat.The Logic of the Coffin

As to the doctrine of the atonement, Mr.Black has nothing to offer
except the barren statement that it is believed by the wisest and the
best.A Mohammedan, speaking in Constantinople, will say the same of the
Koran.A Brahman, in a Hindu temple, will make the same remark, and so
will the American Indian, when he endeavors to enforce something upon
the young of his tribe.He will say: "The best, the greatest of our
tribe have believed in this."This is the argument of the cemetery, the
philosophy of epitaphs, the logic of the coffin.We are the greatest and
wisest and most virtuous of mankind?This statement, that it has been
believed by the best, is made in connection with an admission that it
cannot be fathomed by the wisest.It is not claimed that a thing is
necessarily false because it is not understood, but I do claim that
it is not necessarily true because it cannot be comprehended.I still
insist that "the plan of redemption," as usually preached, is absurd,
unjust, and immoral.Judas Iscariot

For nearly two thousand years Judas Iscariot has been execrated by
mankind; and yet, if the doctrine of the atonement is true, upon his
treachery hung the plan of salvation.Suppose Judas had known of this
plan--known that he was selected by Christ for that very purpose, that
Christ was depending on him.And suppose that he also knew that only
by betraying Christ could he save either himself or others; what ought
Judas to have done?Are you willing to rely upon an argument that
justifies the treachery of that wretch?The Standard of Right

According to Mr.Black, the man who does not believe in a supreme being
acknowledges no standard of right and wrong in this world, and therefore
can have no theory of rewards and punishments in the next.Is it
possible that only those who believe in the God who persecuted for
opinion's sake have any standard of right and wrong?Were the greatest
men of all antiquity without this standard?In the eyes of intelligent
men of Greece and Rome, were all deeds, whether good or evil, morally
alike?Is it necessary to believe in the existence of an infinite
intelligence before you can have any standard of right and wrong?Is it
possible that a being cannot be just or virtuous unless he believes in
some being infinitely superior to himself?If this doctrine be true, how
can God be just or virtuous?Does He believe in some being superior to
himself?If man were incapable of suffering, if man could not
feel pain, the word "conscience" never would have passed his lips.The
man who puts himself in the place of another, whose imagination has been
cultivated to the point of feeling the agonies suffered by another, is
the man of conscience.Black says, "We have neither jurisdiction or capacity to rejudge
the justice of God."In other words, we have no right to think upon
this subject, no right to examine the questions most vitally affecting
human-kind.We are simply to accept the ignorant statements of barbarian
dead.This question cannot be settled by saying that "it would be a
mere waste of time and space to enumerate the proofs which show that the
universe was created by a pre-existent and self-conscious being."The
time and space should have been "wasted," and the proofs should have
been enumerated.These "proofs" are what the wisest and greatest are
trying to find.It cares nothing
for the opinions of the "great," nothing for the prejudices of the many,
and least of all, for the superstitions of the dead.In the world of
science--a fact is a legal tender.Assertions and miracles are base and
spurious coins.We have the right to rejudge the justice even of a god.No one should throw away his reason--the fruit of all experience.It is
the intellectual capital of the soul, the only light, the only guide,
and without it the brain becomes the palace of an idiot king, attended
by a retinue of thieves and hypocrites.The Liberty of the Bible

This is the religious liberty of the Bible.If you had lived in
Palestine, and if the wife of your bosom, dearer to you than your
own soul, had said: "I like the religion of India better than that of
Palestine," it would have been your duty to kill her."Your eye must not
pity her, your hand must be first upon her, and afterwards the hand of
all the people."If she had said: "Let us worship the sun--the sun that
clothes the earth in garments of green--the sun, the great fireside of
the world--the sun that covers the hills and valleys with flowers--that
gave me your face, and made it possible for me to look into the eyes
of my babe,--let us worship the sun," it was your duty to kill her.You
must throw the first stone, and when against her bosom--a bosom filled
with love for you--you had thrown the jagged and cruel rock, and had
seen the red stream of her life oozing from the dumb lips of death,
you could then look up and receive the congratulations of the God whose
commandment you had obeyed.Is it possible that a being of infinite
mercy ordered a husband to kill his wife for the crime of having
expressed, an opinion on the subject of religion?Has there been found
upon the records of the savage world anything more perfectly fiendish
than this commandment of Jehovah?This is justified on the ground that
"blasphemy was a breach of political allegiance, and idolatry an act of
overt treason."We can understand how a human king stands in need of the
service of his people.We can understand how the desertion of any of
his soldiers weakens his army; but were the king infinite in power,
his strength would still remain the same, and under no conceivable
circumstances could the enemy triumph.Slavery in Heaven

According to Mr.Black, there will be slavery in Heaven, and fast by
the throne of God will be the auction-block, and the streets of the New
Jerusalem will be adorned with the whipping-post, while the music of
the harp will be supplemented by the crack of the driver's whip.Black, "incorporate him into his family,
tame him, teach him to think, and give him a knowledge of the true
principles of human liberty and government, he would confer upon him a
most beneficent boon."Black is too late with his protest against
the freedom of his fellow-men.Liberty is making the tour of the world.Russia has emancipated her serfs; the slave trade is prosecuted only
by thieves and pirates; Spain feels upon her cheek the burning blush
of shame; Brazil, with proud and happy eyes, is looking for the dawn of
freedom's day; the people of the South rejoice that slavery is no more,
and every good and honest man (excepting Mr.Black) of every land and
clime hopes that the limbs of men will never feel again the weary weight
of chains.Jehovah Breaking His Own Laws

A very curious thing about these Commandments is that their supposed
author violated nearly every one.From Sinai, according to the account,
He said: "Thou shalt not kill," and yet He ordered the murder of
millions; "Thou shalt not commit adultery," and He gave captured maidens
to gratify the lust of captors; "Thou shalt not steal," and yet He gave
to Jewish marauders the flocks and herds of others; "Thou shalt not
covet thy neighbor's house, nor his wife," and yet He allowed His chosen
people to destroy the homes of neighbors and to steal their wives;
"Honor thy father and mother," and yet this same God had thousands of
fathers butchered, and with the sword of war killed children yet unborn;
"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor," and yet
He sent abroad "lying spirits" to deceive His own prophets, and in a
hundred ways paid tribute to deceit.So far as we know, Jehovah kept
only one of these Commandments--He worshiped no other god.I know as little as anyone else about the "pla" of the universe; and as
to the "design," I know just as little.It will not do to say that the
universe was designed, and therefore there must be a designer.There
must first be proof that it was "designed."It will not do to say that
the universe has a "plan," and then assert that there must have been an
infinite maker.The idea that a design must have a beginning, and that a
designer need not, is a simple expression of human ignorance.We find
a watch, and we say: "So curious and wonderful a thing must have had a
maker."We find the watchmaker, and we say: "So curious and wonderful a
thing as man must have had a maker."We find God and we then say: "He is
so wonderful that he must _not_ have had a maker."In other words, all
things a little wonderful must have been created, but it is possible for
something to be so wonderful that it always existed.One would suppose
that just as the wonder increased the necessity for a creator increased,
because it is the wonder of the thing that suggests the idea of
creation.Is it possible that a designer exists from all eternity
without design?Was there no design in having an infinite designer?For
me, it is hard to see the plan or design in earthquakes and pestilences.It is somewhat difficult to discern the design or the benevolence in so
making the world that billions of animals live only on the agonies of
others.The justice of God is not visible to me in the history of this
world.When I think of the suffering and death, of the poverty and
crime, of the cruelty and malice, of the heartlessness of this "design"
and "plan," where beak and claw and tooth tear and rend the quivering
flesh of weakness and despair, I cannot convince myself that it is the
result of infinite wisdom, benevolence, and justice.What we Know of the Infinite

Of course, upon a question like this, nothing can be absolutely known.We live on an atom called Earth, and what we know of the infinite is
almost infinitely limited; but, little as we know, all have an equal
right to give their honest thought.Life is a shadowy, strange,
and winding road on which we travel for a little way--a few short
steps--just from the cradle, with its lullaby of love, to the low and
quiet wayside inn, where all at last must sleep, and where the only
salutation is--Good-night.The Universe Self-Existent

The universe, according to my idea, is, always was, and forever will
be.It did not "come into being;" it is the one eternal being--the only
thing that ever did, does, or can exist.We know nothing of what we call the laws of Nature except as we gather
the idea of law from the uniformity of phenomena springing from like
conditions.To make myself clear: Water always runs down hill.The
theist says that this happens because there is behind the phenomenon an
active law.As a matter of fact law is this side of the phenomenon.Law
does not cause the phenomenon, but the phenomenon causes the idea of law
in our minds, and this idea is produced from the fact that under like
circumstances the same phenomena always happens.Black probably
thinks that the difference in the weight of rocks and clouds was created
by law; that parallel lines fail to imite only because it is illegal;
that diameter and circumference could have been so made that it would
be a greater distance across than around a circle, that a straight line
could inclose a triangle if not prevented by law, and that a little
legislation could make it possible for two bodies to occupy the same
space at the same time.It seems to me that law can not be the cause of
phenomena, but it is an effect produced in our minds by their succession
and resemblance.To put a God back of the universe compels us to admit
that there was a time when nothing existed except this God; that this
God had lived from eternity in an infinite vacuum and in an absolute
idleness.The mind of every thoughtful man is forced to one of these two
conclusions, either that the universe is self-existent or that it
was created by a self-existent being.To my mied there are far more
difficulties in the second hypothesis than in the first.Jehovah's Promise Broken

If Jehovah was in fact God, He knew the end from the beginning.He knew
that his Bible would be a breastwork behind which tyranny and hypocrisy
would crouch; that it would be quoted by tyrants; that it would be the
defense of robbers called kings and of hypocrites called priests.He
knew that He had taught the Jewish people but little of importance.He
knew that He found them free and left them captives.He knew that He
had never fulfilled the promises made to them.He knew that while other
nations had advanced in art and science his chosen people were savage
still.He promised them the world, and gave them a desert.He promised
them liberty, and He made them slaves.He promised them victory, and He
gave them defeat.He said they should be kings, and He made them
serfs.He promised them universal empire, and gave them exile.When one
finishes the Old Testament, he is compelled to say: Nothing can add to
the misery of a nation whose King is Jehovah!Character Bather than Creed

For a thousand years the torch of progress was extinguished in the blood
of Christ, and His disciples, moved by ignorant zeal, by insane, cruel
creeds, destroyed with flame and sword a hundred millions of their
fellow-men.But if cathedrals had been
universities--if dungeons of the Inquisition had been laboratories--if
Christians had believed in character instead of creed--if they had taken
from the Bible all the good and thrown away the wicked and absurd--if
domes of temples had been observatories--if priests had been
philosophers--if missionaries had taught the useful arts--if astrology
had been astronomy--if the black art had been chemistry--if superstition
had been science--if religion had been humanity--it would have been a
heaven filled with love, with liberty, and joy.Mohammed the Prophet of God

Mohammed was a poor man, a driver of camels.He was without education,
without influence, and without wealth, and yet in a few years he
consolidated thousands of tribes, and millions of men confess that there
is "one God, and Mohammed is his prophet."His success was a thousand
times greater during his life than that of Christ.He was not crucified;
he was a conqueror."Of all men, he exercised the greatest influence
upon the human race."Never in the world's history did a religion
spread with the rapidity of his.It burst like a storm over the fairest
portions of the globe.Black is right in his position that
rapidity is secured only by the direct aid of the Divine Being,
then Mohammed was most certainly the prophet of God.As to wars of
extermination and slavery, Mohammed agreed with Mr.Black, and upon
polygamy with Jehovah.As to religious toleration, he was great enough
to say that "men holding to any form of faith might be saved, provided
they were virtuous."In this he was far in advance both of Jehovah and
Mr.Wanted!--A Little More Legislation

We are informed by Mr.Black that "polygamy is neither commanded or
prohibited in the Old Testament--that it is only discouraged."It seems
to me that a little legislation on that subject might have tended to its
"discouragement."Black assures us "consists of certain immutable rules to govern the
conduct of all men at all times and at all places in their private and
personal relations with others," not one word is found on the subject of
polygamy.There is nothing "discouraging" in the Ten Commandments, nor
in the records of any conversation Jehovah is claimed to have had with
Moses upon Sinai.The life of Abraham, the story of Jacob and Laban,
the duty of a brother to be the husband of the widow of his deceased
brother, the life of David, taken in connection with the practice of
one who is claimed to have been the wisest of men--all these things are
probably relied on to show that polygamy was at least "discouraged."Certainly Jehovah had time to instruct Moses as to the infamy of
polygamy.He could have spared a few moments from a description of
patterns of tongs and basins for a subject so important as this.A
few-words in favor of the one wife and one husband--in favor of the
virtuous and loving home--might have taken the place of instructions
as to cutting the garments of priests and fashioning candlesticks and
ounces of gold.If he had left out simply the order that rams' skins
should be dyed red, and in its place had said, "A man shall have but one
wife, and the wife but one husband," how much better it would have been.Again, it is urged that "the acceptance of Christianity by a large
portion of the generation contemporary with its Founder and His
Apostles, was under the circumstances, an adjudication as solemn and
authoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."If this is true,
then "the acceptance of Buddhism by a large portion of the generation
contemporary with its Founder was an adjudication as solemn and
authoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."The same could
be said of Mohammedanism, and, in fact, of every religion that has
ever benefited or cursed this world.This argument, when reduced to its
simplest form, is this: All that succeeds is inspired.The Morality in Christianity

The morality in Christianity has never opposed the freedom of thought.It has never put, nor tended to put, a chain on a human mind, nor a
manacle on a human limb; but the doctrines distinctively Christian--the
necessity of believing a certain thing; the idea that eternal punishment
awaited him who failed to believe; the idea that the innocent can suffer
for the guilty--these things have |opposed, and for a thousand years
substantially destroyed the freedom of the human mind.All religions
have, with ceremony, magic, and mystery, deformed, darkened, and
corrupted, the soul.Around the sturdy oaks of morality have grown and
clung the parasitic, poisonous vines of the miraculous and monstrous.Irenaeus assures us that all Christians possessed the power of
working miracles; that they prophesied, cast out devils, healed the
sick, and even raised the dead.Epiphanius asserts that some rivers
and fountains were annually transmuted into wine, in attestation of the
miracle of Cana, adding that he himself had drunk of these fountains.Augustine declares that one was told in a dream where the bones of
St.Stephen were buried and the bones were thus discovered and brought
to Hippo, and that they raised five dead persons to life, and that in
two years seventy miracles were performed with these relics.Justin
Martyr states that God once sent some angels to guard the human race,
that these angels fell in love with the daughters of men, and became the
fathers of innumerable devils.For hundreds of years miracles were
about the only things that happened.They were wrought by thousands of
Christians, and testified to by millions.The saints and martyrs, the
best and greatest, were the witnesses and workers of wonders.Even
heretics, with the assistance of the devil, could suspend the "laws
of nature."Must we believe these wonderful accounts because they were
written by "good men," by Christians," who made their statements in the
presence and expectation of death"?The truth is that these "good men"
were mistaken.They fed their minds on prodigies, and their imaginations
feasted on effects without causes.Doubts were regarded as "rude disturbers of the congregation."Credulity
and sanctity walked hand in hand.As the philosophy of the ancients was rendered almost worthless by the
credulity of the common people, so the proverbs of Christ, his religion
of forgiveness, his creed of kindness, were lost in the mist of miracle
and the darkness of superstition.The Honor Due to Christ

For the man Christ--for the reformer who loved his fellow-men--for the
man who believed in an Infinite Father, who would shield the innocent
and protect the just--for the martyr who expected to be rescued from the
cruel cross, and who at last, finding that his rope was dust, cried out
in the gathering gloom of death; "My God!--for that great and suffering man, mistaken though he was, I have
the highest admiration and respect.That man did not, as I believe,
claim a miraculous origin; he did not pretend to heal the sick nor raise
the dead.He claimed simply to be a man, and taught his fellow-men
that love is stronger far than hate.His life was written by reverent
ignorance.Loving credulity belittled his career with feats of jugglery
and magic art, and priests wishing to persecute and slay, put in his
mouth the words of hatred and revenge.The theological Christ is the
impossible union of the human and divine--man with the attributes of
God, and God with the limitations and weakness of man.Christianity has no Monopoly in Morals

The morality of the world is not distinctively Christian.Zoroaster,
Gautama, Mohammed, Confucius, Christ, and, in fact, all founders of
religions, have said to their disciples: You must not steal; You must
not murder; You must not bear false witness; You must discharge your
obligations.Christianity is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the
miraculous origin of Jesus Christ, his crucifixion, his resurrection,
his ascension, the inspiration of the Bible, the doctrine of the
atonement, and the necessity of belief.Buddhism is the ordinary moral
code, _plus_ the miraculous illumination of Buddha, the performance of
certain ceremonies, a belief in the transmigration of the soul, and
in the final absorption of the human by the infinite.The religion of
Mohammed is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the belief that Mohammed
was the prophet of God, total abstinence from the use of intoxicating
drinks, a harem for the faithful here and hereafter, ablutions, prayers,
alms, pilgrimages, and fasts.Old Age in Superstition's Lap

And here I take occasion to thank Mr.Black for having admitted that
Jehovah gave no commandment against the practice of polygamy, that he
established slavery, waged wars of extermination, and persecuted for
opinions' sake even unto death, Most theologians endeavor to putty,
patch, and paint the wretched record of inspired crime, but Mr.Black
has been bold enough and honest enough to admit the truth.In this age
of fact and demonstration it is refreshing to find a man who believes
so thoroughly in the monstrous and miraculous, the impossible and
immoral--who still clings lovingly to the legends of the bib and
rattle--who through the bitter experiences of a wicked world has kept
the credulity of the cradle, and finds comfort and joy in thinking about
the Garden of Eden, the subtile serpent, the flood, and Babel's tower,
stopped by the jargon of a thousand tongues--who reads with happy eyes
the story of the burning brimstone storm that fell upon the cities
of the plain, and smilingly explains the transformation of the
retrospective Mrs.Lot--who laughs at Egypt's plagues and Pharaoh's
whelmed and drowning hosts--eats manna with the wandering Jews, warms
himself at the burning bush, sees Korah's company by the hungry earth
devoured, claps his wrinkled hands with glee above the heathens'
butchered babes, and longingly looks back to the patriarchal days of
concubines and slaves.How touching when the learned and wise crawl back
in cribs and ask to hear the rhymes and fables once again!How charming
in these hard and scientific times to see old age in Superstition's lap,
with eager lips upon her withered breast!Ararat in Chicago

A little while ago, in the city of Chicago, a gentleman addressed a
number of Sunday-school children.In his address he stated that some
people were wicked enough to deny the story of the deluge; that he was
a traveler; that he had been to the top of Mount Ararat, and had brought
with him a stone from that sacred locality.The children were then
invited to form in procession and walk by the pulpit, for the purpose of
seeing this wonderful stone.After they had looked at it, the lecturer
said: "Now, children, if you ever hear anybody deny the story of the
deluge, or say that the ark did not rest on Mount Ararat, you can tell
them that you know better, because you have seen with your own eyes a
stone from that very mountain."How Gods and Devils are Made

It was supposed that God demanded worship; that he loved to be
flattered; that he delighted in sacrifice; that nothing made him happier
than to see ignorant faith upon its knees; that above all things he
hated and despised doubters and heretics, and regarded investigation as
rebellion.Each community felt it a duty to see that the enemies of God
were converted or killed.To allow a heretic to live in peace was
to invite the wrath of God.Every public evil--every misfortune--was
accounted for by something the community had permitted or done.When
epidemics appeared, brought by ignorance and welcomed by filth, the
heretic was brought out and sacrificed to appease the anger of God.By putting intention behind what man called good, God was produced.By
putting intention behind what man called bad, the Devil was created.Leave this "intention" out, and gods and devils fade away.If not a
human being existed, the sun would continue to shine, and tempest now
and then would devastate the earth; the rain would fall in pleasant
showers; violets would spread their velvet bosoms to the sun, the
earthquake would devour, birds would sing, and daisies bloom, and
roses blush, and volcanoes fill the heavens with their lurid glare; the
procession of the seasons would not be broken, and the stars would shine
as serenely as though the world were filled with loving hearts and happy
homes.The Romance of Figures

How long, according to the universal benevolence of the New Testament,
can a man be reasonably punished in the next world for failing to
believe something unreasonable in this?Can it be possible that any
punishment can endure forever?Suppose that every flake of snow that
ever fell was a figure nine, and that the first flake was multiplied by
the second, and that product by the third, and so on to the last flake.And then suppose that this total should be multiplied by every drop of
rain that ever fell, calling each drop a figure nine; and that total by
each blade of grass that ever helped to weave a carpet for the earth,
calling each blade a figure nine; and that again by every grain of sand
on every shore, so that the grand total would make a line of nines so
long that it would require millions upon millions of years for light,
traveling at the rate of one hundred and eighty-five thousand miles per
second, to reach the end.And suppose, further, that each unit in this
almost infinite total, stood for billions of ages--still that vast and
almost endless time, measured by all the years beyond, is as one flake,
one drop, one leaf, one blade, one grain, compared with all the flakes,
and drops, and leaves, and blades and grains.Upon love's breast the
Church has placed the eternal asp.And yet, in the same book in which is
taught this most infamous of doctrines, we are assured that "The Lord is
good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works."God and Zeno

If the Bible is inspired, Jehovah, God of all worlds, actually said:
"And if a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod, and he die under
his hand, he shall be surely punished; notwithstanding, if he continue
a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his money."And yet
Zeno, founder of the Stoics, centuries before Christ was born, insisted
that no man could be the owner of another, and that the title was bad,
whether the slave had become so by conquest, or by purchase.Jehovah,
ordered a Jewish general to make war, and gave, among others, this
command: "When the Lord thy God shall drive them before thee, thou shalt
smite them and utterly destroy them."And yet Epictetus, whom we have
already quoted, gave this marvelous rule for the guidance of human
conduct: "Live with thy inferiors as thou wouldst have thy superiors
live with thee."If Christ was in fact God, he knew all the future.Before him, like a
panorama, moved the history yet to be.He knew exactly how his words
would be interpreted.He knew what crimes, what horrors, what infamies,
would be committed in his name.He knew that the fires of persecution
would climb around the limbs of countless martyrs.He knew that brave
men would languish in dungeons, in darkness, filled with pain; that the
church would use instruments of torture, that his followers would appeal
to whip and chain.He must have seen the horizon of the future red with
the flames of the _auto da fe_.He knew all the creeds that would spring
like poison fungi from every text.He saw the sects waging war against
each other.He saw thousands of men, under the orders of priests,
building dungeons for their fellow-men.He heard the groans, saw the faces white with agony, the tears,
the blood--heard the shrieks and sobs of all the moaning, martyred
multitudes.He knew that commentaries would be written on his words with
swords, to be read by the light of fagots.He knew that the Inquisition
would be born of teachings attributed to him.He saw all the
interpolations and falsehoods that hypocrisy would write and tell.He
knew that above these fields of death, these dungeons, these burnings,
for a thousand years would float the dripping banner of the cross.He
knew that in his name his followers would trade in human flesh, that
cradles would be robbed and women's breasts unbabed for gold;--and yet
he died with voiceless lips.Why did he not
tell his disciples, and through them the world, that man should not
persecute, for opinion's sake, his fellow-man?Why did he not cry, You
shall not persecute in my name; you shall not burn and torment those who
differ from you in creed?Why did he not plainly say, I am the Son of
God?Why did he not explain the doctrine of the trinity?Why did he not
tell the manner of baptism that was pleasing to him?Why did he not say
something positive, definite, and satisfactory about another world?Why
did he not turn the tear-stained hope of heaven to the glad knowledge
of another life?Why did he go dumbly to his death, leaving the world to
misery and to doubt?The Philosophy of Action

Consequences determine the quality of an action.If consequences are
good, so is the action.If actions had no consequences, they would be
neither good nor bad.Man did not get his knowledge of the consequences
of actions from God, but from experience and reason.If man can, by
actual experiment, discover the right and wrong of actions, is it not
utterly illogical to declare that they who do not believe in God can
have no standard of right and wrong?Consequences are the standard by
which actions are judged.They are the children that testify as to the
real character of their parents.God or no God, larceny is the enemy of
industry--industry is the mother of prosperity--prosperity is a good,
and therefore larceny is an evil.God or no God, murder is a crime.There has always been a law against larceny, because the laborer wishes
to enjoy the fruit of his toil.As long as men object to being killed,
murder will be illegal.I have insisted, and I still insist, that it is still impossible for
a finite man to commit a crime deserving infinite punishment; and upon
this subject Mr.Black admits that "no revelation has lifted the veil
between time and eternity;" and, consequently, neither the priest nor
the "policeman" knows anything with certainty regarding another world.He simply insists that "in shadowy figures we are warned that a very
marked distinction will be made between the good and bad in the next
world."There is "a very marked distinction" in this; but there is this
rainbow in the darkest human cloud: The worst have hope of reform.All I
insist is, if there is another life, the basest soul that finds its way
to that dark or radiant shore will have the everlasting chance of
doing right.Nothing but the most cruel ignorance, the most heartless
superstition, the most ignorant theology, ever imagined that the
few days of human life spent here, surrounded by mists and clouds of
darkness, blown over life's sea by storms and tempests of passion, fixed
for all eternity the condition of the human race.If this doctrine be
true, this life is but a net, in which Jehovah catches souls for hell.We are told that "there is no good reason to doubt that the statements
of the Evangelists, as we have them now, are genuine."The fact is, no
one knows who made the "statements of the Evangelists."There are three
important manuscripts upon which the Christian world relies."The first
appeared in the catalogue of the Vatican, in 1475.Of the New, it contains the four gospels,--the Acts, the
seven Catholic Epistles, nine of the Pauline Epistles, and the
Epistle to the Hebrews, so far as the fourteenth verse of the ninth
chapter,"--and nothing more."The
second, the Alexandrine, was presented to King Charles the First, in
1628.It contains the Old and New Testaments, with some exceptions;
passages are wanting in Matthew, in John, and in II.It
also contains the Epistle of Clemens Romanus, a letter of Athanasius,
and the treatise of Eusebius on the Psalms."The last is the Sinaitic
Codex, discovered about 1850, at the Convent of St."It contains the Old and New Testaments, and in addition
the entire Epistle of Barnabas, and a portion of the Shepherd of
Hennas--two books which, up to the beginning of the fourth century, were
looked upon by many as Scripture."In this manuscript, or codex, the
gospel of St.Mark concludes with the eighth verse of the sixteenth
chapter, leaving out the frightful passage: "Go ye into all the world,
and preach the gospel to every creature.He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned."In
matters of the utmost importance these manuscripts disagree, but even if
they all agreed it would not furnish the slightest evidence of their
truth.It will not do to call the statements made in the gospels
"depositions," until it is absolutely established who made them, and the
circumstances under which they were made.Neither can we say that "they
were made in the immediate prospect of death," until we know who made
them.It is absurd to say that "the witnesses could not have been
mistaken, because the nature of the facts precluded the possibility of
any delusion about them."Can it be pretended that the witnesses could
not have been mistaken about the relation the Holy Ghost is alleged to
have sustained to Jesus Christ?Is there no possibility of delusion
about a circumstance of that kind?Did the writers of the four gospels
have "the sensible and true avouch of their own eyes and ears" in that
behalf?How was it possible for any one of the four Evangelists to know
that Christ was the Son of God, or that he was God?Matthew says that an angel of the Lord told
Joseph in a dream, but Joseph never wrote an account of this wonderful
vision.Luke tells us that the angel had a conversation with Mary, and
that Mary told Elizabeth, but Elizabeth never wrote a word.There is no
account of Mary, or Joseph, or Elizabeth, or the angel, having had any
conversation with Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, in which one word was
said about the miraculous origin of Jesus Christ.The persons who knew
did not write, so that the account is nothing but hearsay.Black pretend that such statements would be admitted as evidence in any
court?But how do we know that the disciples of Christ wrote a word of
the gospels?How do we know
that the writers of the gospels "were men of unimpeachable character?"Black's Admission

For the purpose of defending the character of his infallible God, Mr.Black is forced to defend religious intolerance, wars of extermination,
human slavery, and almost polygamy.He admits that God established
slavery; that he commanded his chosen people to buy the children of the
heathen; that heathen fathers and mothers did right to sell their girls
and boys; that God ordered the Jews to wage wars of extermination and
conquest; that it was right to kill the old and young; that God forged
manacles for the human brain; that he commanded husbands to murder their
wives for suggesting the worship of the sun or moon; and that every
cruel, savage passage in the Old Testament was inspired by him.Such is
a "policeman's" view of God.The Stars Upon the Door of France

Mr.Black justifies all the crimes and horrors, excuses all the tortures
of all the Christian years, by denouncing the cruelties of the French
Revolution.Thinking people will not hasten to admit that an infinitely
good being authorized slavery in Judea, because of the atrocities of the
French Revolution.They will remember the sufferings of the Huguenots.They will not forget
the countless cruelties of priest and king.They will not forget the
dungeons of the Bastile.They will know that the Revolution was an
effect, and that liberty was not the cause--that atheism was not the
cause.Behind the Revolution they will see altar and throne--sword and
fagot--palace and cathedral--king and priest--master and slave--tyrant
and hypocrite.They will see that the excesses, the cruelties, and
crimes were but the natural fruit of seeds the church had sown.Upon that cloud of war, black with
the myriad miseries of a thousand years, dabbled with blood of king and
queen, of patriot and priest, there was this bow: "Beneath the flag of
France all men are free."In spite of all the blood and crime, in spite
of deeds that seem insanely base, the People placed upon a Nation's brow
these stars:--Liberty, Fraternity, Equality--grander words than ever
issued from Jehovah's lips.A KIND WORD FOR JOHN CHINAMAN

On the 27th day of March, 1880, Messrs.Wright, Dickey, O'Conner, and
Murch, of the Select Committee appointed by Congress to "Consider
the causes of the present depression of labor," presented the majority
special report on Chinese Immigration.The following quotations are
excerpts from Col.R. G. Ingersoll's caustic review of that report.The Select Committee Afraid

These gentlemen are in great fear for the future of our most holy and
perfectly authenticated religion, and have, like faithful watchmen,
from the walls and towers of Zion, hastened to give the alarm.They have
informed Congress that "Joss has his temple of worship in the Chinese
quarters, in San Francisco.Within the walls of a dilapidated structure
is exposed to the view of the faithful the God of the Chinaman, and here
are his altars of worship, Here he tears up his pieces of paper; here he
offers up his prayers; here he receives his religious consolations,
and here is his road to the celestial land."That "Joss is located in a
long, narrow room, in a building in a back alley, upon a kind of altar;"
that "he is a wooden image, looking as much like an alligator as like a
human being;" that the Chinese "think there is such a place as heaven;"
that "all classes of Chinamen worship idols;" that "the temple is open
every day at all hours;" that "the Chinese have no Sunday;" that this
heathen god has "huge jaws, a big red tongue, large white teeth, a half
dozen arms, and big, fiery, eyeballs.About him are placed offerings of
meat, and other eatables--a sacrificial offering."The Gods of the Joss-House and Patmos

No wonder that these members of the committee were shocked at such a
god, knowing as they did, that the only true God was correctly described
by the inspired lunatic of Patmos in the following words: "And there sat
in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the Son of
Man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps
with a golden girdle.His head and his hairs were white like wool, as
white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; and his feet like
unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the
sound of many waters.And he had in his right hand seven stars; and out
of his mouth went a sharp, two-edged sword; and his countenance was as
the sun shining in his strength."Certainly, a large mouth, filled
with white teeth, is preferable to one used as the scabbard of a sharp,
two-edged sword.Why should these gentlemen object to a god with big
fiery eyeballs, when their own Deity has eyes like a flame of fire?A Little Too Late

Is it not a little late in the day to object to people because they
sacrifice meat and other eatables to their god?We all know, that for
thousands of years the "real" God was exceedingly fond of roasted meat;
that He loved the savor of burning flesh, and delighted in the perfume
of fresh warm blood.Christianity has a Fair Show in San Francisco

The world is also informed by these gentlemen that "the idolatry of
the Chinese produces a demoralizing effect upon our American youth by
bringing sacred things into disrespect and making religion a theme of
disgust and contempt."In San Francisco there are some three hundred
thousand people.Is it possible that a few Chinese can bring "our holy
religion" into disgust and contempt?In that city there are fifty times
as many churches as joss-houses.Scores of sermons are uttered every
week; religious books and papers are plentiful as leaves in autumn, and
somewhat dryer; thousands of bibles are within the reach of all.An Arrow from the Quiver of Satire

And there, too, is the example of a Christian city.Why should we send
missionaries to China, if we cannot convert the heathen when they come
here?When missionaries go to a foreign land the poor benighted people
have to take their word for the blessings showered upon a Christian
people; but when the heathen come here, they can see for themselves.What was simply a story becomes a demonstrated fact.They come in
contact with people who love their enemies.They see that in a Christian
land men tell the truth; that they will not take advantage of strangers;
that they are just and patient; kind and tender; and have no prejudice
on account of color, race or religion; that they look upon mankind as
brethren; that they speak of God as a Universal Father, and are
willing to work and even to suffer, for the good, not only of their own
countrymen, but of the heathen as well.All this the Chinese see and
know, and why they still cling to the religion of their country is, to
me, a matter of amazement.We Have no Religious System

I take this, the earliest opportunity, to inform these gentlemen
composing a majority of the committee, that we have in the United States
no "religious system;" that this is a secular government.That it has
no religious creed; that it does not believe nor disbelieve in a future
state of reward or punishment; that it neither affirms nor denies the
existence of a "living" God.Congress Nothing to Do with Religion

Congress has nothing to do with the religion of the people.Its members
are not responsible to God for the opinions of their constituents, and
it may tend to the happiness of the constituents for me to state that
they are in no way responsible for the religion of the members.Religion
is an individual, not a national matter.And where the nation interferes
with the right of conscience, the liberties of the people are devoured
by the monster Superstition.But I am astonished that four Christian statesmen, four members of
Congress in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, who seriously
object to people on account of their religious convictions, should
still assert that the very religion in which they believe--and the only
religion established by the living god-head of the American system--is
not adapted to the spiritual needs of one-third of the human race.It is
amazing that these four gentlemen have, in the defense of the Christian
religion, announced the discovery that it is wholly inadequate for
the civilization of mankind; that the light of the cross can never
penetrate the darkness of China; "that all the labors of the missionary,
the example of the good, the exalted character of our civilization, make
no impression upon the pagan life of the Chinese;" and that even
the report of this committee will not tend to elevate, refine and
Christianize the yellow heathen of the Pacific coast.In the name
of religion these gentlemen have denied its power and mocked at the
enthusiasm of its founder.Worse than this, they have predicted for the
Chinese a future of ignorance and idolatry in this world, and, if the
"American system" of religion is true, hell-fire in the next.Do not Trample on John Chinaman

Do not trample upon these people because they have a different
conception of things about which even this committee knows nothing.Give them the same privilege you enjoy of making a God after their own
fashion.Would you be willing
to have them remain, if one of their race, thousands of years ago, had
pretended to have seen God, and had written of him as follows: "There
went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth; coals
were kindled by it, * * * and he rode upon a cherub and did fly."Why
should you object to these people on account of their religion?Your
objection has in it the spirit of hate and intolerance.That spirit lighted the fagot, made the
thumb-screw, put chains upon the limbs, and lashes upon the backs of
men.The same spirit bought and sold, captured and kidnapped human
beings; sold babes, and justified all the horrors of slavery.Be Honest with the Chinese

If you wish to drive out the Chinese, do not make a pretext of religion.Do not pretend that you are trying to do God a favor.Injustice in his
name is doubly detestable.The assassin cannot sanctify his dagger by
falling on his knees, and it does not help a falsehood if it be uttered
as a prayer.Religion, used, to intensify the hatred of men toward men,
under the pretense of pleasing God, has cursed this world.An Honest Merchant the Best Missionary

I am almost sure that I have read somewhere that "Christ died for _all_
men," and that "God is no respecter of persons."It was once taught
that it was the duty of Christians to tell to all people the "tidings of
great joy."I have never believed these things myself, but have always
contended that an honest merchant was the best missionary.Commerce
makes friends, religion makes enemies; the one enriches, and the other
impoverishes; the one thrives best where the truth is told, the other
where falsehoods are believed.For myself, I have but little confidence
in any business, or enterprise, or investment, that promises dividends
only after the death of the stockholders.Good Words from Confucius

For the benefit of these four philosophers and prophets, I will give a
few extracts from the writings of Confucius that will, in my judgment,
compare favorably with the best passages of their report:

"My doctrine is that man must be true to the principles of his nature,
and the benevolent exercises of them toward others.""With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and with my bended arm
for a pillow, I still have joy.""Riches and honor acquired by injustice are to me but floating clouds.""The man who, in view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who, in view of
danger, forgets life; and who remembers an old agreement, however far
back it extends, such a man may be reckoned a complete man.""Recompense injury with justice, and kindness with kindness."There is one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's
life: Reciprocity is that word.The Ancient Chinese

When the ancestors of the four Christian Congressmen were barbarians,
when they lived in caves, gnawed bones, and worshiped dry snakes; the
infamous Chinese were reading these sublime sentences of Confucius.When
the forefathers of these Christian statesmen were hunting toads to
get the jewels out of their heads to be used as charms, the wretched
Chinamen were calculating eclipses, and measuring the circumference
of the earth.When the progenitors of these representatives of the
"American system of religion" were burning women charged with nursing
devils, these people "incapable of being influenced by the exalted
character of our civilization," were building asylums for the insane.The Chinese and Civil Service Reform

Neither should it be forgotten that, for thousands of years, the Chinese
have honestly practised the great principle known as civil service
reform--a something that even the administration of Mr.Hayes has
reached only through the proxy of promise.Invading China in the Name of Opium and Christ

The English battered down the door of China in the names of Opium and
Christ.This infamy was regarded as another triumph of the gospel.At last in self-defense the Chinese allowed Christians to touch their
shores.Their wise men, their philosophers, protested, and prophesied
that time would show that Christians could not be trusted.This re port
proves that the wise men were not only philosophers but prophets.Don't be Dishonest in the Name of God

Treat China as you would England.Change it if you will, according to the laws of nations, but on no
account excuse a breach of national faith by pretending that we are
dishonest for God's sake.CONCERNING CREEDS AND THE TYRANNY OF SECTS




482.Diversity of Opinion Abolished by Henry VIII

In the reign of Henry VIII--that pious and moral founder of the
apostolic Episcopal Church,--there was passed by the parliament
of England an act entitled, "An act for abolishing of diversity of
opinion."And in this act was set forth what a good Christian was
obliged to believe:

First, That in the sacrament was the real body and blood of Jesus
Christ.Second, That the body and blood of Jesus Christ was in the bread, and
the blood and body of Jesus Christ was in the wine.Fourth, That vows of chastity were of perpetual obligation.Fifth, That private masses ought to be continued; and,

Sixth, That auricular confession to a priest must be maintained.This creed was made by law, in order that all men might know just what
to believe by simply reading the statute.The Church hated to see the
people wearing out their brains in thinking upon these subjects.Spencer and Darwin Damned

According to the philosophy of theology, man has continued to degenerate
for six thousand years.To teach that there is that in nature which
impels to higher forms and grander ends, is heresy, of course.The
Deity will damn Spencer and his "Evolution," Darwin and his "Origin
of Species," Bastian and his "Spontaneous Generation," Huxley and his
"Protoplasm," Tyndall and his "Prayer Gauge," and will save those, and
those only, who declare that the universe has been cursed, from the
smallest atom to the grandest star; that everything tends to evil and to
that only, and that the only perfect thing in nature is the Presbyterian
Confession of Faith.The Dead do Not Persecute

Imagine a vine that grows at one end and decays at the other.The
end that grows is heresy, the end that rots is orthodox.The dead are
orthodox, and your cemetery is the most perfect type of a well regulated
church.No thought, no progress, no heresy there.Slowly and silently,
side by side, the satisfied members peacefully decay.There is only this
difference--the dead do not persecute.The Atheist a Legal Outcast in Illinois

The supreme court of Illinois decided, in the year of grace 1856, that
an unbeliever in the existence of an intelligent First Cause could not
be allowed to testify in any court.His wife and children might have
been murdered before his very face, and yet in the absence of other
witnesses, the murderer could not have even been indicted.To him, Justice was not only blind, but deaf.He
was liable, like other men, to support the government, and was forced to
contribute his share towards paying the salaries of the very judges
who decided that under no circumstances could his voice be heard in any
court.This was the law of Illinois, and so remained until the adoption
of the new Constitution By such infamous means has the Church endeavored
to chain the human mind, and protect the majesty of her God.How the Owls Hoot

Now and then somebody examines, and in spite of all keeps his manhood,
and has the courage to follow where his reason leads.Then the pious
get together and repeat wise saws, and exchange knowing nods and most
prophetic winks.The stupidly wise sit owl-like on the dead limbs of the
tree of knowledge, and solemnly hoot.The Fate of Theological Students

Thousands of young men are being educated at this moment by the various
Churches.In order that they may be prepared to investigate
the phenomena by which we are surrounded?The object, and the only
object, is that they may be prepared to defend a creed; that they may
learn the arguments of their respective churches, and repeat them in
the dull ears of a thoughtless congregation.If one, after being thus
trained at the expense of the Methodists, turns Presbyterian or Baptist,
he is denounced as an ungrateful wretch.Honest investigation is utterly
impossible within the pale of any Church, for the reason, that if you
think the Church is right you will not investigate, and if you think it
wrong, the Church will investigate you.The consequence of this is,
that most of the theological literature is the result of suppression, of
fear, tyranny and hypocrisy.Trials for Heresy

A trial for heresy means that the spirit of persecution still lingers in
the Church; that it still denies the right of private judgment; that it
still thinks more of creed than truth, and that it is still determined
to prevent the intellectual growth of man.It means the churches are
shambles in which are bought and sold the souls of men.It means that
the Church is still guilty of the barbarity of opposing thought with
force.It means that if it had the power, the mental horizon would be
bound by a creed; that it would bring again the whips and chains and
dungeon keys, the rack and fagot of the past.Presbyterianism Softening

Fortunately for us, civilization has had a softening effect even upon
the Presbyterian Church.To the ennobling influence of the arts and
sciences the savage spirit of Calvinism has, in some slight degree,
succumbed.True, the old creed remains substantially as it was written,
but by a kind of tacit understanding it has come to be regarded as a
relic of the past.The cry of "heresy" has been growing fainter and
fainter, and, as a consequence, the ministers of that denomination
have ventured, now and then, to express doubts as to the damnation of
infants, and the doctrine of total depravity.The Methodist "Hoist with his own Petard."A few years ago a Methodist clergyman took it upon himself to give me a
piece of friendly advice."Although you may disbelieve the bible," said
he, "you ought not to say so."Do
you believe the bible," said I. He replied, "Most assuredly."To which
I retorted, "Your answer conveys no information to me.You may be
following your own advice.Of
course a man who will advise others to dissimulate will not always be
particular about telling the truth himself."The Precious Doctrine of Total Depravity

What a precious doctrine is that of the total depravity of the human
heart!How sweet it is to believe that the lives of all the good and
great were continual sins and perpetual crimes; that the love a mother
bears her child is, in the sight of God, a sin; that the gratitude of
the natural heart is simple meanness; that the tears of pity are impure;
that for the unconverted to live and labor for others is an offense to
heaven; that the noblest aspirations of the soul are low and groveling
in the sight of God.Guilty of Heresy

Whoever has an opinion of his own, and honestly expresses it, will be
guilty of heresy.Heresy is what the minority believe; it is the name
given by the powerful to the doctrine of the weak.This word was born of
the hatred, arrogance and cruelty of those who love their enemies, and
who, when smitten on one cheek, turn the other.This word was born of
intellectual slavery in the feudal ages of thought.It was an epithet
used in the place of argument.From the commencement of the Christian
era, every art has been exhausted and every conceivable punishment
inflicted to force all people to hold the same religious opinions.This
effort was born of the idea that a certain belief was necessary to the
salvation of the soul.One great trouble is that most teachers are dishonest.They teach as
certainties those things concerning which they entertain doubts.They
do not say, "we _think_ this is so," but "we _know_ this is so."They do
not appeal to the reason of the pupil, but they command his faith.They
keep all doubts to themselves; they do not explain, they assert.In all ages reason has been regarded as the enemy of religion.Nothing
has been considered so pleasing to the Deity as a total denial of the
authority of your own mind.Self-reliance has been thought a deadly
sin; and the idea of living and dying without the aid and consolation
of superstition has always horrified the Church.By some unaccountable
infatuation, belief has been and still is considered of immense
importance.All religions have been based upon the idea that God will
forever reward the true believer, and eternally damn the man who doubts
or denies.Belief is regarded as the one essential thing.To practice
justice, to love mercy, is not enough.You must believe in some
incomprehensible creed.You must say, "Once one is three, and three
times one is one."The man who practiced every virtue, but failed to
believe, was execrated.Nothing so outrages the feelings of the Church
as a moral unbeliever--nothing so horrible as a charitable Atheist.A Hundred and Fifty Years Ago

One hundred and fifty years ago the foremost preachers would have
perished at the stake.A Universalist would have been torn in pieces in
England, Scotland, and America.Unitarians would have found themselves
in the stocks, pelted by the rabble with dead cats, after which their
ears would have been cut off, their tongues bored, and their foreheads
branded.The Despotism of Faith

The despotism of faith is justified upon the ground that Christian
countries are the grandest and most prosperous of the world.At one time
the same thing could have been truly said in India, in Egypt, in Greece,
in Rome, and in every other country that has, in the history of the
world, swept to empire.This argument proves too much not only, but the
assumption upon which it is based is utterly false.Believe, or Beware

And what does a trial for heresy mean?It means that the Church says
a heretic, "Believe as I do, or I will withdraw my support.I will pursue you until your garments are rags; until your
children cry for bread; until your cheeks are furrowed with tears.I
will hunt you to the very portals of the grave."Calvin's Petrified Heart

Luther denounced mental liberty with all the coarse and brutal vigor
of his nature; Calvin despised, from the very bottom of his petrified
heart, anything that even looked like religious toleration, and solemnly
declared that to advocate it was to crucify Christ afresh.All the
founders of all the orthodox churches have advocated the same infamous
tenet.The truth is, that what is called religion is necessarily
inconsistent with free thought.Must one be versed in Latin before he is entitled to express his opinion
as to the genuineness of a pretended revelation from God?Common sense
belongs exclusively to no tongue.Logic is not confined to, nor has it
been buried with, the dead languages.Paine attacked the bible as it is
translated.If the translation is wrong, let its defenders correct it.A gentleman, walking among the ruins of Athens came upon a fallen statue
of Jupiter; making an exceedingly low bow he said: "O Jupiter!He then added: "Should you ever sit upon the throne of heaven
again, do not, I pray you, forget that I treated you politely when you
were prostrate."The Tail of a Lion

There is no saying more degrading than this: "It is better to be the
tail of a lion than the head of a dog."It is a responsibility to think
and act for yourself.Most people hate responsibility; therefore they
join something and become the tail of some lion.They say, "My party
can act for me--my church can do my thinking.It is enough for me to
pay taxes and obey the lion to which I belong, without troubling myself
about the right, the wrong, or the why or the wherefore."While the Preachers Talked the People Slept

The fact is, the old ideas became a little monotonous to the people.The
fall of man, the scheme of redemption and irresistible grace, began
to have a familiar sound.The preachers told the old stories while the
congregations slept.Some of the ministers became tired of these stories
themselves.The five points grew dull, and they felt that nothing short
of irresistible grace could bear this endless repetition.The outside
world was full of progress, and in every direction men advanced, while
the church, anchored to a creed, idly rotted at the shore.Christianity no Friend to Progress

Christianity has always opposed every forward movement of the human
race.Across the highway of progress it has always been building
breastworks of bibles, tracts, commentaries, prayer-books, creeds,
dogmas and platforms, and at every advance the Christians have gathered
together behind these heaps of rubbish and shot the poisoned arrows of
malice at the soldiers of freedom.You may be laughed at in this world for insisting that God put Adam into
a deep sleep and made a woman out of one of his ribs, but you will be
crowned and glorified in the next.You will also have the pleasure of
hearing the gentlemen howl there, who laughed at you here.While you
will not be permitted to take any revenge, you will be allowed to
smilingly express your entire acquiescence in the will of God.The one was lost, and the other has not
been found.The Real Eden is Beyond

Nations and individuals fail and die, and make room for higher forms.The intellectual horizon of the world widens as the centuries pass.Ideals grow grander and purer; the difference between justice and mercy
becomes less and less; liberty enlarges, and love intensifies as the
years sweep on.The ages of force and fear, of cruelty and wrong, are
behind us and the real Eden is beyond.It is said that a desire for
knowledge lost us the Eden of the past; but whether that is true or not,
it will certainly give us the Eden of the future.Party Names Belittle Men

Let us forget that we are Baptists, Methodists, Catholics,
Presbyterians, or Free-thinkers, and remember only that we are men and
women.After all, man and woman are the highest possible titles.All
other names belittle us, and show that we have, to a certain extent,
given up our individuality.A FEW PLAIN QUESTIONS




507.On which of the six days was he
created?Is it possible that God would make a successful
rival?He must have known that Adam and Eve would fall.He knew what
a snake with a "spotted, dappled skin" could do with an inexperienced
woman.He knew that if the serpent
got into the garden, Adam and Eve would sin, that he would have to drive
them out, that afterwards the world would be destroyed, and that he
himself would die upon the cross.Must We Believe Fables to be Good and True?Must we, in order to be
good, gentle and loving in our lives, believe that the creation of woman
was a second thought?That Jehovah really endeavored to induce Adam to
take one of the lower animals as an helpmeet for him?After all, is it
not possible to live honest and courageous lives without believing these
fables?Why was not the serpent kept out of the garden?Why did not the Lord God
take him by the tail and snap his head off?Why did he not put Adam
and Eve on their guard about this serpent?They, of course, were not
acquainted in the neighborhood, and knew nothing about the serpent's
reputation.Questions About the Ark

How was the ark kept clean?We know how it was ventilated; but what
was done with the filth?How were some
portions of the ark heated for animals from the tropics, and others
kept cool for the polar bears?How did the animals get back to their
respective countries?Some had to creep back about six thousand miles,
and they could only go a few feet a day.Some of the creeping things
must have started for the ark just as soon as they were made, and kept
up a steady jog for sixteen hundred years.Think of a couple of the
slowest snails leaving a point opposite the ark and starting for the
plains of Shinar, a distance of twelve thousand miles.Going at the rate
rate of a mile a month, it would take them a thousand years.Polar bears must have gone several thousand miles, and
so sudden a change in climate must have been exceedingly trying upon
their health.Of course, all the polar
bears did not go.It could be confounded only by the
destruction of memory.Did God destroy the memory of mankind at
that time, and if so, how?Did he paralyze that portion of the brain
presiding over the organs of articulation, so that they could not speak
the words, although they remembered them clearly, or did he so touch
the brain that they could not hear?Will some theologian, versed in
the machinery of the miraculous, tell us in what way God confounded the
language of mankind?Would God Kill a Man for Making Ointment?Can we believe that the real God, if there is one, ever ordered a man
to be killed simply for making hair oil, or ointment?We are told in
the thirtieth chapter of Exodus, that the Lord commanded Moses to take
myrrh, cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia, and olive oil, and make a
holy ointment for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle, tables,
candlesticks and other utensils, as well as Aaron and his sons; saying,
at the same time, that whosoever compounded any like it, or whoever put
any of it on a stranger, should be put to death.In the same chapter,
the Lord furnishes Moses with a recipe for making a perfume, saying,
that whoever should make any which smelled like it, should be cut off
from his people.This, to me, sounds so unreasonable that I cannot
believe it.Some Christians say that the fountains of the great deep were broken up.Will they be kind enough to tell us what the fountains of the great deep
are?Others say that God had vast stores of water in the center of the
earth that he used on the occasion of the flood.How did these waters
happen to run up hill?Would a Real God Uphold Slavery?Must we believe that God called some of his children the money of
others?Can we believe that God made lashes upon the naked back, a
legal tender for labor performed?Must we regard the auction block as an
altar?Were the
stealers and whippers of babes and women the justified children of God?Will some minister, who now believes in religious liberty, and
eloquently denounces the intolerance of Catholicism, explain these
things; will he tell us why he worships an intolerant God?Is a god who
will burn a soul forever in another world, better than a christian who
burns the body for a few hours in this?Do the angels all discuss questions on the same side?Are all the
investigators in perdition?Will the penitent thief, winged and crowned,
laugh at the honest folks in hell?Will the agony of the damned increase
or decrease the happiness of God?Will there be, in the universe, an
eternal _auto da fe_?Why should a believer in God hate an atheist?Surely the atheist has
not injured God, and surely he is human, capable of joy and pain, and
entitled to all the rights of man.Would it not be far better to treat
this atheist, at least, as well as he treats us?ORIENT PEARLS AS RANDOM STRUNG

I do not believe that Christians are as bad as their creeds.The highest crime against a creed is to change it.A believer is a bird in a cage, a free-thinker is an eagle parting the
clouds with tireless wing.All that is good in our civilization is the result of commerce, climate,
soil, geographical position.The heretics have not thought and suffered and died in vain.Every
heretic has been, and is, a ray of light.No man ever seriously attempted to reform a Church without being cast
out and hunted down by the hounds of hypocrisy.After all, the poorest bargain that a human being can make, is to give
his individuality for what is called respectability.On every hand are the enemies of individuality and mental freedom.Custom meets us at the cradle and leaves us only at the tomb.There can be nothing more utterly subversive of all that is really
valuable than the suppression of honest thought.No man, worthy of the form he bears, will at the command of Church or
State solemnly repeat a creed his reason scorns.Although we live in what is called a free government,--and politically
we are free,--there is but little religious liberty in America.According to orthodox logic, God having furnished us with imperfect
minds, has a right to demand a perfect result.Nearly all people stand in great horror of annihilation, and yet to give
up your individuality is to annihilate yourself.When women reason, and babes sit in the lap of philosophy, the victory
of reason over the shadowy host of darkness will be complete.Of all the religions that have been produced by the egotism, the malice,
the ignorance and ambition of man, Presbyterianism is the most hideous.And what man who really thinks can help repeating the words of Ennius:
"If there are gods they certainly pay no attention to the affairs of
man."Events, like the pendulum of a clock have swung forward and backward,
but after all, man, like the hands, has gone steadily on.In spite of Church and dogma, there have been millions and millions of
men and women true to the loftiest and most generous promptings of the
human heart.I was taught to hate Catholicism with every drop of my blood, it is only
justice to say, that in all essential particulars it is precisely the
same as every other religion.Wherever brave blood has been shed, the sword of the Church has been
wet.On every chain has been the sign of the cross.The altar and throne
have leaned against and supported each other.We have all been taught by the Church that nothing is so well calculated
to excite the ire of the Deity as to express a doubt as to his
existence, and that to deny it is an unpardonable sin.Universal obedience is universal stagnation; disobedience is one of the
conditions of progress.Select any age of the world and tell me what
would have been the effect of implicit obedience.We have no national religion, and no national God; but every citizen
is allowed to have a religion and a God of his own, or to reject all
religions and deny the existence of all gods.Whatever may be the truth upon any subject has nothing to do with our
right to investigate that subject, and express any opinion we may form.All that I ask, is the same right I freely accord to all others.Mental slavery is mental death, and every man who has given up his
intellectual freedom is the living coffin of his dead soul.In this
sense, every church is a cemetery and every creed an epitaph.Think of reading the 109th Psalm to a heathen who has a Bible of his own
in which is found this passage: "Blessed is the man and beloved of all
the gods, who is afraid of no man, and of whom no man is afraid."The trouble with most people is, they bow to what is called authority;
they have a certain reverence for the old because it is old.They think
a man is better for being dead, especially if he has been dead a long
time.We should all remember that to be like other people is to be unlike
ourselves, and that nothing can be more detestable in character than
servile imitation.The great trouble with imitation is, that we are apt
to ape those who are in reality far below us.Suppose the Church had had absolute control of the human mind at any
time, would not the words liberty and progress have been blotted from
human speech?In defiance of advice, the world has advanced.Over every fortress of tyranny has waved, and still waves, the banner of
the Church.The Church has won no victories for the rights of man.We have advanced in spite of religious zeal, ignorance, and opposition.Luther labored to reform the Church--Voltaire, to reform men.There have been, and still are, too many men who own themselves--too
much thought, too much knowledge for the Church to grasp again the
sword of power.For the Eg-lon of superstition
Science has a message from Truth.It is a blessed thing that in every age some one has had individuality
enough and courage enough to stand by his own convictions,--some one
who had the grandeur to say his say."The Church says the earth is flat; but I have seen its shadow on the
moon, and I have more confidence even in a shadow than in the Church.""On the prow of his ship were disobedience, defiance, scorn, and
success.INGERSOLL'S ORATION AT HIS BROTHER'S GRAVE

     A Tribute to Ebon C. Ingersoll, by his Brother
     Robert--The Record of a Generous Life Runs
     Like a  Vine Around the Memory of our
     Dead,   and   Every   Sweet,   Unselfish
     Act is Now a Perfumed Flower.Dear Friends: I am going to do that which the dead oft promised he would
do for me.The loved and loving brother, husband, father, friend, died where
manhood's morning almost touches noon, and while the shadows still were
falling toward the west.He had not passed on life's highway the stone that marks the highest
point; but, being weary for a moment, he lay down by the wayside, and,
using his burden for a pillow, fell into that dreamless sleep that
kisses down his eyelids still.While yet in love with life and raptured
with the world, he passed to silence and pathetic dust.Yet, after all, it may be best, just in the happiest, sunniest hour
of all the voyage, while eager winds are kissing every sail, to dash
against the unseen rock, and in an instant hear the billows roar above a
sunken ship For whether in mid sea or '<DW41> the breakers of the farther
shore, a wreck at last must mark the end of each and all.And every
life, no matter if its every hour is rich with love and every moment
jeweled with a joy, will, at its close, become a tragedy as sad and deep
and dark as can be woven of the warp and woof of mystery and death.This brave and tender man in every storm of life was oak and rock; but
in the sunshine he was vine and flower.He was the friend of all heroic
souls.He climbed the heights, and left all superstitions far below,
while on his forehead fell the golden dawning of the grander day.He loved the beautiful, and was with color, form, and music touched to
tears.He sided with the weak, the poor, and wronged, and lovingly
gave alms.With loyal heart and with the purest hands he faithfully
discharged all public trusts.He was a worshiper of liberty, a friend of the oppressed.A thousand
times I have heard him quote these words: "For Justice all place a
temple, and all season, summer."He believed that happiness was the only
good, reason the only torch, justice the only worship, humanity the only
religion, and love the only priest.He added to the sum of human joy;
and were every one to whom he did some loving service to bring a blossom
to his grave, he would sleep to-night beneath a wilderness of sweet
flowers.Life is a narrow vale between the cold and barren peaks of two
eternities.We strive in vain to look beyond the heights.We cry aloud,
and the only answer is the echo of our wailing cry.From the voiceless
lips of the unreplying dead there comes no word; but in the night of
death hope sees a star and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing.He who sleeps here, when dying, mistaking the approach of death for the
return of health, whispered with his latest breath, "I am better now."Let us believe, in spite of doubts and dogmas, of fears and tears, that
these dear words are true of all the countless dead.And now, to you, who have been chosen, from among the many men he loved,
to do the last sad office for the dead, we give his sacred dust.There was, there is, no gentler,
stronger, manlier man.INGERSOLL'S DREAM OF THE WAR

     The Following Words of Matchless Eloquence were
     Addressed by Col.Ingersoll to the Veteran
     Soldiers of Indianapolis.The past, as it were, rises before me like a dream.Again we are in the
great struggle for national life.We hear the sound of preparation--the
music of the boisterous drums--the silver voices of heroic bugles.We
see thousands of assemblages, and hear the appeals of orators; we see
the pale cheeks of women, and the flushed faces of men; and in those
assemblages we see all the dead whose dust we have covered with flowers.We are with them when they enlist in the
great army of freedom.Some are
walking for the last time in quiet, woody places with the maidens they
adore.We hear the whisperings and the sweet vows of eternal love as
they lingeringly part forever.Others are bending over cradles kissing
babes that are asleep.Some are parting with
mothers who hold them and press them to their hearts again and again,
and say nothing; and some are talking with wives, and endeavoring with
brave words spoken in the old tones to drive away the awful fear.We see the wife standing in the door with the babe in her
arms--standing in the sunlight sobbing--at the turn of the road a hand
waves--she answers by holding high in her loving hands the child.We see them all as they march proudly away under the flaunting flags,
keeping time to the wild music of war--marching down the streets of the
great cities--through the towns and across the prairies--down to the
fields of glory, and do and to die for the eternal right.We are by their side on all the gory
fields, in all the hospitals of pain--on all the weary marches.We stand
guard with them in the wild storm and under the quiet stars.We are with
them in ravines running with blood--in the furrows of old fields.We are
with them between contending hosts, unable to move, wild with thirst,
the life ebbing slowly away among the withered leaves.We see them
pierced by balls and torn with shells in the trenches of forts, and in
the whirlwind of the charge, where men become iron with nerves of steel.We are with them in the prisons of hatred and famine, but human speech
can never tell what they endured.We are at home when the news comes that they are dead.We see the maiden
in the shadow of her sorrow.We see the silvered head of the old man
bowed with the last grief.The past rises before us, and we see four millions of human beings
governed by the lash--we see them bound hand and foot--we hear the
strokes of cruel whips--we see the hounds tracking women through
tangled swamps.We see babes sold from the breasts of mothers.Four million bodies in chains--four million souls in fetters.All the
sacred relations of wife, mother, father and child trampled beneath the
brutal feet of might.All this was done under our own beautiful banner
of the free.We hear the roar and shriek of the bursting
shell.Instead of
slaves we see men and women and children.The wand of progress touches
the auction-block, the slave-pen, and the whipping-post, and we see
homes and firesides, and school-houses and books, and where all was want
and crime, and cruelty and fear, we see the faces of the free.They died for liberty--they died for us.They
are at rest, They sleep in the land they made free, under the flag
they rendered stainless, under the solemn pines, the sad hemlocks, the
tearful willows, the embracing vines.They sleep beneath the shadows of
the clouds, careless alike of sunshine or storm, each in the window-less
palace of rest.Earth may run red with other wars--they are at peace.In
the midst of battle, in the roar of conflict, they found the serenity of
death.I have one sentiment for the soldiers living and dead--cheers for
the living and tears for the dead.It is not necessary to be a pig in order to raise one.A blow from a parent leaves a scar on the soul of the child.A mortgage casts a shadow on the sunniest field.Agriculture is the basis of all wealth.It is better to be a whole farmer than part of a mechanic.One good school-master is worth a thousand priests.Out in the intellectual sea there is room for every sail.An honest God is the noblest work of man.A King is a non-producing thief, sitting on a throne, surrounded by
vermin.Whiskey is the son of villainies, the father of all crimes, the mother
of all abominations, the devil's best friend, and God's worst enemy.An Orthodox Man is a gentleman petrified in his mind.Chicago is a marvel of energy, a miracle of nerva

The Pulpit is a pillory.Civilization is the Child of Forethought

Prejudice is the Child of Ignorance.I believe in the democracy of the fireside, in the republicanism of the
home.I believe in truth, in
investigation, in forethought.I believe in the gospel of education, of cheerfulness, of justice and
intelligence.FAITHFULLY TRANSLATED FROM THE

                                TO THE

                         PRESENT TRANSLATION.The excellence of the following Treatise is so well known to all in any
tolerable degree conversant with the Art of Painting, that it would be
almost superfluous to say any thing respecting it, were it not that it
here appears under the form of a new translation, of which some account
may be expected.Of the original Work, which is in reality a selection from the
voluminous manuscript collections of the Author, both in folio and
quarto, of all such passages as related to Painting, no edition
appeared in print till 1651, though its Author died so long before as
the year 1519; and it is owing to the circumstance of a manuscript
copy of these extracts in the original Italian, having fallen into
the hands of Raphael du Fresne; that in the former of these years
it was published at Paris in a thin folio volume in that language,
accompanied with a set of cuts from the drawings of Nicolo Poussin, and
Alberti; the former having designed the human figures, the latter the
geometrical and other representations.This precaution was probably
necessary, the sketches in the Author's own collections being so very
slight as not to be fit for publication without further assistance.Poussin's drawings were mere outlines, and the shadows and back-grounds
behind the figures were added by Errard, after the drawings had been
made, and, as Poussin himself says, without his knowledge.In the same year, and size, and printed at the same place, a
translation of the original work into French was given to the world by
Monsieur de Chambray (well known, under his family name of Freart, as
the author of an excellent Parallel of ancient and modern Architecture,
in French, which Mr.de Chambray, being thought, some years after, too
antiquated, some one was employed to revise and modernise it; and in
1716 a new edition of it, thus polished, came out, of which it may be
truly said, as is in general the case on such occasions, that whatever
the supposed advantage obtained in purity and refinement of language
might be, it was more than counterbalanced by the want of the more
valuable qualities of accuracy, and fidelity to the original, from
which, by these variations, it became further removed.The first translation of this Treatise into English, appeared in the
year 1721.It does not declare by whom it was made; but though it
professes to have been done from the original Italian, it is evident,
upon a comparison, that more use was made of the revised edition of
the French translation.Indifferent, however, as it is, it had become
so scarce, and risen to a price so extravagant, that, to supply the
demand, it was found necessary, in the year 1796, to reprint it as it
stood, with all its errors on its head, no opportunity then offering of
procuring a fresh translation.This last impression, however, being now also disposed of, and a new
one again called for, the present Translator was induced to step
forward, and undertake the office of fresh translating it, on finding,
by comparing the former versions both in French and English with
the original, many passages which he thought might at once be more
concisely and more faithfully rendered.His object, therefore, has
been to attain these ends, and as rules and precepts like the present
allow but little room for the decorations of style, he has been more
solicitous for fidelity, perspicuity, and precision, than for smooth
sentences, and well-turned periods.Nor was this the only advantage which it was found the present
opportunity would afford; for the original work consisting in fact of
a number of entries made at different times, without any regard to
their subjects, or attention to method, might rather in that state be
considered as a chaos of intelligence, than a well-digested treatise.It has now, therefore, for the first time, been attempted to place
each chapter under the proper head or branch of the art to which
it belongs; and by so doing, to bring together those which (though
related and nearly connected in substance) stood, according to the
original arrangement, at such a distance from each other as to make
it troublesome to find them even by the assistance of an index; and
difficult, when found, to compare them together.The consequence of this plan, it must be confessed, has been, that in
a few instances the same precept has been found in substance repeated;
but this is so far from being an objection, that it evidently proves
the precepts were not the hasty opinions of the moment, but settled and
fixed principles in the mind of the Author, and that he was consistent
in the expression of his sentiments.But if this mode of arrangement
has in the present case disclosed what might have escaped observation,
it has also been productive of more material advantages; for, besides
facilitating the finding of any particular passage (an object in itself
of no small importance), it clearly shews the work to be a much more
complete system than those best acquainted with it, had before any idea
of, and that many of the references in it apparently to other writings
of the same Author, relate in fact only to the present, the chapters
referred to having been found in it.These are now pointed out in the
notes, and where any obscurity has occurred in the text, the reader
will find some assistance at least attempted by the insertion of a note
to solve the difficulty.No pains or expense have been spared in preparing the present work
for the press.The cuts have been re-engraven with more attention
to correctness in the drawing, than those which accompanied the two
editions of the former English translation possessed (even though they
had been fresh engraven for the impression of 1796); and the diagrams
are now inserted in their proper places in the text, instead of being,
as before, collected all together in two plates at the end.Besides
this, a new Life of the Author has been also added by a Friend of the
Translator, the materials for which have been furnished, not from vague
reports, or uncertain conjectures, but from memoranda of the Author
himself, not before used.Fortunately for this undertaking, the manuscript collections of
Leonardo da Vinci, which have lately passed from Italy into France,
have, since their removal thither, been carefully inspected, and
an abstract of their contents published in a quarto pamphlet,
printed at Paris in 1797, and intitled, "Essai sur les Ouvrages
physico-mathematiques de Leonard de Vinci;" by J. B. Venturi, Professor
of Natural Philosophy at Modena; a Member of the Institute of Bologna,
&c. From this pamphlet a great deal of original intelligence respecting
the Author has been obtained, which, derived as it is from his own
information, could not possibly be founded on better evidence.To this Life we shall refer the reader for a further account of the
origin and history of the present Treatise, conceiving we have already
effected our purpose, by here giving him a sufficient idea of what he
is to expect from the ensuing pages.THE LIFE

                                  OF

                         _LEONARDO DA VINCI_.Leonardo da Vinci, the Author of the following Treatise, was the
natural son of Pietro da Vinci, a notary of Vinci, in Tuscany[i1], a
village situated in the valley of Arno, a little below Florence, and
was born in the year 1452[i2].Having discovered, when a child, a strong inclination and talent for
painting, of which he had given proofs by several little drawings and
sketches; his father one day accidentally took up some of them, and
was induced to shew them to his friend Andrea Verocchio, a painter
of some reputation in Florence, who was also a chaser, an architect,
a sculptor, and goldsmith, for his advice, as to the propriety of
bringing up his son to the profession of painting, and the probability
of his becoming eminent in the art.The answer of Verocchio was such as
to confirm him in that resolution; and Leonardo, to fit him for that
purpose, was accordingly placed under the tuition of Verocchio[i3].As Verocchio combined in himself a perfect knowledge of the arts of
chasing and sculpture, and was a deep proficient in architecture,
Leonardo had in this situation the means and opportunity of acquiring a
variety of information, which though perhaps not immediately connected
with the art to which his principal attention was to be directed,
might, with the assistance of such a mind as Leonardo's, be rendered
subsidiary to his grand object, tend to promote his knowledge of the
theory, and facilitate his practice of the profession for which he
was intended.Accordingly we find that he had the good sense to avail
himself of these advantages, and that under Verocchio he made great
progress, and attracted his master's friendship and confidence, by the
talents he discovered, the sweetness of his manners, and the vivacity
of his disposition[i4].Of his proficiency in painting, the following
instance is recorded; and the skill he afterwards manifested in other
branches of science, on various occasions, evidently demonstrated how
solicitous he had been for knowledge of all kinds, and how careful in
his youth to lay a good foundation.Verocchio had undertaken for the
religious of Vallombrosa, without Florence, a picture of our Saviour's
Baptism by St.John, and consigned to Leonardo the office of putting
in from the original drawing, the figure of an angel holding up the
drapery; but, unfortunately for Verocchio, Leonardo succeeded so well,
that, despairing of ever equalling the work of his scholar, Verocchio
in disgust abandoned his pencil for ever, confining himself in future
solely to the practice of sculpture[i5].On this success Leonardo became sensible that he no longer stood in
need of an instructor; and therefore quitting Verocchio, he now began
to work and study for himself.Many of his performances of this period
are still, or were lately to be seen at Florence; and besides these,
the following have been also mentioned: A cartoon of Adam and Eve in
the Garden, which he did for the King of Portugal[i6].This is highly
commended for the exquisite gracefulness of the two principal figures,
the beauty of the landscape, and the incredible exactitude of the
shrubs and fruit.At the instance of his father, he made a painting for
one of his old neighbours at Vinci[i7]; it consisted wholly of such
animals as have naturally an hatred to each other, joined artfully
together in a variety of attitudes.Some authors have said that this
painting was a shield[i8], and have related the following particulars
respecting it.One of Pietro's neighbours meeting him one day at Florence, told him he
had been making a shield, and would be glad of his assistance to get it
painted; Pietro undertook this office, and applied to his son to make
good the promise.When the shield was brought to Leonardo, he found it
so ill made, that he was obliged to get a turner to smooth it; and when
that was done, he began to consider with what subject he should paint
it.For this purpose he got together, in his apartment, a collection of
live animals, such as lizards, crickets, serpents, silk-worms, locusts,
bats, and other creatures of that kind, from the multitude of which,
variously adapted to each other, he formed an horrible and terrific
animal, emitting fire and poison from his jaws, flames from his eyes,
and smoke from his nostrils; and with so great earnestness did Leonardo
apply to this, that though in his apartment the stench of the animals
that from time to time died there, was so strong as to be scarcely
tolerable, he, through his love to the art, entirely disregarded it.The work being finished, Leonardo told his father he might now see it;
and the father one morning coming to his apartment for that purpose,
Leonardo, before he admitted him, placed the shield so as to receive
from the window its full and proper light, and then opened the door.Not knowing what he was to expect, and little imagining that what he
saw was not the creatures themselves, but a mere painted representation
of them, the father, on entering and beholding the shield, was at first
staggered and shocked; which the son perceiving, told him he might now
send the shield to his friend, as, from the effect which the sight of
it had then produced, he found he had attained the object at which he
aimed.Pietro, however, had too much sagacity not to see that this was
by much too great a curiosity for a mere countryman, who would never
be sensible of its value; he therefore privately bought for his friend
an ordinary shield, rudely painted with the device of an heart with an
arrow through it, and sold this for an hundred ducats to some merchants
at Florence, by whom it was again sold for three hundred to the Duke of
Milan[i9].He afterwards painted a picture of the Virgin Mary, and by her side a
vessel of water, in which were flowers: in this he so contrived it, as
that the light reflected from the flowers threw a pale redness on the
water.This picture was at one time in the possession of Pope Clement
the Seventh[i10].For his friend Antonio Segni he also made a design, representing
Neptune in his car, drawn by sea-horses, and attended by tritons and
sea-gods; the heavens overspread with clouds, which were driven in
all directions by the violence of the winds; the waves appeared to be
rolling, and the whole ocean seemed in an uproar[i11].This drawing was
afterwards given by Fabio the son of Antonio Segni, to Giovanni Gaddi,
a great collector of drawings, with this epigram:

    Pinxit Virgilius Neptunum, pinxit Homerus,
      Dum maris undisoni per vada flectit equos.Mente quidem vates illum conspexit uterque,
      Vincius est oculis, jureque vincit eos[i12].In English thus:

    Virgil and Homer, when they Neptune shew'd,
      As he through boist'rous seas his steeds compell'd,
    In the mind's eye alone his figure view'd;
      But Vinci _saw_ him, and has both excell'd[i13].To these must be added the following: A painting representing two
horsemen engaged in fight, and struggling to tear a flag from
each other: rage and fury are in this admirably expressed in the
countenances of the two combatants; their air appears wild, and the
drapery is thrown into an unusual though agreeable disorder.A Medusa's
head, and a picture of the Adoration of the Magi[i14].In this last
there are some fine heads, but both this and the Medusa's head are said
by Du Fresne to have been evidently unfinished.The mind of Leonardo was however too active and capacious to be
contented solely with the practical part of his art; nor could it
submit to receive as principles, conclusions, though confirmed
by experience, without first tracing them to their source, and
investigating their causes, and the several circumstances on which
they depended.For this purpose he determined to engage in a deep
examination into the theory of his art; and the better to effect his
intention, he resolved to call in to his aid the assistance of all such
other branches of science as could in any degree promote this grand
object.Vasari has related[i15], that at a very early age he had, in the short
time of a few months only that he applied to it, obtained a deep
knowledge of arithmetic; and says, that in literature in general, he
would have made great attainments, if he had not been too versatile
to apply long to one subject.In music, he adds, he had made some
progress; that he then determined to learn to play on the lyre; and
that having an uncommonly fine voice, and an extraordinary promptitude
of thought and expression, he became a celebrated _improvisatore_: but
that his attention to these did not induce him to neglect painting
and modelling in which last art he was so great a proficient, that
in his youth he modelled in clay some heads of women laughing, and
also some boys' heads, which appeared to have come from the hand of a
master.In architecture, he made many plans and designs for buildings,
and, while he was yet young, proposed conveying the river Arno into
the canal at Pisa[i16].Of his skill in poetry the reader may judge
from the following sonnet preserved by Lomazzo[i17], the only one now
existing of his composition; and for the translation with which it is
accompanied we are indebted to a lady.Chi non puo quel vuol, quel che puo voglia,
        Che quel che non si puo folle e volere.Adunque saggio e l'uomo da tenere,
    Che da quel che non puo suo voler toglia.Pero ch'ogni diletto nostro e doglia
        Sta in si e no, saper, voler, potere,
        Adunque quel sol puo, che co 'l dovere
    Ne trahe la ragion suor di sua soglia.Ne sempre e da voler quel che l'uom puote,
        Spesso par dolce quel che torna amaro,
        Piansi gia quel ch'io volsi, poi ch'io l'ebbi.Adunque tu, lettor di queste note,
        S'a te vuoi esser buono e a' gli altri caro,
        Vogli sempre poter quel che tu debbi.The man who cannot what he would attain,
    Within his pow'r his wishes should restrain:
    The wish of Folly o'er that bound aspires,
    The wise man by it limits his desires.Since all our joys so close on sorrows run,
    We know not what to choose or what to shun;
    Let all our wishes still our duty meet,
    Nor banish Reason from her awful seat.Nor is it always best for man to will
    Ev'n what his pow'rs can reach; some latent ill
    Beneath a fair appearance may delude
    And make him rue what earnest he pursued.Then, Reader, as you scan this simple page,
    Let this one care your ev'ry thought engage,
    (With self-esteem and gen'ral love 't is fraught,)
    Wish only pow'r to do just what you ought.The course of study which Leonardo had thus undertaken, would, in its
most limited extent by any one who should attempt it at this time, be
found perhaps almost more than could be successfully accomplished;
but yet his curiosity and unbounded thirst for information, induced
him rather to enlarge than contract his plan.Accordingly we find,
that to the study of geometry, sculpture, anatomy, he added those of
architecture, mechanics, optics, hydrostatics, astronomy, and Nature in
general, in all her operations[i18]; and the result of his observations
and experiments, which were intended not only for present use, but
as the basis and foundation of future discoveries, he determined, as
he proceeded, to commit to writing.At what time he began these his
collections, of which we shall have occasion to speak more particularly
hereafter, is no where mentioned; but it is with certainty known, that
by the month of April 1490, he had already completely filled two folio
volumes[i19].Notwithstanding Leonardo's propensity and application to study, he was
not inattentive to the graces of external accomplishments; he was very
skilful in the management of an horse, rode gracefully, and when he
afterwards arrived to a state of affluence, took particular pleasure in
appearing in public well mounted and handsomely accoutred.He possessed
great dexterity in the use of arms: for mien and grace he might contend
with any gentleman of his time: his person was remarkably handsome,
his behaviour so perfectly polite, and his conversation so charming,
that his company was coveted by all who knew him; but the avocations to
which this last circumstance subjected him, are one reason why so many
of his works remain unfinished[i20].With such advantages of mind and body as these, it was no wonder that
his reputation should spread itself, as we find it soon did, over all
Italy.The painting of the shield before mentioned, had already, as has
been noticed, come into the possession of the Duke of Milan; and the
subsequent accounts which he had from time to time heard of Leonardo's
abilities and talents, induced Lodovic Sforza, surnamed the Moor,
then Duke of Milan, about, or a little before the year 1489[i21], to
invite him to his court, and to settle on him a pension of five hundred
crowns, a considerable sum at that time[i22].Various are the reasons assigned for this invitation: Vasari[i23]
attributes it to his skill in music, a science of which the Duke is
said to have been fond; others have ascribed it to a design which the
Duke entertained of erecting a brazen statue to the memory of his
father[i24]; but others conceive it originated from the circumstance,
that the Duke had not long before established at Milan an academy for
the study of painting, sculpture, and architecture, and was desirous
that Leonardo should take the conduct and direction of it[i25].The
second was, however, we find, the true motive; and we are further
informed, that the invitation was accepted by Leonardo, that he went to
Milan, and was already there in 1489[i26].Among the collections of Leonardo still existing in manuscript, is a
copy of a memorial presented by him to the Duke about 1490, of which
Venturi has given an abridgment[i27].In it he offers to make for the
Duke military bridges, which should be at the same time light and very
solid, and to teach him the method of placing and defending them with
security.When the object is to take any place, he can, he says, empty
the ditch of its water; he knows, he adds, the art of constructing a
subterraneous gallery under the ditches themselves, and of carrying
it to the very spot that shall be wanted.If the fort is not built
on a rock, he undertakes to throw it down, and mentions that he has
new contrivances for bombarding machines, ordnance, and mortars, some
adapted to throw hail shot, fire, and smoke, among the enemy; and
for all other machines proper for a siege, and for war, either by
sea or land, according to circumstances.In peace also, he says he
can be useful in what concerns the erection of buildings, conducting
of water-courses, sculpture in bronze or marble, and painting; and
remarks, that at the same time that he may be pursuing any of the above
objects, the equestrian statue to the memory of the Duke's father, and
his illustrious family, may still be going on.If any one doubts the
possibility of what he proposes, he offers to prove it by experiment,
and ocular demonstration.From this memorial it seems clear, that the casting of the bronze
statue was his principal object; painting is only mentioned
incidentally, and no notice is taken of the direction or management of
the academy for painting, sculpture, and architecture; it is probable,
therefore, that at this time there was no such intention, though it is
certainly true, that he was afterwards placed at the head of it, and
that he banished from it the barbarous style of architecture which till
then had prevailed in it, and introduced in its stead a more pure and
classical taste.Whatever was the fact with respect to the academy, it
is however well known that the statue was cast in bronze, finished, and
put up at Milan, but afterwards demolished by the French when they took
possession of that place[i28] after the defeat of Lodovic Sforza.Some time after Leonardo's arrival at Milan, a design had been
entertained of cutting a canal from Martesana to Milan, for the purpose
of opening a communication by water between these two places, and, as
it is said, of supplying the last with water.It had been first thought
of so early as 1457[i29]; but from the difficulties to be expected in
its execution, it seems to have been laid aside, or at least to have
proceeded slowly, till Leonardo's arrival.His offers of service as
engineer in the above memorial, probably induced Lodovic Sforza, the
then Duke, to resume the intention with vigour, and accordingly we
find the plan was determined on, and the execution of it intrusted to
Leonardo.The object was noble, but the difficulties to be encountered
were sufficient to have discouraged any mind but Leonardo's; for the
distance was no less than two hundred miles; and before it could be
completed, hills were to be levelled, and vallies filled up, to render
them navigable with security[i30].In order to enable him to surmount the obstacles with which he
foresaw he should have to contend, he retired to the house of his
friend Signior Melzi, at Vaverola, not far distant from Milan, and
there applied himself sedulously for some years, as it is said, but
at intervals only we must suppose, and according as his undertaking
proceeded, to the study of philosophy, mathematics, and every branch
of science that could at all further his design; still continuing
the method he had before adopted, of entering down in writing
promiscuously, whatever he wished to implant in his memory: and at
this place, in this and his subsequent visits from time to time, he is
supposed to have made the greater part of the collections he has left
behind him[i31], of the contents of which we shall hereafter speak more
at large.Although engaged in the conduct of so vast an undertaking, and in
studies so extensive, the mind of Leonardo does not appear to have
been so wholly occupied or absorbed in them as to incapacitate him
from attending at the same time to other objects also; and the Duke
therefore being desirous of ornamenting Milan with some specimens of
his skill as a painter, employed him to paint in the refectory of the
Dominican convent of Santa Maria delle Gratie, in that city, a picture,
the subject of which was to be the Last Supper.Of this picture it
is related, that Leonardo was so impressed with the dignity of the
subject, and so anxious to answer the high ideas he had formed of it in
his own mind, that his progress was very slow, and that he spent much
time in meditation and thought, during which the work was apparently
at a stand.The Prior of the convent, thinking it therefore neglected,
complained to the Duke; but Leonardo assuring the Duke that not less
than two hours were every day bestowed on it, he was satisfied.Nevertheless the Prior, after a short time, finding the work very
little advanced, once more applied to the Duke, who in some degree of
anger, as thinking Leonardo had deceived him, reprimanded him in strong
terms for his delay.What Leonardo had scorned to urge to the Prior in
his defence, he now thought fit to plead in his excuse to the Duke, to
convince him that a painter did not labour solely with his hands, but
that his mind might be deeply studying his subject, when his hands were
unemployed, and he in appearance perfectly idle.In proof of this, he
told the Duke that nothing remained to the completion of the picture
but the heads of our Saviour and Judas; that as to the former, he had
not yet been able to find a fit model to express its divinity, and
found his invention inadequate of itself to represent it: that with
respect to that of Judas, he had been in vain for two years searching
among the most abandoned and profligate of the species for an head
which would convey an idea of his character; but that this difficulty
was now at length removed, since he had nothing to do but to introduce
the head of the Prior, whose ingratitude for the pains he was taking,
rendered him a fit archetype of the perfidy and ingratitude he wished
to express.Some persons have said[i32], that the head of Judas in the
picture was actually copied from that of the Prior; but Mariette denies
it, and says this reply was merely intended as a threat[i33].A difference of opinion has also prevailed concerning the head
of our Saviour in this picture; for some have conceived it left
intentionally unfinished[i34], while others think there is a gradation
of resemblance, which increasing in beauty in St.John and our Saviour,
shews in the dignified countenance of the latter a spark of his divine
majesty.In the countenance of the Redeemer, say these last, and in
that of Judas, is excellently expressed the extreme idea of God made
man, and of the most perfidious of mortals.This is also pursued in the
characters nearest to each of them[i35].Little judgment can now be formed of the original beauty of this
picture, which has been, and apparently with very good reason, highly
commended.Unfortunately, though it is said to have been in oil, the
wall on which it was painted not having been properly prepared, the
original colours have been so effectually defaced by the damp, as
to be no longer visible[i36]; and the fathers, for whose use it was
painted, thinking it entirely destroyed, and some years since wishing
to heighten and widen a door under it, leading out of their refectory,
have given a decided proof of their own want of taste, and how little
they were sensible of its value, by permitting the workmen to break
through the wall on which it was painted, and, by so doing, entirely
to destroy the lower part of the picture[i37].The injury done by the
damp to the colouring has been, it is true, in some measure repaired by
Michael Angelo Bellotti, a painter of Milan, who viewing the picture
in 1726, made an offer to the Prior and convent to restore, by means
of a secret which he possessed, the original colours.His proposition
being accepted, and the experiment succeeding beyond their hopes, the
convent made him a present of five hundred pounds for his labour, and
he in return communicated to them the secret by which it had been
effected[i38].Deprived, as they certainly are by these events, of the means of
judging accurately of the merit of the original, it is still some
consolation to the lovers of painting, that several copies of it made
by Leonardo's scholars, many of whom were very able artists, and at a
time when the picture had not been yet injured, are still in existence.A list of these copies is given by P. M. Guglielmo della Valle, in his
edition of Vasari's Lives of the Painters, in Italian, vol.34,
and from him it is here inserted in the note[i39].Francis the First
was so charmed on viewing the original, that not being able to remove
it, he had a copy made, which is now, or was some years since, at St.Germains, and several prints have been published from it; but the best
which has yet appeared (and very fine it is) is one not long since
engraven by Morghen, at Rome, impressions of which have found their way
into this country, and been sold, it is said, for ten or twelve guineas
each.In the same refectory of the Dominicans at Milan is, or was, also
preserved a painting by Leonardo, representing Duke Lodovic, and
Beatrix his duchess, on their knees; done no doubt about this
time[i40].And at or near this period, he also painted for the Duke the
Nativity, which was formerly, and may perhaps be still, in the Emperor
of Germany's collection[i41].As Leonardo's principal aim, whenever he was left at liberty to pursue
the bent of his own inclination, seems to have been progressive
improvement in the art of painting, he appears to have sedulously
embraced all opportunities of increasing his information; and wisely
perceiving, that without a thorough acquaintance with anatomy, a
painter could effect but little, he was particularly desirous of
extending his knowledge in that branch.For that purpose he had
frequent conferences on the subject with Marc Antonio della Torre,
professor of anatomy at Pavia[i42], and not only was present at many
dissections performed by him, but made abundance of anatomical drawings
from Nature, many of which were afterwards collected into a volume by
his scholar Francisco Melzi[i43].Such perseverance and assiduity as Leonardo's, united as they were
with such uncommon powers as his, had already formed many artists at
that time of distinguished reputation, but who afterwards became still
more famous, and might probably have rendered Milan the repository
of some of the most valuable specimens of painting, and raised it to
a rank little, if at all, inferior to that which Florence has since
held with the admirers of the polite arts, had it not happened that by
the disastrous termination of a contest between the Duke of Milan and
the French, all hopes of further improvement were entirely cut off;
and Milan, at one blow, lost all the advantages of which it was even
then in possession.For about this time the troubles in Italy began
to break in on Leonardo's quiet, and he found his patron, the Duke,
engaged in a war with the French for the possession of his dukedom;
which not only endangered the academy, but ultimately deprived him both
of his dominions and his liberty; as the Duke was, in 1500, completely
defeated, taken prisoner, and carried into France, where, in 1510, he
died a prisoner in the castle of Loches[i44].By this event of the Duke's defeat, and the consequent ruin of the
Sforza family, all further progress in the canal of Martesana, of which
much still remained to be done[i45], was put a stop to; the academy
of architecture and painting was entirely broken up; the professors
were turned adrift, and the arts banished from Milan, which at one
time had promised to have been their refuge and principal feat[i46].Italy in general was, it is true, a gainer by the dispersion of so many
able and deeply instructed artists as issued from this school, though
Milan suffered; for nothing could so much tend to the dissemination
of knowledge as the mixing such men among others who needed that
information in which these excelled.Among the number thus separated
from each other, we find painters, carvers, architects, founders,
and engravers in crystal and precious stones, and the names of the
following have been given, as the principal: Cesare da Sesto, Andrea
Salaino, Gio.Antonio Boltraffio, Bernardino Lovino, Bartolommeo della
Porta, Lorenzo Lotto[i47].Paolo Lomazzo;
but Della Valle, in a note in his edition of Vasari, vol.34,
says this last was a disciple of Gio.Battista della Cerva, and not of
Leonardo.Du Fresne mentions besides the above, Francis Melzi, Mark
Uggioni Gobbo, an extraordinary painter and carver; Annibal Fontana,
a worker in marble and precious stones; and Bernazzano, an excellent
painter of landscapes; but omits Della Porta, and Lorenzo Lotto.In 1499, the year before Duke Lodovic's defeat, Leonardo being at
Milan, was employed by the principal inhabitants to contrive an
automaton for the entertainment of Lewis XII.King of France, who was
expected shortly to make a public entry into that city.This Leonardo
did, and it consisted of a machine representing a lion, whose inside
was so well constructed of clockwork, that it marched out to meet the
King, made a stand when it came before him, reared up on its hinder
legs, and opening its breast, presented an escutcheon with fleurs de
lis quartered on it[i48].Lomazzo has said that this machine was made
for the entry of Francis the First; but he is mistaken, that prince
having never been at Milan till the year 1515[i49], at which time
Leonardo was at Rome.Compelled by the disorders of Lombardy, the misfortunes of his patron,
and the ruin of the Sforza family, to quit Milan, Leonardo betook
himself to Florence, and his inducements to this resolution seem to
have been the residence there of the Medici family, the great patrons
of arts, and the good taste of its principal inhabitants[i50], rather
than its vicinity to the place of his birth; for which, under the
circumstances that attended that event, it is not probable he could
entertain much, if any predilection.The first work which he here
undertook was a design for an altar-piece for the chapel of the college
of the Annunciati.Its subject was, our Saviour, with his mother, St.John; but though this drawing is said to have rendered
Leonardo very popular among his countrymen, to so great a degree, that
numbers of people went to see it, it does not appear that any picture
was painted from it, nor that the undertaking ever proceeded farther
than a sketch of a design, or rather, perhaps, a finished drawing.When
Leonardo some years afterwards went into France[i51], Francis the First
was desirous of having a picture from this drawing, and at his desire
he then put it into colours; but whether even this last was a regular
picture, or, which is more probable, only a  drawing, we are
not informed.The picture, however, on which he bestowed the most time and labour,
and which therefore seems intended by him as the completest specimen of
his skill, at least in the branch of portrait-painting, was that which
he did of Mona Lisa, better known by the appellation of la Gioconda, a
Florentine lady, the wife of Francisco del Giocondo.It was painted for
her husband, afterwards purchased by Francis the First, and was till
lately to be seen in the King of France's cabinet.Leonardo bestowed
four entire years upon it, and after all is said to have left it
unfinished[i52].This has been so repeatedly said of the works of this painter, that we
are here induced to inquire into the evidence of the fact.An artist
who feels by experience, as every one must, how far short of the ideas
of perfection he has formed in his own mind, his best performances
always fall, will naturally be led to consider these as but very
faint expressions of his own conceptions.Leonardo's disposition to
think nothing effected while any thing remained to be done, and a
mind like his, continually suggesting successive improvements, might
therefore, and most probably did produce in him an opinion that his own
most laboured pieces were far from being finished to that extent of
beauty which he wished to give them; and these sentiments of them he
might in all likelihood be frequently heard to declare.Comparing his
productions, however, with those of other masters, they will be found,
notwithstanding this assertion to the contrary, as eminent in this
particular also, as for the more valuable qualities of composition,
drawing, character, expression, and colouring.About the same time with this of la Gioconda, he painted the portraits
of a nobleman of Mantua, and of la Ginevra, a daughter of Americus
Benci[i53], much celebrated for her beauty; and is said to have
finished a picture of Flora some years since remaining at Paris[i54];
but this last Mariette discovered to be the work of Melzio, from the
circumstance of finding, on a close inspection, the name of this last
master written on it[i55].In the year 1503, he was elected by the Florentines to paint their
council-chamber.The subject he chose for this, was the battle against
Attila[i56]; and he had already made some progress in his work,
when, to his great mortification, he found his colours peel from the
wall[i57].With Leonardo was joined in this undertaking, Michael Angelo, who
painted another side of the room, and who, then a young man of not
more than twenty-nine, had risen to such reputation, as not to fear a
competition with Leonardo, a man of near sixty[i58].The productions of
two such able masters placed in the same room, begun at the same time,
and proceeding gradually step by step together, afforded, no doubt,
occasion and opportunity to the admirers and critics in painting to
compare and contrast with each other their respective excellencies and
defects.Had these persons contented themselves simply with comparing
and appreciating the merits of these masters according to justice and
truth, it might perhaps have been advantageous to both, as directing
their attention to the correction of errors; but as each artist had his
admirers, each had also his enemies; the partisans of the one thinking
they did not sufficiently value the merit of their favourite if they
allowed any to his antagonist, or did not, on the contrary, endeavour
to crush by detraction the too formidable reputation of his adversary.From this conduct was produced what might easily have been foreseen;
they first became jealous rivals, and at length open and inveterate
enemies[i59].Leonardo's reputation, which had been for many years gradually
increasing, was now so firmly established, that he appears to have been
looked up to as being, what he really was, the reviver and restorer of
the art of painting; and to such an height had the curiosity to view
his works been excited, that Raphael, who was at that time young, and
studying, thought it worth his while to make a journey to Florence in
the month of October 1504[i60], on purpose to see them.Nor was his
labour lost, or his time thrown away in so doing; for on first seeing
the works of Leonardo's pencil, he was induced to abandon the dry and
hard manner of his master Perugino's colouring, and to adopt in its
stead the style of Leonardo[i61], to which circumstance is owing no
small portion of that esteem in the art, to which Raphael afterwards
very justly arrived.His father having died in 1504[i62], he in consequence of that event
became engaged with his half-brothers, the legitimate sons of Pietro
da Vinci, in a law-suit for the recovery of a share of his father's
property, which in a letter from Florence to the Governor of Milan,
the date of which does not appear, he speaks of having almost brought
to a conclusion[i63].At Florence he continued from 1503 to 1507[i64],
and in the course of that time painted, among other pictures of less
note, a Virgin and Child, once in the hands of the Botti family; and
a Baptist's head, formerly in those of Camillo Albizzi[i65]; but in
1508, and the succeeding year, he was at Milan, where he received a
pension which had been granted him by Lewis XII.[i66]; and in the
month of September 1513, he, in company with his scholar Francesco
Melzi, quitted Milan[i67], and set out for Rome (which till that
time he had never visited), encouraged perhaps to this resolution by
the circumstance that his friend Cardinal John de Medicis, who was
afterwards known by the assumed name of Leo X. had a few months before
been advanced to the papacy[i68].His known partiality to the arts, and
the friendship which had subsisted between him and Leonardo, held out
to the latter a well-founded expectation of employment for his pencil
at Rome, and we find in this expectation he was not deceived; as, soon
after his arrival, the Pope actually signified his intention of setting
him to work.Upon this Leonardo began distilling oils for his colours,
and preparing varnishes, which the Pope hearing, said pertly and
ignorantly enough, that he could expect nothing from a man who thought
of finishing his works before he had begun them[i69].Had the Pope
known, as he seems not to have done, that oil was the vehicle in which
the colours were to have been worked, or been witness either to the
almost annihilation of the colours in Leonardo's famous picture of the
Last Supper, owing to the damp of the wall, or to the peeling of the
colours from the wall in the council-chamber at Florence, he probably
would have spared this ill-natured reflection.If it applied at all,
it could only be to a very small part of the pursuit in which Leonardo
was occupied, namely, preparing varnish; and if age were necessary
to give the varnish strength, or it were the better for keeping, the
answer was in an equal degree both silly and impertinent; and it is no
wonder it should disgust such a mind as Leonardo's, or produce, as we
find it did, such a breach between the Pope and him, that the intended
pictures, whatever they might have been, were never begun.Disgusted with his treatment at Rome, where the former antipathy
between him and Michael Angelo was again revived by the partisans of
each, he the next year quitted it; and accepting an invitation which
had been made him by Francis the First, he proceeded into France[i70].At the time of this journey he is said to have been seventy years
old[i71], which cannot be correct, as he did not live to attain that
age in the whole.Probably the singularity of his appearance (for in
his latter years he permitted his beard to grow long), together with
the effect which his intense application to study had produced in his
constitution, might have given rise to an opinion that he was older
than he really was; and indeed it seems pretty clear, that when he
arrived in France he was nearly worn out in body, if not in mind,
by the anxiety and application with which he had pursued his former
studies and investigations.Although the King's motive to this invitation, which seems to have been
a wish to profit by the pencil of Leonardo, was completely disappointed
by his ill state of health, which the fatigues of his journey and the
change of the climate produced, so that on his arrival in France no
hopes could be entertained by the King of enriching his collection
with any pictures by Leonardo; yet the French people in general, and
the King in particular, are expressly said to have been as favourable
to him as those of Rome had been injurious, and he was received by the
King in the most affectionate manner.It was however unfortunately too
soon evident that these symptoms of decay were only the forerunners of
a more fatal distemper under which for several months he languished,
but which by degrees was increasing upon him.Of this he was sensible,
and therefore in the beginning of the year 1518, he determined to make
his will, to which he afterwards added one or more codicils.By these
he first describes himself as Leonardo da Vinci, painter to the King,
at present residing at the place called Cloux, near Amboise, and then
desires to be buried in the church of St.Florentine at Amboise, and
that his body should be accompanied from the said place of Cloux to
the said church, by the college of the said church, and the chaplains
of St.Dennis of Amboise, and the friars minor of the said place; and
that before his body is carried to the said church, it should remain
three days in the chamber in which he should die, or in some other; he
further orders that three great masses and thirty lesser masses of St.Gregory, should be celebrated there, and a like service be performed
in the church of St.Dennis, and in that of the said friars minor.He gives and bequeaths to Franco di Melzio, a gentleman of Milan, in
return for his services, all and every the books which he the testator
has at present, and other instruments and drawings respecting his art:
To Baptista de Villanis, his servant, the moiety of the garden which
he has without the walls of Milan; and the other moiety of the said
garden to Salay his servant.He gives to the said Francesco Meltio the
arrears of his pension, and the sum of money owing to him at present,
and at the time of his death, by the treasurer M. Johan Sapin; and to
the same person all and singular his clothes and vestments.He orders
and wills, that the sum of four hundred crowns of the sum which he has
in the hands of the chamberlain of Santa Maria Nuova, at Florence,
should be given to his brethren residing at Florence, with the profit
and emolument thereon.And lastly, he appoints the said Gia.Francesco
de Meltio, whole and sole executor[i72].This Will bears date, and appears to have been executed on the 23d of
April 1518.He however survived the making of it more than a year;
and on the 23d of April 1519[i73], the day twelvemonth on which it
had been originally made, he, though it does not appear for what
reason, re-executed it; and the next day added a codicil, by which he
gave to his servant, Gio.Battista de Villanis, the right which had
been granted him in return for his labours on the canal of Martesana,
of exacting a certain portion of all the wood transported on the
Ticino[i74].All this interval of time between the making and re-execution of his
will, and indeed the whole period from his arrival in France, he seems
to have been struggling under an incurable illness.The King frequently
during its continuance honoured him with visits; and it has been said,
that in one of these Leonardo exerting himself beyond his strength,
to shew his sense of this prince's condescension, was seized with
a fainting fit, and that the King stooping forward to support him,
Leonardo expired in his arms, on the 2d of May 1519[i75].Venturi has
taken some pains to disprove this fact, by shewing[i76], that though in
the interval between the years 1516 and 1519, the French court passed
eleven months at different times at Amboise; yet on the 1st of May
1519, it was certainly not here, but at St.History, however,
when incorrect, is more frequently a mixture of true and false, than
a total fabrication of falsehood; and it is therefore not impossible,
or improbable, that the King might shew such an act of kindness in
some of his visits when he was resident at Amboise, and that Leonardo
might recover from that fit, and not die till some time after; at which
latter time the Court and the King might be absent at St.This is surely a more rational supposition than to imagine such a fact
could have been invented without any foundation for it whatever.It is impossible within the limits that can here be allowed, to do any
thing like justice to the merits of this extraordinary man: all that
can in this place be effected is to give the principal facts respecting
him; and this is all, therefore, that has been attempted.A sufficient
account, however, at least for the present purpose, it is presumed has
been given above of the Author, and the productions of his pencil, and
it now remains therefore only to speak of those of his pen.With what view the Author engaged in this arduous course of study,
how eager he was in the pursuit of knowledge, how anxious to avail
himself of the best means of obtaining complete information on every
subject to which he applied, and how careful to minute down whatever he
procured that could be useful, have been already shewn in the course
of the foregoing narrative; but in order to prevent the necessity of
interrupting there the succession of events, it has been reserved for
this place to describe the contents and extent of his collections, and
to give a brief idea of the branches to which they relate.On inquiry then we learn, that Leonardo's productions of this kind
consist of fourteen manuscript volumes, large and small, now in the
library of the National Institute at Paris, whither they have been
some few years since removed from the Ambrosian library at Milan;
and of one folio volume in manuscript also, in the possession of his
Majesty the King of Great Britain.Of those at Paris, J. B. Venturi,
Professor of Natural Philosophy at Modena, and of the Institute of
Bologna, &c. who was permitted to inspect them, says[i77], that "they
contain speculations in those branches of natural philosophy nearest
allied to geometry; that they are first sketches and occasional notes,
the Author always intending afterwards to compose from them complete
treatises."He adds further, "that they are written backwards from
right to left, in the manner of the oriental writers, probably with
intention that the curious should not rob him of his discoveries.The spirit of geometry guided him throughout, whether it were in the
art of analysing a subject in the connexion of the discourse, or the
care of always generalizing his ideas.As to natural philosophy, he
never was satisfied on any proposition if he had not proved it by
experiment."From the extracts given from these manuscripts by Venturi
himself, and which he has ranged under the different heads mentioned
in the note[i78], the contents of these volumes appear to be extremely
miscellaneous; and it is evident, as Venturi has marked by references
where each extract is to be found in the original, that from the great
distance at which passages on the same subject are placed from each
other, they must have been entered without any regard to method or
arrangement of any kind whatever.The volume in the possession of his Britannic Majesty is described as
consisting "of a variety of elegant heads, some of which are drawn
with red and black chalks on blue or red paper, others with a metal
pencil on a tinted paper; a few of them are washed and heightened with
white, and many are on common paper.The subjects of these drawings
are miscellaneous, as portraits, caricatures, single figures, tilting,
horses, and other animals; botany, optics, perspective, gunnery,
hydraulics, mechanics, and a great number of anatomical subjects, which
are drawn with a more spirited pen, and illustrated with a variety of
manuscript notes.This volume contains what is of more importance, the
very characteristic head of Leonardo, as it was sketched by himself,
and now engraved by that eminent artist Mr.Specimens
from this volume have been published some years since by Mr.Dalton,
and more recently and accurately by Mr.Chamberlaine; and though it
must be confessed, that the former are extremely ill drawn, and betray
the grossest ignorance of the effect which light and shadow were
intended to produce, yet some of the subjects which the volume contains
may be ascertained by them; and among them is also a fac simile of a
page of the original manuscript, which proves this, like the other
volumes, to be in Italian, and written backwards.The latter is a
very beautiful work, and is calculated to give an accurate idea of
Leonardo's talents as a draughtsman[i80].From these two publications
it appears, that this volume also is of a very miscellaneous nature,
and that it consists of manuscript entries, interspersed with finished
drawings of heads and figures, and slight sketches of mechanical
engines and anatomical subjects, some of which are intermixed with the
writing itself.It has been already seen, that these volumes were originally given by
the will of Leonardo to Francisco Melzi; and their subsequent history
we are enabled to state on the authority of John Ambrose Mazenta,
through whose hands they passed.Du Fresne, in the life prefixed to
the edition which he published in Italian, of Leonardo da Vinci's
Treatise on Painting, has, in a very loose way, and without citing
any authority, given their history; but Venturi has inserted[i81]
a translation into French, from the original manuscript memoir of
Mazenta; and from him a version of it into English is here given, with
the addition of Venturi's notes, rendered also into English."It is near fifty years[i82] since there fell into my hands thirteen
volumes of Leonardo da Vinci in folio and quarto, written backwards.Accident brought them to me in the following manner: I was residing
at Pisa, for the purpose of studying the law, in the family of Aldus
Manutius the younger, a great lover of books.A person named Lelio
Gavardi, of Asola, Prevost of S. Zeno, at Pavia, a very near relation
of Aldus, came to our house; he had been a teacher of the _belles
lettres_ in the family of the Melzi of Milan, called de Vavero, to
distinguish them from other families of the same name in that city.He had, at their country house at Vavero, met with several drawings,
instruments, and books of Leonardo.Francisco Melzi[i83] approached
nearer than any one to the manner of De Vinci; he worked little,
because he was rich; his pictures are very much finished, they are
often confounded with those of his master.At his death he left the
works of Leonardo in his house at Vavero, to his sons, who having
tastes and pursuits of a different kind, neglected these treasures,
and soon dispersed them; Lelio Gavardi possessed himself of as many of
them as he pleased; he carried thirteen volumes to Florence, in hopes
of receiving for them a good price from the Grand Duke Francis, who
was eager after works of this sort; and the rather as Leonardo was in
great reputation in his own country.But this prince died[i84] as soon
as Gavardi was arrived at Florence.He then went to Pisa, to the house
of Manutius.I could not approve his proceeding; it was scandalous.My studies being finished, I had occasion to return to Milan.He gave
me the volumes of Vinci, desiring me to return them to the Melzi: I
acquitted myself faithfully of my commission; I carried them all back
to Horatio, the chief of the family of Melzi, who was surprised at
my being willing to give myself this trouble.He made me a present
of these books, telling me he had still many drawings by the same
author, long neglected in the garrets of his house in the country.Thus these books became my property, and afterwards they belonged to
my brothers[i85].These latter having made too much parade of this
acquisition, and the ease with which I was brought to it, excited the
envy of other amateurs, who beset Horatio, and obtained from him some
drawings, some figures, some anatomical pieces, and other valuable
remains of the cabinet of Leonardo.One of these spungers for the works
of Leonardo, was Pompeo Aretin, son of the Cavalier Leoni, formerly a
disciple of Bonaroti, and who was about Philip II.King of Spain, for
whom he did all the bronzes which are at the Escurial.Pompeo engaged
himself to procure for Melzi an employment to the senate of Milan,
if he succeeded in recovering the thirteen books, wishing to offer
them to King Philip, a lover of such curiosities.Flattered with this
hope, Melzi went to my brother's house: he besought him on his knees
to restore him his present; he was a fellow-collegian, a friend, a
benefactor: seven volumes were returned to him[i86].Of the six others
which remained to the Mazenta family, one was presented to Cardinal
Frederic Borromeo, for the Ambrosian library[i87].My brother gave a
second to Ambrose Figini, a celebrated painter of his time, who left
it to his heir Hercole Bianchi, with the rest of his cabinet.Urged by
the Duke of Savoy, I procured for him a third; and in conclusion, my
brother having died at a distance from Milan[i88], the three remaining
volumes came also into the hands of Pompeo Aretin; he re-assembled
also others of them, he separated the leaves of them to form a thick
volume[i89], which passed to his heir Polidoro Calchi, and was
afterwards sold to Galeazzo Arconati.This gentleman keeps it now in
his rich library; he has refused it to the Duke of Savoy, and to other
princes who were desirous of it."In addition to this memoir, Venturi notices[i90], that Howard Earl
of Arundel made ineffectual efforts to obtain this large volume,
and offered for it as far as 60,000 francs, in the name of the King
of England.Arconati would never part with it; he bought eleven
other books of Da Vinci, which came also, according to appearance,
from Leoni; in 1637 he made a gift of them all to the Ambrosian
library[i91], which already was in possession of the volume E, from
Mazenta, and received afterwards the volume K from Horatio Archinto, in
1674[i92].Venturi says, this is the history of all the manuscripts of Vinci that
are come into France; they are in number fourteen, because the volume
B contains an appendix of eighteen leaves, which may be separated, and
considered as the fourteenth volume[i93].In the printed catalogue of the library of Turin, one does not see
noticed the manuscript which Mazenta gave to the Duke of Savoy: it has
then disappeared.Might it not be that which an Englishman got copied
by Francis Ducci, library-keeper at Florence, and a copy of which is
still remaining in the same city[i94]?The Trivulce family at Milan, according to Venturi[i95], possess also a
manuscript of Vinci, which is in great part only a vocabulary.Of the volume in the possession of his Britannic Majesty, the following
account is given in the life of Leonardo, prefixed to that number
already published from it by Mr.Chamberlaine: "It was one of the three
volumes which became the property of Pompeo Leoni, that is now in his
Majesty's cabinet.It is rather probable than certain, that this great
curiosity was acquired for King Charles I. by the Earl of Arundel, when
he went Ambassador to the Emperor Ferdinand II.in 1636, as may indeed
be inferred from an instructive inscription over the place where the
volumes are kept, which sets forth, that James King of England offered
three thousand pistoles for one of the volumes of Leonardo's works.And
some documents in the Ambrosian library give colour to this conjecture.This volume was happily preserved during the civil wars of the last
century among other specimens of the fine arts, which the munificence
of Charles I. had amassed with a diligence equal to his taste.And it
was discovered soon after his present Majesty's accession in the same
cabinet where Queen Caroline found the fine portraits of the court of
Henry VIII.by Hans Holbein, which the King's liberality permitted
me lately to lay before the public.On the cover of this volume is
written, in gold letters, what ascertains its descent; _Disegni di
Leonardo da Vinci, restaurati da Pompeo Leoni_."Although no part of the collections of Leonardo was arranged and
prepared by himself, or others under his direction, for publication,
some extracts have been made from his writings, and given to the world
as separate tracts.The best known, and indeed the principal of these,
is the following Treatise on Painting, of which there will be occasion
to say more presently; but besides this, Edward Cooper, a London
bookseller, about the year 1720, published a fragment of a Treatise by
Leonardo da Vinci, on the Motions of the Human Body, and the Manner of
drawing Figures, according to geometrical Rules.It contains but ten
plates in folio, including the title-page, and was evidently extracted
from some of the volumes of his collections, as it consists of slight
sketches and verbal descriptions both in Italian and English, to
explain such of them as needed it.Dalton, as has been before noticed, several years since published
some engravings from the volume in our King's collection, but they are
so badly done as to be of no value.Chamberlaine therefore, in
1796, took up the intention afresh, and in that year his first number
came out, which is all that has yet appeared.Of the Treatise on Painting, Venturi[i96] gives the following
particulars: "The Treatise on Painting which we have of Vinci is only
a compilation of different fragments extracted from his manuscripts.It was in the Barberini library at Rome, in 1630[i97]: the Cav.del
Pozzo obtained a copy from it, and Poussin designed the figures of it
in 1640[i98].This copy, and another derived from the same source,
in the possession of Thevenot, served as the basis for the edition
published in 1651, by Raphael du Frene.The manuscript of Pozzo,
with the figures of Poussin, is actually at Paris, in the valuable
collection of books of Chardin[i99].It is from this that I have taken
the relation of Mazenta; it is at the end of the manuscript under this
title: "Some Notices of the Works of Leonardo da Vinci at Milan, and
of his Books, by J. Ambrose Mazenta of Milan, of the Congregation of
the Priests Regular of St.Mazenta does
not announce himself as the author of the compilation; he may however
be so; it may also happen, that the compilation was made by the heir
himself of Vinci, Francisco Melzo.Vasari, about 1567, says[i100], that
a painter of Milan had the manuscripts of Vinci, which were written
backwards; that this painter came to him, and afterwards went to Rome,
with intention to get them printed, but that he did not know what was
the result.However it may be, Du Frene confesses that this compilation
is imperfect in many respects, and ill arranged.It is so, because the
compiler has not seized the methodical spirit of Vinci, and that there
are mixed with it some pieces which belong to other tracts; besides,
one has not seen where many other chapters have been neglected which
ought to make part of it.For example, the comparison of painting with
sculpture, which has been announced as a separate treatise of the same
author, is nothing more than a chapter belonging to the Treatise on
Painting, A.All this will be complete, and put in order, in the
Treatise on Optics[i101].In the mean time, however, the following are
the different editions of this compilation, such as it is at present:

"Trattato della Pittura di Leonardo da Vinci, nuovamente dato in Luce,
con la Vita dell' Autore da Raphaele du Frene, Parigi 1651, in fol.;
reprinted at Naples in 1733, in folio; at Bologna, in 1786, in folio;
at Florence, in 1792, in 4to.This last edition has been given from a
copy in the hand-writing of Stephano della Bella.

"----Translated into French by Roland Freart de Chambray, Paris 1651,
fol.1716, in 12mo, and 1796, in 8vo.

"----Translated into German, in 4to.Nuremberg 1786, Weigel.

"----Translated into Greek by Panagiotto, manuscript in the Nani
library at Venice."Another manuscript copy of this compilation was in the possession of
P. Orlandi, from whence it passed into the library of Smith[i102]."Cellini, in a discourse published by Morelli, says[i103], that he
possessed a copy of a book of De Vinci on Perspective, which he
communicated to Serlio, and that this latter published from it all that
he could comprehend.Might not this be the tract which Gori announces
to be in the library of the Academy of Cortona[i104]?"The reputation in which the Treatise on Painting ought to be held,
is not now for the first time to be settled; its merit has been
acknowledged by the best judges, though at that time it laboured under
great disadvantage from the want of a proper arrangement.In the
present publication that objection is removed, and the attempt has
been favourable to the work itself, as it has shewn it, by bringing
together the several chapters that related to each other, to be a
much more complete and connected treatise than was before supposed.Notwithstanding however the fair estimation in which it has always
stood, and which is no more than its due, one person has been found
hardy enough to endeavour, though unsuccessfully, to lessen its credit:
a circumstance which it would not have been worth while to notice, if
it had not been intimated to us, that there are still some persons
in France who side with the objector, which, as he was a Frenchman,
and Leonardo an Italian, may perhaps be ascribed, in some measure at
least, to the desire which in several instances that people have lately
shewn of claiming on behalf of their countrymen, a preference over
others, to which they are not entitled.Abraham Bosse, of the city of
Tours, an engraver in copper, who lived in the last century, is the
person here alluded to; and it may not be impertinent in this place to
state some of the motives by which he was induced to such a conduct.At the time when this Treatise first made its appearance in France,
as well in Italian as in French, Bosse appears to have been resident
at Paris, and was a member of the Academy of Painting, where he gave
the first lessons on perspective, and, with the assistance of Mons.Desargues, published from time to time several tracts on geometry and
perspective, the manner of designing, and the art of engraving, some
of which at least are described in the title-page, as printed at Paris
for the author[i105].This man, in his lectures, having, it is said,
attacked some of the pictures painted by Le Brun, the then Director of
the Academy, had been very deservedly removed from his situation, and
forced to quit the Academy, for endeavouring to lessen that authority,
which for the instruction and improvement of students it was necessary
the Director should possess, and attempting thus to render fruitless
the precepts which his situation required him to deliver.As this
Treatise of Leonardo had in the translation been adopted by Le Brun,
who fully saw its value, and introduced it into the Academy for the
advantage of the students, by which means the sale of Bosse's work
might be, and probably was, affected; Bosse, at the end of a Treatise
on Geometry and Perspective, taught in the Royal Academy of Painting
and Sculpture, published by him in octavo in 1665, has inserted a paper
with this title, which in the original is given in French, but we have
preferred translating it: "_What follows is for those who shall have
the curiosity to be acquainted with a part of the procedings of Mons.Desargues, and myself, against some of our antagonists, and part of
their skill; together with some remarks made on the contents of several
chapters of a Treatise attributed to Leonardo de Vinci, translated
from Italian into French by Mons.Freart Sieur de Chambray, from a
manuscript taken from that which is in the library of the illustrious,
virtuous, and curious Mons.le Chevalier Du Puis at Rome_."After the explanation of his motives above given, it is not wonderful
to find him asserting, that this Treatise of Leonardo was in a number
of circumstances inferior to his own; nor to observe, that in a list of
some of the chapters which he has there given, we should be frequently
told by him that they are false, absurd, ridiculous, confused,
trifling, weak, and, in short, every thing but good.It is true that
the estimation of Leonardo da Vinci was in France too high for him to
attack without risking his own character for judgment and taste, and he
has therefore found it necessary for his purpose insidiously to suggest
that these chapters were interpolations; but of this he has produced no
proof, which, had it been the fact, might have been easily obtained, by
only getting some friend to consult Leonardo's manuscript collections
in the Ambrosian library.That he would have taken this step if he
had expected any success from it, may fairly be inferred from the
circumstance of his writing to Poussin at Rome, apparently in hopes of
inducing him to say something to the disadvantage of the work; and his
omitting to make this inquiry after the enmity he has shewn against the
book, fully justifies an opinion that he forbore to inquire, because
he was conscious that such an investigation would have terminated in
vindicating his adversaries from his aspersions, and have furnished
evidence of their fidelity and accuracy.What the letter which he wrote to Poussin contained, he has not
informed us; but he has given us, as he says, Poussin's answer[i106],
in which are some passages relating to this Treatise, of which we here
give a translation: "As to what concerns the book of Leonard Vinci, it
is true that I have designed the human figures which are in that which
Mons.le Chevalier du Puis has; but all the others, whether geometrical
or otherwise, are of one man, named Gli Alberti, the very same who has
drawn the plants which are in the book of subterraneous Rome; and the
awkward landscapes which are behind some of the little human figures of
the copy which Mons.du Chambray has caused to be printed, have been
added to it by one Errard, without my knowing any thing of it."All that is good in this book may be written on one sheet of paper, in
a large character, and those who believe that I approve all that is in
it, do not know me; I who profess never to give sanction to things of
my profession which I know to be ill done and ill said."Whoever recollects the difference in the course of study pursued and
recommended by Leonardo (that of Nature), from that observed by Poussin
(that of the antique), and remembers also the different fortunes of
Le Brun and Poussin, that the one was at the head of his profession,
enjoying all its honours and emoluments, while the other, though
conscious of his own great powers, was toiling for a daily subsistence
in comparative obscurity, may easily conceive why the latter could not
approve a work which so strongly inculcates the adopting Nature as the
guide throughout; and which was at the same time patronized by one whom
he could not but consider as his more fortunate rival.It may however
be truly affirmed, that even the talents of Poussin, great as they
certainly were, and his knowledge and correctness in drawing, would
have been abundantly improved by an attention to the rules laid down
in this Treatise, and that the study of Nature would have freed his
pictures from that resemblance to statues which his figures frequently
have, and bestowed on them the soft and fleshy appearance for which
Leonardo was so remarkable; while a minute investigation of Leonardo's
system of colouring would have produced perhaps in him as fortunate a
change as we have seen it did in the case of Raphael.Though Bosse tells us[i107], that he had seen in the hands of Mons.Felibien, a manuscript copy of this Tract on Painting, which he said
he had taken from the same original mentioned before, for the purpose
of translating it into French; and that on Bosse's pointing out to
him some of these errors, and informing him that Mons.de Chambray
was far advanced in his translation, he abandoned his design, and
assigned to the Sieur de Chambray the privilege he had obtained for it;
we have no intention here to enumerate or answer Bosse's objections,
merely because such an undertaking would greatly exceed the limits
which can here be allowed us.Most of them will be found captious
and splenetic, and, together with the majority of the rest, might be
fully refuted by a deduction of facts; it is however sufficient on the
present occasion to say, that wherever opportunity has been afforded
of tracing the means by which Leonardo procured his materials for any
great composition, he is found to have exactly pursued the path which
he recommends to others[i108]; and for the success of his precepts, and
what may be effected by them, we need only appeal to his own example.To this enumeration of the productions of Leonardo's pen, and in
contradiction to the fact already asserted, that no part of his
collections was ever arranged or prepared for publication by himself,
it is probable we may be told we should add tracts on Motion; on the
Equilibrium of bodies; on the nature, equilibrium, and motion of Water;
on Anatomy; on the Anatomy of an horse; on Perspective; and on Light
and Shadow: which are either mentioned by himself in the Treatise on
Painting, or ascribed to him by others.But as to these, there is great
reason for supposing, that, though they might be intended, they were
never actually drawn up into form.Certain it is, that no such have
been ever given to the world, as those before noticed are the only
treatises of this author that have yet appeared in print; and even they
have already been shewn to be no more than extracts from the immense
mass of his collections of such passages as related to the subjects on
which they profess to give intelligence.If any tracts therefore in his
name, on any of the above topics, are any where existing in manuscript,
and in obscurity, it is probable they are only similar selections.And
indeed it will be found on inspection, that his collections consist
of a multitude of entries made at different times, without method,
order, or arrangement of any kind, so as to form an immense chaos of
intelligence, which he, like many other voluminous collectors, intended
at some future time to digest and arrange, but unfortunately postponed
this task so long, that he did not live to carry that intention into
effect.Under these circumstances, should it happen, as perhaps it
may, that any volume of the whole is confined exclusively to any one
branch of science, such as hydrostatics for instance, it was not the
consequence of a designed plan, but only arose from this accident, that
he had then made that branch the object of his pursuit, and for a time
laid aside the rest.In proof of this assertion it may be observed,
that the very treatise of light and shadow above mentioned, is
described as in the Ambrosian library at Milan, and as a folio volume
covered with red velvet, presented by Signior Mazzenta to Cardinal
Borromeo[i109]; from all which circumstances it is evidently proved
to be one of the volumes now existing in France[i110], which were
inspected and described by Venturi in the tract so often cited in the
course of this life.Although the principal of Leonardo's productions have been already
mentioned, it has been thought proper, for the satisfaction of the
curious, here to subjoin a catalogue of such of them as have come to
our knowledge; distinguishing in it such as were only drawings, from
such as were finished pictures, and noticing also which of them have
been engraven, and by whom.CATALOGUE

                                OF THE

                                 WORKS

                                  OF

                         _LEONARDO DA VINCI_.Many _designs for plans and buildings_, made by him in his youth[i111]._A model_ made by him for raising the roof of the church of St._The house of the family of Melzi at Vaprio_, supposed by Della Valle
to be designed by Leonardo[i113].MODELS /and/ SCULPTURE.Some _heads of laughing women_, modelled by him in clay, in his
youth[i114].Some _boys' heads_ also, which appeared to have come from the hand of a
master[i115]._Three figures in bronze_, over the gate on the north side of the
church of St.John, at Florence, made by Gio.Francesco Rustici, but
designed with the advice of Leonardo da Vinci[i116]._A model in clay_, in alto relievo.It is a circle of about two palms
in diameter, and represents St.Jerom in a grotto, old, and much worn
out by prayer.Ignazio Hugford, a
painter at Florence, who was induced to buy it in consequence of the
great praises which in his youth he had heard bestowed on it by the
celebrated Anton.Dominico Gabbiani, his master, who knew it to be of
the hand of Leonardo.This model appears to have been much studied in
the time of Pontormo and Rosso; and many copies of it, both drawings
and pictures, are to be found throughout Florence, well painted in
their manner[i117].The _equestrian statue_ in memory of the Duke of Milan's father, which
was not only finished and exposed to view, but broken to pieces by the
French when they took possession of Milan.It has been said by some,
that the model only was finished, and the statue never cast, and that
it was the model only which the French destroyed[i118].36, mentions a little _model_ by Leonardo in wax, but he
does not say what was its subject.24, says, that it was Leonardo's practice to model figures
from the life, and then to cover them with fine thin lawn or cambric,
so as to be able to see through it, and with the point of a fine pencil
to trace off the outlines in black and white; and that some such
drawings he had in his collection._A head in chiaro oscuro_, in the possession of Vasari, and mentioned
by him as divine, a drawing on paper[i119]._A carton of Adam and Eve in Paradise_, made by him for the King of
Portugal.It is done with a pen in chiaro oscuro, and heightened with
white, and was intended to be worked as tapestry in silk and gold; but
Vasari says it was never executed, and that in his time the carton
remained at Florence, in the house of Ottaviano de Medici.Whether this
carton is still existing is unknown[i120]._Several ridiculous heads of men and women_, formerly in Vasari's
collection, drawn in pen and ink[i121].Aurelio Lovino had, says
Lomazzo, a book of sketches by Leonardo, of odd and ridiculous heads.This book appears to have contained about 250 figures of countrymen
and countrywomen laughing, drawn by the hand of Leonardo.Silvio
Valenti had a similar book, in which were caricature heads drawn with a
pen, like that engraven by Count Caylus.Of these caricatures mention
is made in the second volume of the Lettere Pittoriche, p.The passage in the Lettere Pittoriche here referred to, is part of a
letter without any name or date, addressed _Al Sig.C. di C._; but a
note of the editor's explains these initials, as meaning Sig.Conte
di Caylus, and supposes the author to have been the younger Mariette.The letter mentions a collection of heads from Leonardo's drawings,
published by the Count; and the editor, in another note, tells us, that
they are caricature heads drawn in pen and ink; that the originals
were bought in Holland, from Sig.Silvio Valenti, and that the
prints of which the letter speaks, are in the famous collection of the
Corsini library.The author of the Letter supposes these caricatures to
have been drawn when Vinci retired to Melzi's house, that he invented
them as a new sort of recreation, and intended them as a subject for
the academy which he had established at Milan.In another part of the same Letter, p.173, 174, this collection of
drawings of heads is again mentioned, and it is there said, that it
might be that which belonged to the Earl of Arundel.This conjecture
is founded on there being many such heads engraven formerly by Hollar.In fact, the number of the plates which he has done from drawings of
this painter, are near one hundred, which compose different series.The
author of the Letter adds, that, if a conjecture might be permitted,
we might affirm, that this is the collection of heads of which Paul
Lomazzo speaks; at least the description which he gives of a similar
collection which was in the hands of Aurelio Lovino, a painter of
Milan, corresponds with this as well in the number of the drawings
as their subjects.It represents, like this, studies from old men,
countrymen, wrinkled old women, which are all laughing.Another part of
this Letter says, it is easy to believe that the collection of drawings
of heads which occasioned this Letter, might be one of those books in
which Leonardo noted the most singular countenances.198 of the same Letter, Hollar's engravings are said to be about
an hundred, and to have been done at Antwerp in 1645, and the following
year; and in p.199, Count Caylus's publication is said to contain 59
plates in aqua fortis, done in 1730, and that this latter is the work
so often mentioned in the Letter._Another collection of the same kind of caricature heads_ mentioned in
Mariette's Letter[i123], as existing in the cabinet of either the King
of Spain or the King of Sardinia._Four caricature heads_, mentioned, Lett.190,
as being in the possession of Sig.They are described as
drawn with a pen, and are said to have come originally from Vasari's
collection of drawings.Of this collection it is said, in a note on the
above passage, that it was afterwards carried into France, and fell
into the hands of a bookseller, who took the volume to pieces, and
disposed of the drawings separately, and that many of them came into
the cabinets of the King, and Sig.Others say, and it is more
credible, that Vasari's collection passed into that of the Grand Dukes
of Medici._A head of Americo Vespucci_, in charcoal, but copied by Vasari in pen
and ink[i124]._A head of an old man_, beautifully drawn in charcoal[i125]._An head of Scarramuccia, captain of the gypsies_, in chalk; formerly
belonging to Pierfrancesco Giambullari, canon of St.Lorenzo, at
Florence, and left by him to Donato Valdambrini of Arezzo, canon of St._Several designs of combatants on horseback_, made by Leonardo for
Gentil Borri, a master of defence[i127], to shew the different
positions necessary for a horse soldier in defending himself, and
attacking his enemy._A carton of our Saviour, the Virgin, St.John._ Vasari
says of this, that for two days, people of all sorts, men and women,
young and old, resorted to Leonardo's house to see this wonderful
performance, as if they had been going to a solemn feast; and adds,
that this carton was afterwards in France.It seems that this was
intended for an altar-piece for the high altar of the church of the
Annunziata, but the picture was never painted[i128].However, when
Leonardo afterwards went into France, he, at the desire of Francis
the First, put the design into colours.Lomazzo has said, that this
carton of St.Ann was carried into France; that in his time it was at
Milan, in the possession of Aurelio Lovino, a painter; and that many
drawings from it were in existence.What was the fate this carton of
St.Ann underwent, may be seen in a letter of P. Resta, printed in the
third volume of the Lettere Pittoriche, in which he says, that Leonardo
made three of these cartons, and nevertheless did not convert it into
a picture, but that it was painted by Salai, and that the picture is
still in the sacristy of St._A drawing of an old man's head, seen in front_, in red chalk;
mentioned Lett._A carton_ designed by him _for painting the council-chamber at
Florence_.The subject which he chose for this purpose was, the history
of Niccolo Piccinino, the Captain of Duke Philip of Milan, in which
he drew a group of men on horseback fighting for a standard[i130].Mariette, in a note, Lett.193, mentions this carton,
which he says represented two horsemen fighting for a standard; that
it was only part of a large history, the subject of which was the rout
of Niccolo Piccinino, General of the army of Philip Duke of Milan,
and that a print was engraven of it by Edelinck, when young, but the
drawing from which he worked was a bad one.In the catalogue of prints
from the works of Leonardo, inserted Lett.195, this
print is again mentioned and described more truly, as representing
four horsemen fighting for a standard.It is there supposed to have
been engraven from a drawing by Fiammingo, and that this drawing might
have been made from the picture which Du Fresne speaks of as being in
his time in the possession of Sig.La Maire, an excellent painter of
perspective._A design of Neptune drawn in his car by sea horses, attended by sea
gods_; made by him for his friend Antonio Segni[i131]._Several anatomical drawings_ made from the life, many of which
have been since collected into a volume, by his scholar Francesco
Melzi[i132]._A book of the Anatomy of man_, mentioned by Vasari, p.36, the
drawings for which were made with the assistance of Marc Antonio della
Torre, before noticed in the present life.It is probably the same with
the preceding.A beautiful and well-preserved study in red and black chalk, of the
_head of a Virgin_, from which he afterwards painted a picture.This
study was at one time in the celebrated Villa de Vecchietti, but
afterwards, in consequence of a sale, passed into the hands of Sig._Two heads of women in profile_, little differing from each other,
drawn in like manner in black and red chalk, bought at the same sale
by Sig.Hugford, but now among the Elector Palatine's collection of
drawings[i134]._A book of the Anatomy of a horse_, mentioned by Vasari, p.36, as
a distinct work; but probably included in Leonardo's manuscript
collections.Several designs by Leonardo were in the possession of Sig.Jabac, who
seems to have been a collector of pictures, and to have bought up for
the King of France several excellent pictures particularly by Leonardo
da Vinci[i135]._A drawing of a young man embracing an old woman_, whom he is caressing
for the sake of her riches.198, as engraven by Hollar, in 1646._A head of a young man seen in profile_, engraven in aqua fortis
by Conte di Caylus, from a drawing in the King of France's
collection[i136]._A fragment of a Treatise on the Motions of the Human Body_, already
mentioned in the foregoing life.In the Lettere Pittoriche, vol.199, mention is made of a print
representing _some intertwisted lines upon a black ground_, in the
style of some of Albert Durer's engravings in wood.In the middle of
this, in a small compartment, is to be read, "/Academia Leonardi Vin/."Vasari, it is there said, has noticed it as a singularity.200 of the same work, a similar print is also noticed, which
differs only in the inscription from the former.In this last it is
/Academia Leonardi Vici/.Both this and the former print are said to
be extremely rare, and only to have been seen in the King of France's
collection.It does not however appear from any thing in the Lett.The Abate di Villeloin, in his Catalogue of Prints published in 1666,
speaks, under the article of Leonardo da Vinci, of a print of the
taking down from the Cross; but the Lett.says it was engraven
from Eneas Vico, not from Leonardo[i137]._Two drawings of monsters_, mentioned by Lomazzo, consisting of a boy's
head each, but horribly distorted by the misplacing of the features,
and the introduction of other members not in Nature to be found
there.These two drawings were in the hands of Francesco Borella, a
sculptor[i138]._A portrait_ by Leonardo, _of Artus, Maestro di Camera to Francis I._
drawn in black lead pencil[i139]._The head of a Caesar crowned with oak_, among a valuable collection
of drawings in a thick volume in folio, in the possession of Sig._The proportions of the human body._ The original of this is preserved
in the possession of Sig.At the head and foot of this drawing
is to be read the description which begins thus: _Tanto apre l'Uomo
nelle braccia quanto e la sua altezza, &c._ and above all, at the
head of the work is the famous Last Supper, which he proposes to his
scholars as the rule of the art[i141]._The Circumcision_, a large drawing mentioned Lett.283, as the work of Leonardo, by Nicolo Gabburri, in a letter dated
Florence, 4th Oct.Gabburri says he saw this drawing, and that it was done on white paper
a little tinted with Indian ink, and heightened with ceruse.Its owner
then was Alessandro Galilei, an architect of Florence._A drawing consisting of several laughing heads, in the middle of which
is another head in profile, crowned with oak leaves._ This drawing was
the property of the Earl of Arundel, and was engraven by Hollar in
1646[i142]._A man sitting, and collecting in a looking-glass the rays of the sun,
to dazzle the eyes of a dragon who is fighting with a lion._ A print of
this is spoken of, Lett.197, as badly engraven by an
anonymous artist, but it is there said to have so little of Leonardo's
manner as to afford reason for believing it not designed by him, though
it might perhaps be found among his drawings in the King of France's
collection.Another print of it, of the same size, has been engraven
from the drawing by Conte de Caylus.It represents a pensive man, and
differs from the former in this respect, that in this the man is naked,
whereas in the drawing he is clothed._A Madonna_, formerly in the possession of Pope Clement the
Seventh[i143]._A small Madonna and Child_, painted for Baldassar Turini da Pescia,
who was the Datary[i144] at Lyons, the colours of which are much
faded[i145]._A Virgin and Child_, at one time in the hands of the Botti
family[i146].Ann's lap, and holding her little Son_,
formerly at Paris[i147].This has been engraven in wood, in chiaro
oscuro, by an unknown artist.The picture was in the King of France's
cabinet, and a similar one is in the sacristy of St.Celsus at
Milan[i148].John, and an Angel_, mentioned by Du
Fresne, as at Paris[i149]._A Madonna and Child_, in the possession of the Marquis di Surdi[i150]._A Madonna and Child_, painted on the wall in the church of St.Onofrio
at Rome[i151]._A Madonna kneeling_, in the King's gallery in France[i152].Michael, and another Angel_, in the King of
France's collection[i153]._A Madonna_, in the church of St.Francis at Milan, attributed to
Leonardo by Sorman[i154]._A Virgin and Child_, by Leonardo, in Piacenza, near the church of Our
Lady in the Fields.It was bought for 300 chequins by the Principe di
Belgioioso[i155]._A Madonna, half length, holding on her knee the infant Jesus, with a
lily in his hand._ A print of this, engraven in aqua fortis by Giuseppe
Juster, is mentioned Lett.The picture is there
said to have been in the possession of Charles Patin, and was supposed
by some to have been painted for Francis I._An Herodiade_, some time in Cardinal Richelieu's possession[i156]._The daughter of Herodias, with an executioner holding out to her the
head of St.John_, in the Barberini palace[i157]._An Herodiade with a basket, in which is the head of John the Baptist._
A print of this in aqua fortis, by Gio.Troven, under the direction of
Teniers, is mentioned Lett.197, and is there said
to have been done from a picture which was then in the cabinet of the
Archduke Leopold, but had been before in that of the Emperor.Another picture of the same subject, but differently disposed.A print from it, in aqua fortis, by Alessio Loyr,
is mentioned Lett.197; but it is not there said in
whose possession the picture ever was._The angel_ in Verrochio's picture before mentioned[i158]._The shield_, mentioned by Vasari, p.26, as painted by him at the
request of his father, and consisting of serpents, &c._A head of Medusa_, in oil, in the palace of Duke Cosmo.It is still in
being, and in good preservation[i159]._A head of an angel raising one arm in the air_, in the collection
of Duke Cosmo[i160].Whether this is a picture, or only a drawing,
does not appear; but as Vasari does not notice any difference between
that and the head of Medusa, which he decidedly says is in oil, it is
probable that this is so also._The Adoration of the Magi_: it was in the house of Americo Benci,
opposite to the Portico of Peruzzi[i161]._The famous Last Supper_, in the Refectory of the Dominican convent of
Santa Maria delle Grazie[i162].A list of the copies made from this
celebrated picture has, together with its history, been given in a
former page.A print has been engraven from it under the direction of
Pietro Soutman; but he being a scholar of Rubens, has introduced into
it so much of Rubens's manner[i163], that it can no longer be known for
Leonardo da Vinci's.Besides this, Mariette also mentions two other
prints, one of them an engraving, the other an etching, but both by
unknown authors.He notices also, that the Count di Caylus had etched
it in aqua fortis[i164].The print lately engraven of it by Morghen has
been already noticed in a former page._A Nativity_, sent as a present from the Duke of Milan to the
Emperor[i165]._The portraits of Lodovic Sforza, Duke of Milan, and Maximilian his
eldest son, and on the other side Beatrix his dutchess, and Francesco
his other son_, all in one picture, in the same Refectory with the Last
Supper[i166]._The portraits of two of the handsomest women at Florence_, painted by
him as a present to Lewis XII[i167]._The painting in the council-chamber at Florence_[i168].The subject of
this is the battle of Attila[i169]._A portrait of Ginevra_, daughter of Americo Benci[i170]._The portrait of Mona Lisa_, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo,
painted for her husband[i171].Lomazzo has said, she was a Neapolitan,
but this is supposed a mistake, and that she was a Florentine[i172].In
a note of Mariette's, Lett.175, this picture is said
to have been in the collection of Francis I. King of France, who gave
for it 4000 crowns._A small picture of a child_, which was at Pescia, in the possession of
Baldassar Turini.It is not known where this now is[i173]._A painting of two horsemen struggling for a flag_, in the Palais Royal
at Paris[i174]._A nobleman of Mantua_[i175]._A picture of Flora_, which Du Fresne mentions as being in his time
at Paris.This is said to have been once in the cabinet of Mary de
Medicis[i176], and though for some time supposed to have been painted
by Leonardo da Vinci, was discovered by Mariette to have been the work
of Francisco Melzi, whose name is upon it[i177].In the supplement to
the life of Leonardo, inserted in Della Valle's edition of Vasari, this
picture is said to have been painted for the Duke de S. Simone._A head of John the Baptist_, in the hands of Camillo Albizzo[i178]._The Conception of the blessed Virgin_, for the church of St.This was esteemed a copy, and not worth more than 30
chequins, till an Englishman came there, who thought a large sum of
money well employed in the purchase of it[i180].John in the Wilderness_, said to be at Paris[i181].197, mention is made of a print of St.John the Baptist,
half length, by Sig.Jabac, who had the original picture, which was
formerly in the King of France's cabinet._Joseph and Potiphar's wife_, which Mons.de Charmois, secretary to the
Duke of Schomberg, had[i182]._A portrait of Raphael_, in oil, in the Medici gallery.This is
mentioned in Vasari, p.47; and though not expressly there said to be
by Leonardo, is so placed as to make it doubtful whether it was or not._A Nun, half length_, by Leonardo, in the possession of Abbate
Nicolini[i183]._Two fine heads_, painted in oil by Leonardo, bought at Florence by
Sig.Bali di Breteuil, ambassador from Malta to Rome.One of these,
representing a woman, was in his first manner.The other, a Virgin, in
his last[i184]._A Leda_, which Lomazzo says was at Fontainebleau, and did not yield in
colouring to the portrait of Joconda in the Duke's gallery.Richardson
says it was in the palace Mattei[i185]._The head of a dead man_, with all its minute parts, painted by
Leonardo, formerly in the Mattei palace, but no longer there[i186].A picture containing a study of _two most delicate female heads_, in
the Barberini palace at Rome[i187]._A portrait of a girl with a book in her hand_, in the Strozzi palace
in Rome[i188]._The Dispute of Jesus with the Doctors_, half length, in the Panfili
palace[i189].Five pictures in the Ambrosian library at Milan, the subjects not
mentioned[i190].Some in the gallery of the archbishopric at Milan, the number and
subjects equally unnoticed[i191].One picture in the sacristy of Santa Maria, near St.Celsus at
Milan[i192]._A small head of Christ_, while a youth, mentioned by Lomazzo.Probably
this may be the study for the picture of Jesus disputing with the
Doctors, at the Panfili palace[i193].Michael with a man kneeling_, in the King of France's
collection[i194]._A Bacchus_, in the same collection[i195]._The fair Ferraia_, in the same collection[i196]._A portrait of a lady_, there also[i197]._A Christ with a globe in his hand_[i198].A very fine picture, half
length, now in the possession of Richard Troward, Esq.This was engraven by Hollar in 1650, in aqua fortis[i199]._The Fall of Phaeton_, in the gallery of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, of
which Scannelli speaks, but it is mentioned by no one else[i200].Catherine with a palm-branch_, in the gallery of the Duke of
Modena[i201]._The head of a young man armed_, in the same collection, very graceful,
but inferior to the St._A portrait of the Queen of Naples_, which was in the Aldobrandini
gallery, but afterwards to be found in a chamber of portraits in the
Panfili palace.It is not equal in colouring to the Dispute of Jesus
with the Doctors[i203]._A portrait in profile of the Dutchess of Milan_, mentioned by
Richardson as being in a chamber leading to the Ambrosian library[i204]._A beautiful figure of the Virgin, half length_, in the palace of
Vaprio.It is of a gigantic size, for the head of the Virgin is
six common palms in size, and that of the Divine Infant four in
circumference.Della Valle speaks of having seen this in the year 1791,
and says he is not ignorant that tradition ascribes this Madonna to
Bramante, notwithstanding which he gives it to Leonardo[i205]._A laughing Pomona with three veils_, commended by Lomazzo.It was done
for Francis I. King of France[i206]._The portrait of Cecilia Gallarani_, mentioned by Bellincione in one of
his sonnets, as painted by Leonardo[i207]._Another of Lucrezia Cavelli_, a celebrated performer on the lute,
ascribed to him on the same authority.Copies of both this and the
former may be seen at Milan[i208]._Our Saviour before Pilate_, in the church of S. Florentino, at
Amboise.It is thought that the carton only of this was Leonardo's, and
that the picture was painted by Andrea Salai, or Melzi[i209]._A portrait of Leonardo_ by himself, half length, in the Ambrosian
library at Milan[i210].Della Valle has inserted a copy of this before
the Supplement to Leonardo's Life, in his edition of Vasari, for
which purpose Sig.Pagave transmitted him a drawing from the original
picture.But Leonardo's own drawing for the picture itself, is in the
possession of his Britannic Majesty, and from that Mr.Chamberlaine
has prefixed to his publication before mentioned, a plate engraven by
Bartolozzi.A

                               TREATISE,

                                 _&c._




                               DRAWING.I./--_What the young Student in Painting ought in the first
Place to learn._


/The/ young student should, in the first place, acquire a knowledge
of perspective, to enable him to give to every object its proper
dimensions: after which, it is requisite that he be under the care of
an able master, to accustom him, by degrees, to a good style of drawing
the parts.Next, he must study Nature, in order to confirm and fix in
his mind the reason of those precepts which he has learnt.He must also
bestow some time in viewing the works of various old masters, to form
his eye and judgment, in order that he may be able to put in practice
all that he has been taught[1].II./--_Rule for a young Student in Painting._


/The/ organ of sight is one of the quickest, and takes in at a single
glance an infinite variety of forms; notwithstanding which, it cannot
perfectly comprehend more than one object at a time.For example, the
reader, at one look over this page, immediately perceives it full of
different characters; but he cannot at the same moment distinguish each
letter, much less can he comprehend their meaning.He must consider it
word by word, and line by line, if he be desirous of forming a just
notion of these characters.In like manner, if we wish to ascend to
the top of an edifice, we must be content to advance step by step,
otherwise we shall never be able to attain it.A young man, who has a natural inclination to the study of this art,
I would advise to act thus: In order to acquire a true notion of the
form of things, he must begin by studying the parts which compose
them, and not pass to a second till he has well stored his memory, and
sufficiently practised the first; otherwise he loses his time, and will
most certainly protract his studies.And let him remember to acquire
accuracy before he attempts quickness.III./--_How to discover a young Man's Disposition for Painting._


/Many/ are very desirous of learning to draw, and are very fond of it,
who are, notwithstanding, void of a proper disposition for it.This may
be known by their want of perseverance; like boys, who draw every thing
in a hurry, never finishing, or shadowing.IV./--_Of Painting, and its Divisions._


/Painting/ is divided into two principal parts.The first is the figure,
that is, the lines which distinguish the forms of bodies, and their
component parts.The second is the colour contained within those limits.V./--_Division of the Figure._


/The/ form of bodies is divided into two parts; that is, the proportion
of the members to each other, which must correspond with the whole; and
the motion, expressive of what passes in the mind of the living figure.VI./--_Proportion of Members._


/The/ proportion of members is again divided into two parts, viz.By equality is meant (besides the measure
corresponding with the whole), that you do not confound the members
of a young subject with those of old age, nor plump ones with those
that are lean; and that, moreover, you do not blend the robust and firm
muscles of man with feminine softness: that the attitudes and motions
of old age be not expressed with the quickness and alacrity of youth;
nor those of a female figure like those of a vigorous young man.The
motions and members of a strong man should be such as to express his
perfect state of health.VII./--_Of Dimensions in general._


/In/ general, the dimensions of the human body are to be considered
in the length, and not in the breadth; because in the wonderful works
of Nature, which we endeavour to imitate, we cannot in any species
find any one part in one model precisely similar to the same part in
another.Let us be attentive, therefore, to the variation of forms,
and avoid all monstrosities of proportion; such as long legs united
to short bodies, and narrow chests with long arms.Observe also
attentively the measure of joints, in which Nature is apt to vary
considerably; and imitate her example by doing the same.VIII./--_Motion, Changes, and Proportion of Members._


/The/ measures of the human body vary in each member, according as it
is more or less bent, or seen in different views, increasing on one
side as much as they diminish on the other.IX./--_The Difference of Proportion between Children and grown
Men._


/In/ men and children I find a great difference between the joints of
the one and the other in the length of the bones.A man has the length
of two heads from the extremity of one shoulder to the other, the same
from the shoulder to the elbow, and from the elbow to the fingers; but
the child has only one, because Nature gives the proper size first to
the seat of the intellect, and afterwards to the other parts.X./--_The Alterations in the Proportion of the human Body from
Infancy to full Age._


/A man/, in his infancy, has the breadth of his shoulders equal to the
length of the face, and to the length of the arm from the shoulder
to the elbow, when the arm is bent[2].It is the same again from the
lower belly to the knee, and from the knee to the foot.But, when a
man is arrived at the period of his full growth, every one of these
dimensions becomes double in length, except the face, which, with
the top of the head, undergoes but very little alteration in length.A well-proportioned and full-grown man, therefore, is ten times the
length of his face; the breadth of his shoulders will be two faces, and
in like manner all the above lengths will be double.The rest will be
explained in the general measurement of the human body[3].XI./--_Of the Proportion of Members._


/All/ the parts of any animal whatever must be correspondent with
the whole.So that, if the body be short and thick, all the members
belonging to it must be the same.One that is long and thin must have
its parts of the same kind; and so of the middle size.Something of the
same may be observed in plants, when uninjured by men or tempests; for
when thus injured they bud and grow again, making young shoots from old
plants, and by those means destroying their natural symmetry.XII./--_That every Part be proportioned to its Whole._


/If/ a man be short and thick, be careful that all his members be
of the same nature, viz.short arms and thick, large hands, short
fingers, with broad joints; and so of the rest.XIII./--_Of the Proportion of the Members._


/Measure/ upon yourself the proportion of the parts, and, if you find
any of them defective, note it down, and be very careful to avoid it in
drawing your own compositions.For this is reckoned a common fault in
painters, to delight in the imitation of themselves.XIV./--_The Danger of forming an erroneous Judgment in regard to
the Proportion and Beauty of the Parts._


/If/ the painter has clumsy hands, he will be apt to introduce them
into his works, and so of any other part of his person, which may not
happen to be so beautiful as it ought to be.He must, therefore, guard
particularly against that self-love, or too good opinion of his own
person, and study by every means to acquire the knowledge of what is
most beautiful, and of his own defects, that he may adopt the one and
avoid the other.XV./--_Another Precept._


/The/ young painter must, in the first instance, accustom his hand to
copying the drawings of good masters; and when his hand is thus formed,
and ready, he should, with the advice of his director, use himself also
to draw from relievos; according to the rules we shall point out in the
treatise on drawing from relievos[4].XVI./--_The Manner of drawing from Relievos, and rendering Paper
fit for it._


/When/ you draw from relievos, tinge your paper of some darkish
demi-tint.And after you have made your outline, put in the darkest
shadows, and, last of all, the principal lights, but sparingly,
especially the smaller ones; because those are easily lost to the eye
at a very moderate distance[5].XVII./--_Of drawing from Casts or Nature._


/In/ drawing from relievo, the draftsman must place himself in such a
manner, as that the eye of the figure to be drawn be level with his
own[6].XVIII./--_To draw Figures from Nature._


/Accustom/ yourself to hold a plummet in your hand, that you may judge
of the bearing of the parts.XIX./--_Of drawing from Nature._


/When/ you draw from Nature, you must be at the distance of three times
the height of the object; and when you begin to draw, form in your own
mind a certain principal line (suppose a perpendicular); observe well
the bearing of the parts towards that line; whether they intersect, are
parallel to it, or oblique.XX./--_Of drawing Academy Figures._


/When/ you draw from a naked model, always sketch in the whole of the
figure, suiting all the members well to each other; and though you
finish only that part which appears the best, have a regard to the
rest, that, whenever you make use of such studies, all the parts may
hang together.In composing your attitudes, take care not to turn the head on the same
side as the breast, nor let the arm go in a line with the leg[7].If
the head turn towards the right shoulder, the parts must be lower on
the left side than on the other; but if the chest come forward, and the
head turn towards the left, the parts on the right side are to be the
highest.XXI./--_Of studying in the Dark, on first waking in the Morning,
and before going to sleep._


/I have/ experienced no small benefit, when in the dark and in bed, by
retracing in my mind the outlines of those forms which I had previously
studied, particularly such as had appeared the most difficult to
comprehend and retain; by this method they will be confirmed and
treasured up in the memory.XXII./--_Observations on drawing Portraits._


/The/ cartilage, which raises the nose in the middle of the face,
varies in eight different ways.It is equally straight, equally
concave, or equally convex, which is the first sort.Or, secondly,
unequally straight, concave, or convex.Or, thirdly, straight in the
upper part, and concave in the under.Or, fourthly, straight again
in the upper part, and convex in those below.Or, fifthly, it may be
concave and straight beneath.Or, sixthly, concave above, and convex
below.Or, seventhly, it may be convex in the upper part, and straight
in the lower.And in the eighth and last place, convex above, and
concave beneath.The uniting of the nose with the brows is in two ways, either it is
straight or concave.It is
straight, concave, or round.The first is divided into two parts, viz.it is either convex in the upper part, or in the lower, sometimes both;
or else flat above and below.XXIII./--_The Method of retaining in the Memory the Likeness of
a Man, so as to draw his Profile, after having seen him only once._


/You/ must observe and remember well the variations of the four
principal features in the profile; the nose, mouth, chin, and forehead.And first of the nose, of which there are three different sorts[8],
straight, concave, and convex.Of the straight there are but four
variations, short or long, high at the end, or low.Of the concave
there are three sorts; some have the concavity above, some in the
middle, and some at the end.The convex noses also vary three ways;
some project in the upper part, some in the middle, and others at the
bottom.Nature, which seems to delight in infinite variety, gives again
three changes to those noses which have a projection in the middle; for
some have it straight, some concave, and some convex.XXIV./--_How to remember the Form of a Face._


/If/ you wish to retain with facility the general look of a face, you
must first learn how to draw well several faces, mouths, eyes, noses,
chins, throats, necks, and shoulders; in short, all those principal
parts which distinguish one man from another.For instance, noses are
often different sorts[9].Straight, bunched, concave, some raised
above, some below the middle, aquiline, flat, round, and sharp.In the front view there are eleven different sorts.Even, thick in the middle, thin in the middle, thick at the tip, thin
at the beginning, thin at the tip, and thick at the beginning.Broad,
narrow, high, and low nostrils; some with a large opening, and some
more shut towards the tip.The same variety will be found in the other parts of the face, which
must be drawn from Nature, and retained in the memory.Or else, when
you mean to draw a likeness from memory, take with you a pocket-book,
in which you have marked all these variations of features, and after
having given a look at the face you mean to draw, retire a little
aside, and note down in your book which of the features are similar to
it; that you may put it all together at home.XXV./--_That a Painter should take Pleasure in the Opinion of
every body._


/A painter/ ought not certainly to refuse listening to the opinion of
any one; for we know that, although a man be not a painter, he may have
just notions of the forms of men; whether a man has a hump on his back,
a thick leg, or a large hand; whether he be lame, or have any other
defect.Now, if we know that men are able to judge of the works of
Nature, should we not think them more able to detect our errors?XXVI./--_What is principally to be observed in Figures._


/The/ principal and most important consideration required in drawing
figures, is to set the head well upon the shoulders, the chest upon the
hips, the hips and shoulders upon the feet.XXVII./--_Mode of Studying._


/Study/ the science first, and then follow the practice which results
from that science.Pursue method in your study, and do not quit one
part till it be perfectly engraven in the memory; and observe what
difference there is between the members of animals and their joints[10].XXVIII./--_Of being universal._


/It/ is an easy matter for a man who is well versed in the principles
of his art, to become universal in the practice of it, since all
animals have a similarity of members, that is, muscles, tendons, bones,
&c. These only vary in length or thickness, as will be demonstrated
in the Anatomy[11].As for aquatic animals, of which there is great
variety, I shall not persuade the painter to take them as a rule,
having no connexion with our purpose.XXIX./--_A Precept for the Painter._


/It/ reflects no great honour on a painter to be able to execute only
one thing well, such as a head, an academy figure, or draperies,
animals, landscape, or the like, confining himself to some particular
object of study; because there is scarcely a person so void of genius
as to fail of success, if he apply earnestly to one branch of study,
and practise it continually.XXX./--_Of the Measures of the human Body, and the bending of
Members._


/It/ is very necessary that painters should have a knowledge of
the bones which support the flesh by which they are covered, but
particularly of the joints, which increase and diminish the length of
them in their appearance.As in the arm, which does not measure the
same when bent, as when extended; its difference between the greatest
extension and bending, is about one eighth of its length.The increase
and diminution of the arm is effected by the bone projecting out of
its socket at the elbow; which, as is seen in figure A B, Plate I. is
lengthened from the shoulder to the elbow; the angle it forms being
less than a right angle.It will appear longer as that angle becomes
more acute, and will shorten in proportion as it becomes more open or
obtuse._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.XXXI./--_Of the small Bones in several Joints of the human Body._


/There/ are in the joints of the human body certain small bones, fixed
in the middle of the tendons which connect several of the joints.Such
are the patellas of the knees, and the joints of the shoulders, and
those of the feet.They are eight in number, one at each shoulder, one
at each knee, and two at each foot under the first joint of the great
toe towards the heel.These grow extremely hard as a man advances in
years.XXXII./--_Memorandum to be observed by the Painter._


/Note/ down which muscles and tendons are brought into action by the
motion of any member, and when they are hidden.Remember that these
remarks are of the greatest importance to painters and sculptors, who
profess to study anatomy, and the science of the muscles.Do the same
with children, following the different gradations of age from their
birth even to decrepitude, describing the changes which the members,
and particularly the joints, undergo; which of them grow fat, and which
lean.XXXIII./--_The Shoulders._


/The/ joints of the shoulders, and other parts which bend, shall be
noticed in their places in the Treatise on Anatomy, where the cause
of the motions of all the parts which compose the human body shall be
explained[12].XXXIV./--_The Difference of Joints between Children and grown
Men._


/Young/ children have all their joints small, but they are thick and
plump in the spaces between them; because there is nothing upon the
bones at the joints, but some tendons to bind the bones together.The
soft flesh, which is full of fluids, is enclosed under the skin in the
space between the joints; and as the bones are bigger at the joints
than in the space between them, the skin throws off in the progress to
manhood that superfluity, and draws nearer to the bones, thinning the
whole part together.But upon the joints it does not lessen, as there
is nothing but cartilages and tendons.For these reasons children are
small in the joints, and plump in the space between, as may be observed
in their fingers, arms, and narrow shoulders.Men, on the contrary, are
large and full in the joints, in the arms and legs; and where children
have hollows, men are knotty and prominent.XXXV./--_Of the Joints of the Fingers._


/The/ joints of the fingers appear larger on all sides when they
bend; the more they bend the larger they appear.It is the same in the toes, and it will be more
perceptible in proportion to their fleshiness.XXXVI./--_Of the Joint of the Wrist._


/The/ wrist or joint between the hand and arm lessens on closing the
hand, and grows larger when it opens.The contrary happens in the arm,
in the space between the elbow and the hand, on all sides; because in
opening the hand the muscles are extended and thinned in the arm, from
the elbow to the wrist; but when the hand is shut, the same muscles
swell and shorten.The tendons alone start, being stretched by the
clenching of the hand.XXXVII./--_Of the Joint of the Foot._


/The/ increase and diminution in the joint of the foot is produced
on that side where the tendons are seen, as D E F, _Plate I._ which
increases when the angle is acute, and diminishes when it becomes
obtuse.It must be understood of the joint in the front part of the
foot A B C.XXXVIII./--_Of the Knee._


/Of/ all the members which have pliable joints, the knee is the only
one that lessens in the bending, and becomes larger by extension.XXXIX./--_Of the Joints._


/All/ the joints of the human body become larger by bending, except
that of the leg.XL./--_Of the Naked._


/When/ a figure is to appear nimble and delicate, its muscles must
never be too much marked, nor are any of them to be much swelled.Because such figures are expressive of activity and swiftness, and are
never loaded with much flesh upon the bones.They are made light by the
want of flesh, and where there is but little flesh there cannot be any
thickness of muscles.XLI./--_Of the Thickness of the Muscles._


/Muscular/ men have large bones, and are in general thick and short,
with very little fat; because the fleshy muscles in their growth
contract closer together, and the fat, which in other instances lodges
between them, has no room.The muscles in such thin subjects, not being
able to extend, grow in thickness, particularly towards their middle,
in the parts most removed from the extremities.XLII./--_Fat Subjects have small Muscles._


/Though/ fat people have this in common with muscular men, that they
are frequently short and thick, they have thin muscles; but their skin
contains a great deal of spongy and soft flesh full of air; for that
reason they are lighter upon the water, and swim better than muscular
people.XLIII./--_Which of the Muscles disappear in the different
Motions of the Body._


/In/ raising or lowering the arm, the pectoral muscles disappear, or
acquire a greater relievo.A similar effect is produced by the hips,
when they bend either inwards or outwards.It is to be observed, that
there is more variety of appearances in the shoulders, hips, and neck,
than in any other joint, because they are susceptible of the greatest
variety of motions.But of this subject I shall make a separate
treatise[13].XLIV./--_Of the Muscles._


/The/ muscles are not to be scrupulously marked all the way, because it
would be disagreeable to the sight, and of very difficult execution.But on that side only where the members are in action, they should
be pronounced more strongly; for muscles that are at work naturally
collect all their parts together, to gain increase of strength, so
that some small parts of those muscles will appear, that were not seen
before.XLV./--_Of the Muscles._


/The/ muscles of young men are not to be marked strongly, nor too much
swelled, because that would indicate full strength and vigour of age,
which they have not yet attained.Nevertheless they must be more or
less expressed, as they are more or less employed.For those which are
in motion are always more swelled and thicker than those which remain
at rest.The intrinsic and central line of the members which are bent,
never retains its natural length.XLVI./--_The Extension and Contraction of the Muscles._


/The/ muscle at the back part of the thigh shows more variety in
its extension and contraction, than any other in the human body; the
second, in that respect, are those which compose the buttocks; the
third, those of the back; the fourth, those of the neck; the fifth,
those of the shoulders; and the sixth, those of the Abdomen, which,
taking their rise under the breast, terminate under the lower belly; as
I shall explain when I speak of each.XLVII./--_Of the Muscle between the Chest and the lower Belly._


/There/ is a muscle which begins under the breast at the Sternum, and
is inserted into, or terminates at the Os pubis, under the lower belly.It is called the Rectus of the Abdomen; it is divided, lengthways,
into three principal portions, by transverse tendinous intersections
or ligaments, viz.the superior part, and a ligament; the second part,
with its ligaments; and the third part, with the third ligament;
which last unites by tendons to the Os pubis.These divisions and
intersections of the same muscle are intended by nature to facilitate
the motion when the body is bent or distended.If it were made of one
piece, it would produce too much variety when extended, or contracted,
and also would be considerably weaker.When this muscle has but little
variety in the motion of the body, it is more beautiful[14].XLVIII./--_Of a Man's complex Strength, but first of the Arm._


/The/ muscles which serve either to straighten or bend the arm, arise
from the different processes of the Scapula; some of them from the
protuberances of the Humerus, and others about the middle of the Os
humeri.The extensors of the arm arise from behind, and the flexors
from before.That a man has more power in pulling than in pushing, has been proved
by the ninth proposition De Ponderibus[15], where it is said, that of
two equal weights, that will have the greatest power which is farthest
removed from the pole or centre of its balance.It follows then of
course, that the muscle N B, _Plate II._ and the muscle N C, being of
equal power, the inner muscle N C, will nevertheless be stronger than
the outward one N B, because it is inserted into the arm at C, a point
farther removed from the centre of the elbow A, than B, which is on
the other side of such centre, so that that question is determined.But this is a simple power, and I thought it best to explain it before
I mentioned the complex power of the muscles, of which I must now
take notice.The complex power, or strength, is, for instance, this,
when the arm is going to act, a second power is added to it (such as
the weight of the body and the strength of the legs, in pulling or
pushing), consisting in the extension of the parts, as when two men
attempt to throw down a column; the one by pushing, and the other by
pulling[16].XLIX./--_In which of the two Actions, Pulling or Pushing, a Man
has the greatest Power_, Plate II./A man/ has the greatest power in pulling, for in that action he has
the united exertion of all the muscles of the arm, while some of them
must be inactive when he is pushing; because when the arm is extended
for that purpose, the muscles which move the elbow cannot act, any
more than if he pushed with his shoulders against the column he means
to throw down; in which case only the muscles that extend the back,
the legs under the thigh, and the calves of the legs, would be active.From which we conclude, that in pulling there is added to the power
of extension the strength of the arms, of the legs, of the back, and
even of the chest, if the oblique motion of the body require it.But
in pushing, though all the parts were employed, yet the strength of
the muscles of the arms is wanting; for to push with an extended arm
without motion does not help more than if a piece of wood were placed
from the shoulder to the column meant to be pushed down._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.L./--_Of the bending of Members, and of the Flesh round the
bending Joint._


/The/ flesh which covers the bones near and at the joints, swells or
diminishes in thickness according to their bending or extension; that
is, it increases at the inside of the angle formed by the bending, and
grows narrow and lengthened on the outward side of the exterior angle.The middle between the convex and concave angle participates of this
increase or diminution, but in a greater or less degree as the parts
are nearer to, or farther from, the angles of the bending joints.LI./--_Of the naked Body._


/The/ members of naked men who work hard in different attitudes, will
shew the muscles more strongly on that side where they act forcibly to
bring the part into action; and the other muscles will be more or less
marked, in proportion as they co-operate in the same motion.LII./--_Of a Ligament without Muscles._


/Where/ the arm joins with the hand, there is a ligament, the largest
in the human body, which is without muscles, and is called the strong
ligament of the Carpus; it has a square shape, and serves to bind
and keep close together the bones of the arm, and the tendons of the
fingers, and prevent their dilating, or starting out.LIII./--_Of Creases._


/In/ bending the joints the flesh will always form a crease on the
opposite side to that where it is tight.LIV./--_How near behind the Back one Arm can be brought to the
other_, Plate III./When/ the arms are carried behind the back, the elbows can never be
brought nearer than the length from the elbow to the end of the longest
finger; so that the fingers will not be seen beyond the elbows, and
in that situation, the arms with the shoulders form a perfect square.The greatest extension of the arm across the chest is, when the elbow
comes over the pit of the stomach; the elbow and the shoulder in this
position, will form an equilateral triangle.LV./--_Of the Muscles._


/A naked/ figure being strongly marked, so as to give a distinct view
of all the muscles, will not express any motion; because it cannot
move, if some of its muscles do not relax while the others are pulling.Those which relax cease to appear in proportion as the others pull
strongly and become apparent._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

/Chap.LVI./--_Of the Muscles._


/The/ muscles of the human body are to be more or less marked according
to their degree of action.Those only which act are to be shewn, and
the more forcibly they act, the stronger they should be pronounced.Those that do not act at all must remain soft and flat.LVII./--_Of the Bending of the Body._


/The/ bodies of men diminish as much on the side which bends, as they
increase on the opposite side.That diminution may at last become
double, in proportion to the extension on the other side.But of this I
shall make a separate treatise[17].LVIII./--_The same Subject._


/The/ body which bends, lengthens as much on one side as it shortens
on the other; but the central line between them will never lessen or
increase.LIX./--_The Necessity of anatomical Knowledge._


/The/ painter who has obtained a perfect knowledge of the nature of the
tendons and muscles, and of those parts which contain the most of them,
will know to a certainty, in giving a particular motion to any part of
the body, which, and how many of the muscles give rise and contribute
to it; which of them, by swelling, occasion their shortening, and which
of the cartilages they surround.He will not imitate those who, in all the different attitudes they
adopt, or invent, make use of the same muscles, in the arms, back, or
chest, or any other parts.MOTION AND EQUIPOISE OF FIGURES.LX./--_Of the Equipoise of a Figure standing still._


/The/ non-existence of motion in any animal resting on its feet, is
owing to the equality of weight distributed on each side of the line of
gravity.LXI./--_Motion produced by the Loss of Equilibrium._


/Motion/ is created by the loss of due equipoise, that is, by
inequality of weight; for nothing can move of itself, without losing
its centre of gravity, and the farther that is removed, the quicker and
stronger will be the motion._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.LXII./--_Of the Equipoise of Bodies_, Plate V./The/ balance or equipoise of parts in the human body is of two sorts,
viz.Simple, when a man stands upon his feet
without motion: in that situation, if he extends his arms at different
distances from the middle, or stoop, the centre of his weight will
always be in a perpendicular line upon the centre of that foot which
supports the body; and if he rests equally upon both feet, then the
middle of the chest will be perpendicular to the middle of the line
which measures the space between the centres of his feet.The complex balance is, when a man carries a weight not his own, which
he bears by different motions; as in the figure of Hercules stifling
Anteus, by pressing him against his breast with his arms, after he has
lifted him from the ground.He must have as much of his own weight
thrown behind the central line of his feet, as the weight of Anteus
adds before.LXIII./--_Of Positions._


/The/ pit of the neck, between the two Clavicles, falls perpendicularly
with the foot which bears the weight of the body.If one of the arms be
thrown forwards, this pit will quit that perpendicular; and if one of
the legs goes back, that pit is brought forwards, and so changes its
situation at every change of posture.LXIV./--_Of balancing the Weight round the Centre of Gravity in
Bodies._


/A figure/ standing upon its feet without motion, will form an
equipoise of all its members round the centre of its support.If this figure without motion, and resting upon its feet, happens to
move one of its arms forwards, it must necessarily throw as much of its
weight on the opposite side, as is equal to that of the extended arm
and the accidental weight.And the same I say of every part, which is
brought out beyond its usual balance.LXV./--_Of Figures that have to lift up, or carry any Weight._


/A weight/ can never be lifted up or carried by any man, if he do not
throw more than an equal weight of his own on the opposite side.LXVI./--_The Equilibrium of a Man standing upon his Feet_, Plate
VI./The/ weight of a man resting upon one leg will always be equally
divided on each side of the central or perpendicular line of gravity,
which supports him.LXVII./--_Of Walking_, Plate VII./A man/ walking will always have the centre of gravity over the centre
of the leg which rests upon the ground._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

[Illustration:
_Page 28_._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.LXVIII./--_Of the Centre of Gravity in Men and Animals._


/The/ legs, or centre of support, in men and animals, will approach
nearer to the centre of gravity, in proportion to the slowness of their
motion; and, on the contrary, when the motion is quicker, they will be
farther removed from that perpendicular line.LXIX./--_Of the corresponding Thickness of Parts on each Side of
the Body._


/The/ thickness or breadth of the parts in the human body will never be
equal on each side, if the corresponding members do not move equally
and alike.LXX./--_Of the Motions of Animals._


/All/ bipeds in their motions lower the part immediately over the foot
that is raised, more than over that resting on the ground, and the
highest parts do just the contrary.This is observable in the hips and
shoulders of a man when he walks; and also in birds in the head and
rump.LXXI./--_Of Quadrupeds and their Motions._


/The/ highest parts of quadrupeds are susceptible of more variation
when they walk, than when they are still, in a greater or less degree,
in proportion to their size.This proceeds from the oblique position of
their legs when they touch the ground, which raise the animal when they
become straight and perpendicular upon the ground.LXXII./--_Of the Quickness or Slowness of Motion._


/The/ motion performed by a man, or any other animal whatever, in
walking, will have more or less velocity as the centre of their weight
is more or less removed from the centre of that foot upon which they
are supported.LXXIII./--_Of the Motion of Animals._


/That/ figure will appear the swiftest in its course which leans the
most forwards.Any body, moving of itself, will do it with more or less velocity
in proportion as the centre of its gravity is more or less removed
from the centre of its support.This is mentioned chiefly in regard
to the motion of birds, which, without any clapping of their wings,
or assistance of wind, move themselves.This happens when the centre
of their gravity is out of the centre of their support, viz.out of
its usual residence, the middle between the two wings.Because, if
the middle of the wings be more backward than the centre of the whole
weight, the bird will move forwards and downwards, in a greater or
less degree as the centre of its weight is more or less removed from
the middle of its wings.From which it follows, that if the centre of
gravity be far removed from the other centre, the descent of the bird
will be very oblique; but if that centre be near the middle of the
wings, the descent will have very little obliquity._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.LXXIV./--_Of a Figure moving against the Wind_, Plate VIII./A man/ moving against the wind in any direction does not keep his
centre of gravity duly disposed upon the centre of support[18].LXXV./--_Of the Balance of a Figure resting upon its Feet._


/The/ man who rests upon his feet, either bears the weight of his body
upon them equally, or unequally.If equally, it will be with some
accidental weight, or simply with his own; if it be with an additional
weight, the opposite extremities of his members will not be equally
distant from the perpendicular of his feet.But if he simply carries
his own weight, the opposite extremities will be equally distant from
the perpendicular of his feet: and on this subject of gravity I shall
write a separate book[19].LXXVI./--_A Precept._


/The/ navel is always in the central or middle line of the body, which
passes through the pit of the stomach to that of the neck, and must
have as much weight, either accidental or natural, on one side of the
human figure as on the other.This is demonstrated by extending the
arm, the wrist of which performs the office of a weight at the end of
a steelyard; and will require some weight to be thrown on the other
side of the navel, to counterbalance that of the wrist.It is on that
account that the heel is often raised.LXXVII./--_Of a Man standing, but resting more upon one Foot
than the other._


/After/ a man, by standing long, has tired the leg upon which he
rests, he sends part of his weight upon the other leg.But this kind
of posture is to be employed only for old age, infancy, or extreme
lassitude, because it expresses weariness, or very little power in the
limbs.For that reason, a young man, strong and healthy, will always
rest upon one of his legs, and if he removes a little of his weight
upon the other, it is only a necessary preparative to motion, without
which it is impossible to move; as we have proved before, that motion
proceeds from inequality[20].LXXVIII./--_Of the Balance of Figures_, Plate IX./If/ the figure rests upon one foot, the shoulder on that side will
always be lower than the other; and the pit of the neck will fall
perpendicularly over the middle of that leg which supports the body.The same will happen in whatever other view we see that figure, when it
has not the arm much extended, nor any weight on its back, in its hand,
or on its shoulder, and when it does not, either behind or before,
throw out that leg which does not support the body._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

[Illustration:
_Page 33_._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.LXXIX./--_In what Manner extending one Arm alters the Balance._


/The/ extending of the arm, which was bent, removes the weight of the
figure upon the foot which bears the weight of the whole body: as is
observable in rope-dancers, who dance upon the rope with their arms
open, without any pole.LXXX./--_Of a Man bearing a Weight on his Shoulders_, Plate X./The/ shoulder which bears the weight is always higher than the other.This is seen in the figure opposite, in which the centre line passes
through the whole, with an equal weight on each side, to the leg on
which it rests.If the weight were not equally divided on each side
of this central line of gravity, the whole would fall to the ground.But Nature has provided, that as much of the natural weight of the man
should be thrown on one side, as of accidental weight on the other,
to form a counterpoise.This is effected by the man's bending, and
leaning on the side not loaded, so as to form an equilibrium to the
accidental weight he carries; and this cannot be done, unless the
loaded shoulder be raised, and the other lowered.This is the resource
with which Nature has furnished a man on such occasions.LXXXI./--_Of Equilibrium._


/Any/ figure bearing an additional weight out of the central line, must
throw as much natural or accidental weight on the opposite side as is
sufficient to form a counterpoise round that line, which passes from
the pit of the neck, through the whole mass of weight, to that part
of the foot which rests upon the ground.We observe, that when a man
lifts a weight with one arm, he naturally throws out the opposite arm;
and if that be not enough to form an equipoise, he will add as much of
his own weight, by bending his body, as will enable him to resist such
accidental load.We see also, that a man ready to fall sideways and
backwards at the same time, always throws out the arm on the opposite
side.LXXXII./--_Of Motion._


/Whether/ a man moves with velocity or slowness, the parts above the
leg which sustains the weight, will always be lower than the others on
the opposite side.LXXXIII./--_The Level of the Shoulders._


/The/ shoulders or sides of a man, or any other animal, will preserve
less of their level, in proportion to the slowness of their motion;
and, _vice versa_, those parts will lose less of their level when the
motion is quicker.This is proved by the ninth proposition, treating of
local motions, where it is said, any weight will press in the direction
of the line of its motion; therefore the whole moving towards any one
point, the parts belonging to it will follow the shortest line of the
motion of its whole, without giving any of its weight to the collateral
parts of the whole._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

/Chap.LXXXIV./--_Objection to the above answered_, Plate XI./It/ has been objected, in regard to the first part of the above
proposition, that it does not follow that a man standing still, or
moving slowly, has his members always in perfect balance upon the
centre of gravity; because we do not find that Nature always follows
that rule, but, on the contrary, the figure will sometimes bend
sideways, standing upon one foot; sometimes it will rest part of its
weight upon that leg which is bent at the knee, as is seen in the
figures B C. But I shall reply thus, that what is not performed by the
shoulders in the figure C, is done by the hip, as is demonstrated in
another place.LXXXV./--_Of the Position of Figures_, Plate XIII./In/ the same proportion as that part of the naked figure marked D A,
lessens in height from the shoulder to the hip, on account of its
position the opposite side increases.And this is the reason: the
figure resting upon one (suppose the left) foot, that foot becomes the
centre of all the weight above; and the pit of the neck, formed by the
junction of the two Clavicles, quits also its natural situation at the
upper extremity of the perpendicular line (which passes through the
middle surface of the body), to bend over the same foot; and as this
line bends with it, it forces the transverse lines, which are always at
right angles, to lower their extremities on that side where the foot
rests, as appears in A B C. The navel and middle parts always preserve
their natural height.LXXXVI./--_Of the Joints._


/In/ the bending of the joints it is particularly useful to observe the
difference and variety of shape they assume; how the muscles swell on
one side, while they flatten on the other; and this is more apparent in
the neck, because the motion of it is of three sorts, two of which are
simple motions, and the other complex, participating also of the other
two.The simple motions are, first, when the neck bends towards the
shoulder, either to the right or left, and when it raises or lowers
the head.The second is, when it twists to the right or left, without
rising or bending, but straight, with the head turned towards one of
the shoulders.The third motion, which is called complex, is, when to
the bending of it is added the twisting, as when the ear leans towards
one of the shoulders, the head turning the same way, and the face
turned upwards.LXXXVII./--_Of the Shoulders._


/Of/ those which the shoulders can perform, simple motions are the
principal, such as moving the arm upwards and downwards, backwards and
forwards.Though one might almost call those motions infinite, for if
the arm can trace a circle upon a wall, it will have performed all the
motions belonging to the shoulders.Every continued quantity being
divisible _ad infinitum_, and this circle being a continued quantity,
produced by the motion of the arm going through every part of the
circumference, it follows, that the motions of the shoulders may also be
said to be infinite._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.LXXXVIII./--_Of the Motions of a Man._


/When/ you mean to represent a man removing a weight, consider that the
motions are various, viz.either a simple motion, by bending himself
to raise the weight from the ground upwards, or when he drags the
weight after him, or pushes it before him, or pulls it down with a rope
passing through a pulley.It is to be observed, that the weight of the
man's body pulls the more in proportion as the centre of his gravity
is removed from the centre of his support.To this must be added the
strength of the effort that the legs and back make when they are bent,
to return to their natural straight situation.A man never ascends or descends, nor walks at all in any direction,
without raising the heel of the back foot.LXXXIX./--_Of the Disposition of Members preparing to act with
great Force_, Plate XIV./When/ a man prepares himself to strike a violent blow, he bends and
twists his body as far as he can to the side contrary to that which
he means to strike, and collecting all his strength, he, by a complex
motion, returns and falls upon the point he has in view[21].XC./--_Of throwing any Thing with Violence_, Plate XV./A man/ throwing a dart, a stone, or any thing else with violence,
may be represented, chiefly, two different ways; that is, he may be
preparing to do it, or the act may be already performed.If you mean to
place him in the act of preparation, the inside of the foot upon which
he rests will be under the perpendicular line of the pit of the neck;
and if it be the right foot, the left shoulder will be perpendicular
over the toes of the same foot.XCI./--_On the Motion of driving any Thing into or drawing it
out of the Ground._


/He/ who wishes to pitch a pole into the ground, or draw one out of it,
will raise the leg and bend the knee opposite to the arm which acts,
in order to balance himself upon the foot that rests, without which he
could neither drive in, nor pull out any thing.XCII./--_Of forcible Motions_, Plate XVI./Of/ the two arms, that will be most powerful in its effort, which,
having been farthest removed from its natural situation, is assisted
more strongly by the other parts to bring it to the place where it
means to go.As the man A, who moves the arm with a club E, and brings
it to the opposite side B, assisted by the motion of the whole body._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

/Chap.XCIII./--_The Action of Jumping._


/Nature/ will of itself, and without any reasoning in the mind of a man
going to jump, prompt him to raise his arms and shoulders by a sudden
motion, together with a great part of his body, and to lift them up
high, till the power of the effort subsides.This impetuous motion
is accompanied by an instantaneous extension of the body which had
bent itself, like a spring or bow, along the back, the joints of the
thighs, knees, and feet, and is let off obliquely, that is, upwards
and forwards; so that the disposition of the body tending forwards
and upwards, makes it describe a great arch when it springs up, which
increases the leap.XCIV./--_Of the three Motions in jumping upwards._


/When/ a man jumps upwards, the motion of the head is three times
quicker than that of the heel, before the extremity of the foot quits
the ground, and twice as quick as that of the hips; because three
angles are opened and extended at the same time: the superior one is
that formed by the body at its joint with the thigh before, the second
is at the joint of the thighs and legs behind, and the third is at the
instep before[22].XCV./--_Of the easy Motions of Members._


/In/ regard to the freedom and ease of motions, it is very necessary
to observe, that when you mean to represent a figure which has to turn
itself a little round, the feet and all the other members are not to
move in the same direction as the head.But you will divide that motion
among four joints, viz.the feet, the knees, the hips, and the neck.If it rests upon the right leg, the left knee should be a little bent
inward, with its foot somewhat raised outward.The left shoulder should
be lower than the other, and the nape of the neck turned on the same
side as the outward ankle of the left foot, and the left shoulder
perpendicular over the great toe of the right foot.And take it as a
general maxim, that figures do not turn their heads straight with the
chest, Nature having for our convenience formed the neck so as to turn
with ease on every side, when the eyes want to look round; and to this
the other joints are in some measure subservient.If the figure be
sitting, and the arms have some employment across the body, the breast
will turn over the joint of the hip._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.XCVI./--_The greatest Twist which a Man can make, in turning to
look at himself behind._ Plate XVII./The/ greatest twist that the body can perform is when the back of
the heels and the front of the face are seen at the same time.It is
not done without difficulty, and is effected by bending the leg and
lowering the shoulder on that side towards which the head turns.The
cause of this motion, and also which of the muscles move first and
which last, I shall explain in my treatise on anatomy[23].XCVII./--_Of turning the Leg without the Thigh._


/It/ is impossible to turn the leg inwards or outwards without turning
the thigh by the same motion, because the setting in of the bones at
the knee is such, that they have no motion but backwards and forwards,
and no more than is necessary for walking or kneeling; never sideways,
because the form of the bones at the joint of the knee does not allow
it.If this joint had been made pliable on all sides, as that of the
shoulder, or that of the thigh bone with the hip, a man would have
had his legs bent on each side as often as backwards and forwards,
and seldom or never straight with the thigh.Besides, this joint can
bend only one way, so that in walking it can never go beyond the
straight line of the leg; it bends only forwards, for if it could bend
backwards, a man could never get up again upon his feet, if once he
were kneeling; as when he means to get up from the kneeling posture (on
both knees), he gives the whole weight of his body to one of the knees
to support, unloading the other, which at that time feels no other
weight than its own, and therefore is lifted up with ease, and rests
his foot flat upon the ground; then returning the whole weight upon
that foot, and leaning his hand upon his knee, he at once extends the
other arm, raises his head, and straightening the thigh with the body,
he springs up, and rests upon the same foot, while he brings up the
other.XCVIII./--_Postures of Figures._


/Figures/ that are set in a fixed attitude, are nevertheless to have
some contrast of parts.If one arm come before, the other remains
still or goes behind.If the figure rest upon one leg, the shoulder on
that side will be lower than the other.This is observed by artists
of judgment, who always take care to balance the figure well upon its
feet, for fear it should appear to fall.Because by resting upon one
foot, the other leg, being a little bent, does not support the body any
more than if it were dead; therefore it is necessary that the parts
above that leg should transfer the centre of their weight upon the leg
which supports the body.XCIX./--_Of the Gracefulness of the Members._


/The/ members are to be suited to the body in graceful motions,
expressive of the meaning which the figure is intended to convey.If it had to give the idea of genteel and agreeable carriage, the
members must be slender and well turned, but not lean; the muscles very
slightly marked, indicating in a soft manner such as must necessarily
appear; the arms, particularly, pliant, and no member in a straight
line with any other adjoining member.If it happen, on account of the
motion of the figure, that the right hip be higher than the left, make
the joint of the shoulder fall perpendicularly on the highest part of
that hip; and let that right shoulder be lower than the left.The pit
of the neck will always be perpendicular over the middle of the instep
of the foot that supports the body.The leg that does not bear will
have its knee a little lower than the other, and near the other leg.In regard to the positions of the head and arms, they are infinite, and
for that reason I shall not enter into any detailed rule concerning
them; suffice it to say, that they are to be easy and free, graceful,
and varied in their bendings, so that they may not appear stiff like
pieces of wood.C./--_That it is impossible for any Memory to retain the Aspects
and Changes of the Members._


/It/ is impossible that any memory can be able to retain all the
aspects or motions of any member of any animal whatever.This case
we shall exemplify by the appearance of the hand.And because any
continued quantity is divisible _ad infinitum_, the motion of the eye
which looks at the hand, and moves from A to B, moves by a space A B,
which is also a continued quantity, and consequently divisible _ad
infinitum_, and in every part of the motion varies to its view the
aspect and figure of the hand; and so it will do if it move round the
whole circle.The same will the hand do which is raised in its motion,
that is, it will pass over a space, which is a continued quantity[24].[Illustration]




/Chap.CI./--_The Motions of Figures._


/Never/ put the head straight upon the shoulders, but a little turned
sideways to the right or left, even though the figures should be
looking up or down, or straight, because it is necessary to give them
some motion of life and spirit.Nor ever compose a figure in such
a manner, either in a front or back view, as that every part falls
straight upon another from the top to the bottom.But if you wish to
introduce such a figure, use it for old age.Never repeat the same
motion of arms, or of legs, not only not in the same figure, but in
those which are standing by, or near; if the necessity of the case,
or the expression of the subject you represent, do not oblige you to
it[25].CII./--_Of common Motions._


/The/ variety of motions in man are equal to the variety of accidents
or thoughts affecting the mind, and each of these thoughts, or
accidents, will operate more or less, according to the temper and age
of the subject; for the same cause will in the actions of youth, or of
old age, produce very different effects.CIII./--_Of simple Motions._


/Simple/ motion is that which a man performs in merely bending
backwards or forwards.CIV./--_Complex Motion._


/Complex/ motion is that which, to produce some particular action,
requires the body to bend downwards and sideways at the same time.The
painter must be careful in his compositions to apply these complex
motions according to the nature of the subject, and not to weaken or
destroy the effect of it by introducing figures with simple motions,
without any connexion with the subject.CV./--_Motions appropriated to the Subject._


/The/ motions of your figures are to be expressive of the quantity of
strength requisite to the force of the action.Let not the same effort
be used to take up a stick as would easily raise a piece of timber.Therefore shew great variety in the expression of strength, according
to the quality of the load to be managed.CVI./--_Appropriate Motions._


/There/ are some emotions of the mind which are not expressed by any
particular motion of the body, while in others, the expression cannot
be shewn without it.In the first, the arms fall down, the hands and
all the other parts, which in general are the most active, remain at
rest.But such emotions of the soul as produce bodily action, must put
the members into such motions as are appropriated to the intention of
the mind.This, however, is an ample subject, and we have a great deal
to say upon it.There is a third kind of motion, which participates
of the two already described; and a fourth, which depends neither on
the one nor the other.This last belongs to insensibility, or fury,
and should be ranked with madness or stupidity; and so adapted only to
grotesque or Moresco work.CVII./--_Of the Postures of Women and young People._


/It/ is not becoming in women and young people to have their legs
too much asunder, because it denotes boldness; while the legs close
together shew modesty.CVIII./--_Of the Postures of Children._


/Children/ and old people are not to express quick motions, in what
concerns their legs.CIX./--_Of the Motion of the Members._


/Let/ every member be employed in performing its proper functions.For
instance, in a dead body, or one asleep, no member should appear alive
or awake.A foot bearing the weight of the whole body, should not be
playing its toes up and down, but flat upon the ground; except when it
rests entirely upon the heel.CX./--_Of mental Motions._


/A mere/ thought, or operation of the mind, excites only simple and
easy motions of the body; not this way, and that way, because its
object is in the mind, which does not affect the senses when it is
collected within itself.CXI./--_Effect of the Mind upon the Motions of the Body,
occasioned by some outward Object._


/When/ the motion is produced by the presence of some object, either
the cause is immediate or not.If it be immediate, the figure will
first turn towards it the organs most necessary, the eyes; leaving its
feet in the same place; and will only move the thighs, hips, and knees
a little towards the same side, to which the eyes are directed.CXII./--_Of those who apply themselves to the Practice, without
having learnt the Theory of the Art._


/Those/ who become enamoured of the practice of the art, without having
previously applied to the diligent study of the scientific part of it,
may be compared to mariners, who put to sea in a ship without rudder or
compass, and therefore cannot be certain of arriving at the wished-for
port.Practice must always be founded on good theory; to this, Perspective is
the guide and entrance, without which nothing can be well done.CXIII./--_Precepts in Painting._


/Perspective/ is to Painting what the bridle is to a horse, and the
rudder to a ship.The size of a figure should denote the distance at which it is situated.If a figure be seen of the natural size, remember that it denotes its
being near to the eye.CXIV./--_Of the Boundaries of Objects called Outlines or
Contours._


/The/ outlines or contours of bodies are so little perceivable, that
at any small distance between that and the object, the eye will not be
able to recognise the features of a friend or relation, if it were not
for their clothes and general appearance.So that by the knowledge of
the whole it comes to know the parts.CXV./--_Of linear Perspective._


/Linear/ Perspective consists in giving, by established rules, the true
dimensions of objects, according to their respective distances; so that
the second object be less than the first, the third than the second,
and by degrees at last they become invisible.I find by experience,
that, if the second object be at the same distance from the first, as
the first is from the eye, though they be of the same size, the second
will appear half the size of the first; and, if the third be at the
same distance behind the second, it will diminish two thirds; and so
on, by degrees, they will, at equal distances, diminish in proportion;
provided that the interval be not more than twenty cubits[26]; at
which distance it will lose two fourths of its size: at forty it will
diminish three fourths; and at sixty it will lose five sixths, and so
on progressively.But you must be distant from your picture twice the
size of it; for, if you be only once the size, it will make a great
difference in the measure from the first to the second.CXVI./--_What Parts of Objects disappear first by Distance._


/Those/ parts which are of less magnitude will first vanish from the
sight[27].This happens, because the shape of small objects, at an
equal distance, comes to the eye under a more acute angle than the
large ones, and the perception of them is less, in proportion as they
are less in magnitude.It follows then, that if the large objects, by
being removed to a great distance, and consequently coming to the eye
by a small angle, are almost lost to the sight, the small objects will
entirely disappear.CXVII./--_Of remote Objects._


/The/ outlines of objects will be less seen, in proportion as they are
more distant from the eye.CXVIII./--_Of the Point of Sight._


/The/ point of sight must be on a level with the eyes of a common-sized
man, and placed upon the horizon, which is the line formed by a flat
country terminating with the sky.An exception must be made as to
mountains, which are above that line.CXIX./--_A Picture is to be viewed from one Point only._


/This/ will be proved by one single example.If you mean to represent
a round ball very high up, on a flat and perpendicular wall, it will
be necessary to make it oblong, like the shape of an egg, and to place
yourself (that is, the eye, or point of view) so far back, as that its
outline or circumference may appear round.CXX./--_Of the Dimensions of the first Figure in an historical
Painting._


/The/ first figure in your picture will be less than Nature, in
proportion as it recedes from the front of the picture, or the bottom
line; and by the same rule the others behind it will go on lessening in
an equal degree[28].CXXI./--_Of Objects that are lost to the Sight in Proportion to
their Distance._


/The/ first things that disappear, by being removed to some distance,
are the outlines or boundaries of objects.The second, as they remove
farther, are the shadows which divide contiguous bodies.The third
are the thickness of legs and feet; and so in succession the small
parts are lost to the sight, till nothing remains but a confused mass,
without any distinct parts.CXXII./--_Errors not so easily seen in small Objects as in large
ones._


/Supposing/ this small object to represent a man, or any other animal,
although the parts, by being so much diminished or reduced, cannot be
executed with the same exactness of proportion, nor finished with the
same accuracy, as if on a larger scale, yet on that very account the
faults will be less conspicuous.For example, if you look at a man at
the distance of two hundred yards, and with all due attention mean to
form a judgment, whether he be handsome or ugly, deformed or well made,
you will find that, with all your endeavours, you can hardly venture
to decide.The reason is, that the man diminishes so much by the
distance, that it is impossible to distinguish the parts minutely.If
you wish to know by demonstration the diminution of the above figure,
hold your finger up before your eye at about nine inches distance, so
that the top of your finger corresponds with the top of the head of
the distant figure: you will perceive that your finger covers, not
only its head, but part of its body; which is an evident proof of the
apparent diminution of that object.Hence it often happens, that we are
doubtful, and can scarcely, at some distance, distinguish the form of
even a friend.CXXIII./--_Historical Subjects one above another on the same
Wall to be avoided._


/This/ custom, which has been generally adopted by painters, on the
front and sides of chapels, is much to be condemned.They begin with an
historical picture, its landscape and buildings, in one compartment.After which, they raise another compartment, and execute another
history with other buildings upon another level; and from thence they
proceed to a third and fourth, varying the point of sight, as if the
beholder was going up steps, while, in fact, he must look at them all
from below, which is very ill judged in those matters.We know that the point of sight is the eye of the spectator; and if
you ask, how is a series of subjects, such as the life of a saint, to
be represented, in different compartments on the same wall?I answer,
that you are to place the principal event in the largest compartment,
and make the point of sight as high as the eye of the spectator.Begin
that subject with large figures; and as you go up, lessen the objects,
as well the figures, as buildings, varying the plans according to the
effect of perspective; but never varying the point of sight: and so
complete the series of subjects, till you come to a certain height,
where terrestrial objects can be seen no more, except the tops of
trees, or clouds and birds; or if you introduce figures, they must be
aerial, such as angels, or saints in glory, or the like, if they suit
the purpose of your history.If not, do not undertake this kind of
painting, for your work will be faulty, and justly reprehensible[29].CXXIV./--_Why Objects in Painting can never detach, as natural
Objects do._


/Painters/ often despair of being able to imitate Nature, from
observing, that their pictures have not the same relief, nor the same
life, as natural objects have in a looking-glass, though they both
appear upon a plain surface.They say, they have colours which surpass
in brightness the quality of the lights, and in darkness the quality of
the shades of the objects seen in the looking-glass; but attribute this
circumstance to their own ignorance, and not to the true cause, because
they do not know it.It is impossible that objects in painting should
appear with the same relief as those in the looking-glass, unless we
look at them with only one eye.The two eyes A B looking at objects one behind
another, as M and N, see them both; because M cannot entirely occupy
the space of N, by reason that the base of the visual rays is so broad,
that the second object is seen behind the first.But if one eye be
shut, and you look with the other S, the body F will entirely cover
the body R, because the visual rays beginning at one point, form a
triangle, of which the body F is the base, and being prolonged, they
form two diverging tangents at the two extremities of F, which cannot
touch the body R behind it, therefore can never see it[30].[Illustration]




/Chap.CXXV./--_How to give the proper Dimension to Objects in
Painting._


[Illustration]

/In/ order to give the appearance of the natural size, if the piece
be small (as miniatures), the figures on the fore-ground are to be
finished with as much precision as those of any large painting, because
being small they are to be brought up close to the eye.But large
paintings are seen at some distance; whence it happens, that though
the figures in each are so different in size, in appearance they will
be the same.This proceeds from the eye receiving those objects under
the same angle; and it is proved thus.Let the large painting be B C,
the eye A, and D E a pane of glass, through which are seen the figures
situated at B C. I say that the eye being fixed, the figures in the
copy of the paintings B C are to be smaller, in proportion as the glass
D E is nearer the eye A, and are to be as precise and finished.But if
you will execute the picture B C upon the glass D E, this ought to be
less finished than the picture B C, and more so than the figure M N
transferred upon the glass F G; because, supposing the figure P O to
be as much finished as the natural one in B C, the perspective of O P
would be false, since, though in regard to the diminution of the figure
it would be right, B C being diminished in P O, the finishing would not
agree with the distance, because in giving it the perfection of the
natural B C, B C would appear as near as O P; but, if you search for
the diminution of O P, O P will be found at the distance B C, and the
diminution of the finishing as at F G.CXXVI./--_How to draw accurately any particular Spot._


/Take/ a glass as large as your paper, fasten it well between your eye
and the object you mean to draw, and fixing your head in a frame (in
such a manner as not to be able to move it) at the distance of two
feet from the glass; shut one eye, and draw with a pencil accurately
upon the glass all that you see through it.After that, trace upon
paper what you have drawn on the glass, which tracing you may paint at
pleasure, observing the aerial perspective.CXXVII./--_Disproportion to be avoided, even in the accessory
Parts._


/A great/ fault is committed by many painters, which is highly to be
blamed, that is, to represent the habitations of men, and other parts
of their compositions, so low, that the doors do not reach as high as
the knees of their inhabitants, though, according to their situation,
they are nearer to the eye of the spectator, than the men who seem
willing to enter them.I have seen some pictures with porticos,
supported by columns loaded with figures; one grasping a column against
which it leans, as if it were a walking-stick, and other similar
errors, which are to be avoided with the greatest care.INVENTION, /or/ COMPOSITION.CXXVIII./--_Precept for avoiding a bad Choice in the Style or
Proportion of Figures._


/The/ painter ought to form his style upon the most proportionate
model in Nature; and after having measured that, he ought to measure
himself also, and be perfectly acquainted with his own defects or
deficiencies; and having acquired this knowledge, his constant care
should be to avoid conveying into his work those defects which he has
found in his own person; for these defects, becoming habitual to his
observation, mislead his judgment, and he perceives them no longer.We
ought, therefore, to struggle against such a prejudice, which grows
up with us; for the mind, being fond of its own habitation, is apt to
represent it to our imagination as beautiful.From the same motive it
may be, that there is not a woman, however plain in her person, who may
not find her admirer, if she be not a monster.Against this bent of the
mind you ought very cautiously to be on your guard.CXXIX./--_Variety in Figures._


/A painter/ ought to aim at universal excellence; for he will be
greatly wanting in dignity, if he do one thing well and another badly,
as many do, who study only the naked figure, measured and proportioned
by a pair of compasses in their hands, and do not seek for variety.A
man may be well proportioned, and yet be tall or short, large or lean,
or of a middle size; and whoever does not make great use of these
varieties, which are all existing in Nature in its most perfect state,
will produce figures as if cast in one and the same mould, which is
highly reprehensible.CXXX./--_How a Painter ought to proceed in his Studies._


/The/ painter ought always to form in his mind a kind of system of
reasoning or discussion within himself on any remarkable object
before him.He should stop, take notes, and form some rule upon it;
considering the place, the circumstances, the lights and shadows.CXXXI./--_Of sketching Histories and Figures._


/Sketches/ of historical subjects must be slight, attending only to the
situation of the figures, without regard to the finishing of particular
members, which may be done afterwards at leisure, when the mind is so
disposed.CXXXII./--_How to study Composition._


/The/ young student should begin by sketching slightly some single
figure, and turn that on all sides, knowing already how to contract,
and how to extend the members; after which, he may put two together in
various attitudes, we will suppose in the act of fighting boldly.This
composition also he must try on all sides, and in a variety of ways,
tending to the same expression.Then he may imagine one of them very
courageous, while the other is a coward.Let these attitudes, and many
other accidental affections of the mind, be with great care studied,
examined, and dwelt upon.CXXXIII./--_Of the Attitudes of Men._


/The/ attitudes and all the members are to be disposed in such
a manner, that by them the intentions of the mind may be easily
discovered.CXXXIV./--_Variety of Positions._


/The/ positions of the human figure are to be adapted to the age and
rank; and to be varied according to the difference of the sexes, men or
women.CXXXV./--_Of Studies from Nature for History._


/It/ is necessary to consider well the situation for which the history
is to be painted, particularly the height; and let the painter place
accordingly the model, from which he means to make his studies for that
historical picture; and set himself as much below the object, as the
picture is to be above the eye of the spectator, otherwise the work
will be faulty.CXXXVI./--_Of the Variety of Figures in History Painting._


/History/ painting must exhibit variety in its fullest extent.In
temper, size, complexion, actions, plumpness, leanness, thick, thin,
large, small, rough, smooth, old age and youth, strong and muscular,
weak, with little appearance of muscles, cheerfulness and melancholy.Some should be with curled hair, and some with straight; some short,
some long, some quick in their motions, and some slow, with a variety
of dresses and colours, according as the subject may require.CXXXVII./--_Of Variety in History._


/A painter/ should delight in introducing great variety into his
compositions, avoiding repetition, that by this fertility of invention
he may attract and charm the eye of the beholder.If it be requisite
according to the subject meant to be represented, that there should be
a mixture of men differing in their faces, ages, and dress, grouped
with women, children, dogs, and horses, buildings, hills and flat
country; observe dignity and decorum in the principal figure; such
as a king, magistrate, or philosopher, separating them from the low
classes of the people.Mix not afflicted or weeping figures with joyful
and laughing ones; for Nature dictates that the cheerful be attended
by others of the same disposition of mind.Laughter is productive of
laughter, and _vice versa_.CXXXVIII./--_Of the Age of Figures._


/Do/ not bring together a number of boys with as many old men, nor
young men with infants, nor women with men; if the subject you mean to
represent does not oblige you to it.CXXXIX./--_Of Variety of Faces._


/The/ Italian painters have been accused of a common fault, that is,
of introducing into their compositions the faces, and even the whole
figures, of Roman emperors, which they take from the antique.To
avoid such an error, let no repetition take place, either in parts,
or the whole of a figure; nor let there be even the same face in
another composition: and the more the figures are contrasted, viz.the
deformed opposed to the beautiful, the old to the young, the strong
to the feeble, the more the picture will please and be admired.These
different characters, contrasted with each other, will increase the
beauty of the whole.It frequently happens that a painter, while he is composing, will use
any little sketch or scrap of drawing he has by him, and endeavour to
make it serve his purpose; but this is extremely injudicious, because
he may very often find that the members he has drawn have not the
motion suited to what he means to express; and after he has adopted,
accurately drawn, and even well finished them, he will be loth to rub
out and change them for others.CXL./--_A Fault in Painters._


/It/ is a very great fault in a painter to repeat the same motions in
figures, and the same folds in draperies in the same composition, as
also to make all the faces alike.CXLI./--_How you may learn to compose Groups for History
Painting._


/When/ you are well instructed in perspective, and know perfectly how
to draw the anatomy and forms of different bodies or objects, it should
be your delight to observe and consider in your walks the different
actions of men, when they are talking, or quarrelling; when they laugh,
and when they fight.Attend to their positions, and to those of the
spectators; whether they are attempting to separate those who fight,
or merely lookers-on.Be quick in sketching these with slight strokes
in your pocket-book, which should always be about you, and made of
stained paper, as you ought not to rub out.When it is full, take
another, for these are not things to be rubbed out, but kept with the
greatest care; because forms and motions of bodies are so infinitely
various, that the memory is not able to retain them; therefore preserve
these sketches as your assistants and masters.CXLII./--_How to study the Motions of the human Body._


/The/ first requisite towards a perfect acquaintance with the various
motions of the human body, is the knowledge of all the parts,
particularly the joints, in all the attitudes in which it may be
placed.Then make slight sketches in your pocket-book, as opportunities
occur, of the actions of men, as they happen to meet your eye, without
being perceived by them; because, if they were to observe you, they
would be disturbed from that freedom of action, which is prompted by
inward feeling; as when two men are quarrelling and angry, each of
them seeming to be in the right, and with great vehemence move their
eyebrows, arms, and all the other members, using motions appropriated
to their words and feelings.This they could not do, if you wanted them
to imitate anger, or any other accidental emotion; such as laughter,
weeping, pain, admiration, fear, and the like.For that reason, take
care never to be without a little book, for the purpose of sketching
those various motions, and also groups of people standing by.This
will teach you how to compose history.Two things demand the principal
attention of a good painter.One is the exact outline and shape of the
figure; the other, the true expression of what passes in the mind of
that figure, which he must feel, and that is very important.CXLIII./--_Of Dresses, and of Draperies and Folds._


/The/ draperies with which you dress figures ought to have their
folds so accommodated as to surround the parts they are intended to
cover; that in the mass of light there be not any dark fold, and in
the mass of shadows none receiving too great a light.They must go
gently over, describing the parts; but not with lines across, cutting
the members with hard notches, deeper than the part can possibly
be; at the same time, it must fit the body, and not appear like an
empty bundle of cloth; a fault of many painters, who, enamoured of
the quantity and variety of folds, have encumbered their figures,
forgetting the intention of clothes, which is to dress and surround the
parts gracefully wherever they touch; and not to be filled with wind,
like bladders, puffed up where the parts project.I do not deny that
we ought not to neglect introducing some handsome folds among these
draperies, but it must be done with great judgment, and suited to the
parts, where, by the actions of the limbs and position of the whole
body, they gather together.Above all, be careful to vary the quality
and quantity of your folds in compositions of many figures; so that,
if some have large folds, produced by thick woollen cloth; others,
being dressed in thinner stuff, may have them narrower; some sharp and
straight, others soft and undulating.CXLIV./--_Of the Nature of Folds in Draperies._


/Many/ painters prefer making the folds of their draperies with acute
angles, deep and precise; others with angles hardly perceptible; and
some with none at all; but instead of them, certain curved lines.CXLV./--_How the Folds of Draperies ought to be represented_,
Plate XVIII./That/ part of the drapery, which is the farthest from the place where
it is gathered, will appear more approaching its natural state.Every
thing naturally inclines to preserve its primitive form.Therefore a
stuff or cloth, which is of equal thickness on both sides, will always
incline to remain flat.For that reason, when it is constrained by some
fold to relinquish its flat situation, it is observed that, at the part
of its greatest restraint, it is continually making efforts to return
to its natural shape; and the parts most distant from it reassume more
of their primitive state by ample and distended folds.For example, let
A B C be the drapery mentioned above; A B the place where it is folded
or restrained.I have said that the part, which is farthest from the
place of its restraint, would return more towards its primitive shape.Therefore C being the farthest, will be broader and more extended than
any other part._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

/Chap.CXLVI./--_How the Folds in Draperies ought to be made._


/Draperies/ are not to be encumbered with many folds: on the contrary,
there ought to be some only where they are held up with the hands or
arms of the figures, and the rest left to fall with natural simplicity.They ought to be studied from Nature; that is to say, if a woollen
cloth be intended, the folds ought to be drawn after such cloth; if it
be of silk, or thin stuff, or else very thick for labourers, let it
be distinguished by the nature of the folds.But never copy them, as
some do, after models dressed in paper, or thin leather, for it greatly
misleads.CXLVII./--_Fore-shortening of Folds_, Plate XIX./Where/ the figure is fore-shortened, there ought to appear a greater
number of folds, than on the other parts, all surrounding it in a
circular manner.M N will have the
middle of every circular fold successively removed farther from its
outline, in proportion as it is more distant from the eye.In M O of
the other figure the outlines of these circular folds will appear
almost straight, because it is situated opposite the eye; but in P and
Q quite the contrary, as in N and M.CXLVIII./--_Of Folds._


/The/ folds of draperies, whatever be the motion of the figure, ought
always to shew, by the form of their outlines, the attitude of such
figure; so as to leave, in the mind of the beholder, no doubt or
confusion in regard to the true position of the body; and let there be
no fold, which, by its shadow, breaks through any of the members; that
is to say, appearing to go in deeper than the surface of the part it
covers.And if you represent the figure clothed with several garments,
one over the other, let it not appear as if the upper one covered only
a mere skeleton; but let it express that it is also well furnished with
flesh, and a thickness of folds, suitable to the number of its under
garments.The folds surrounding the members ought to diminish in thickness near
the extremities of the part they surround.The length of the folds, which are close to the members, ought to
produce other folds on that side where the member is diminished by
fore-shortening, and be more extended on the opposite side.CXLIX./--_Of Decorum._


/Observe/ decorum in every thing you represent, that is, fitness of
action, dress, and situation, according to the dignity or meanness of
the subject to be represented.Be careful that a king, for instance,
be grave and majestic in his countenance and dress; that the place be
well decorated; and that his attendants, or the by-standers, express
reverence and admiration, and appear as noble, in dresses suitable to a
royal court.On the contrary, in the representation of a mean subject, let the
figures appear low and despicable; those about them with similar
countenances, and actions, denoting base and presumptuous minds, and
meanly clad.In short, in both cases, the parts must correspond with
the general sentiment of the composition.The motions of old age should not be similar to those of youth; those
of a woman to those of a man; nor should the latter be the same as
those of a boy.CL./--_The Character of Figures in Composition._


/In/ general, the painter ought to introduce very few old men, in the
ordinary course of historical subjects, and those few separated from
young people; because old people are few, and their habits do not agree
with those of youth.Where there is no conformity of custom, there can
be no intimacy, and, without it, a company is soon separated.But if
the subject require an appearance of gravity, a meeting on important
business, as a council, for instance, let there be few young men
introduced, for youth willingly avoids such meetings.CLI./--_The Motion of the Muscles, when the Figures are in
natural Positions._


/A figure/, which does not express by its position the sentiments and
passions, by which we suppose it animated, will appear to indicate
that its muscles are not obedient to its will, and the painter very
deficient in judgment.For that reason, a figure is to shew great
eagerness and meaning; and its position is to be so well appropriated
to that meaning, that it cannot be mistaken, nor made use of for any
other.CLII./--_A Precept in Painting._


/The/ painter ought to notice those quick motions, which men are apt to
make without thinking, when impelled by strong and powerful affections
of the mind.He ought to take memorandums of them, and sketch them in
his pocket-book, in order to make use of them when they may answer his
purpose; and then to put a living model in the same position, to see
the quality and aspect of the muscles which are in action.CLIII./--_Of the Motion of Man_, Plates XX./The/ first and principal part of the art is composition of any sort,
or putting things together.The second relates to the expression and
motion of the figures, and requires that they be well appropriated,
and seeming attentive to what they are about; appearing to move with
alacrity and spirit, according to the degree of expression suitable
to the occasion; expressing slow and tardy motions, as well as those
of eagerness in pursuit: and that quickness and ferocity be expressed
with such force as to give an idea of the sensations of the actors.When a figure is to throw a dart, stones, or the like, let it be
seen evidently by the attitude and disposition of all the members,
that such is its intention; of which there are two examples in the
opposite plates, varied both in action and power.The first in point
of vigour is A. The second is B. But A will throw his weapon farther
than B, because, though they seem desirous of throwing it to the same
point, A having turned his feet towards the object, while his body is
twisted and bent back the contrary way, to increase his power, returns
with more velocity and force to the point to which he means to throw.But the figure B having turned his feet the same way as his body,
it returns to its place with great inconvenience, and consequently
with weakened powers.For in the expression of great efforts, the
preparatory motions of the body must be strong and violent, twisting
and bending, so that it may return with convenient ease, and by that
means have a great effect.In the same manner, if a cross-bow be not
strung with force, the motion of whatever it shoots will be short and
without effect; because, where there is no impulse, there can be no
motion; and if the impulse be not violent, the motion is but tardy
and feeble.So a bow, which is not strong, has no motion; and, if it
be strung, it will remain in that state till the impulse be given
by another power which puts it in motion, and it will shoot with a
violence equal to that which was employed in bending it.In the same
manner, the man who does not twist and bend his body will have acquired
no power.Therefore, after A has thrown his dart, he will find himself
twisted the contrary way, viz.on the side where he has thrown; and
he will have acquired only power sufficient to serve him to return to
where he was at first._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]

/Chap.CLIV./--_Of Attitudes, and the Motions of the Members._


/The/ same attitude is not to be repeated in the same picture, nor the
same motion of members in the same figure, nay, not even in the hands
or fingers.And if the history requires a great number of figures, such
as a battle, or a massacre of soldiers, in which there are but three
ways of striking, viz.thrusting, cutting, or back-handed; in that
case you must take care, that all those who are cutting be expressed
in different views; some turning their backs, some their sides, and
others be seen in front; varying in the same manner the three different
ways of fighting, so that all the actions may have a relation to those
three principles.In battles, complex motions display great art, giving
spirit and animation to the whole.By complex motion is meant, for
instance, that of a single figure shewing the front of the legs, and at
the same time the profile of the shoulder.But of this I shall treat in
another place[31].CLV./--_Of a single Figure separate from an historical Group._


/The/ same motion of members should not be repeated in a figure which
you mean to be alone; for instance, if the figure be represented
running, it must not throw both hands forward; but one forward and the
other backward, or else it cannot run.If the right foot come forward,
the right arm must go backward and the left forward, because, without
such disposition and contraste of parts, it is impossible to run well.If another figure be supposed to follow this, one of its legs should
be brought somewhat forward, and the other be perpendicular under the
head; the arm on the same side should pass forward.But of this we
shall treat more fully in the book on motion[32].CLVI./--_On the Attitudes of the human Figure._


/A painter/ is to be attentive to the motions and actions of men,
occasioned by some sudden accident.He must observe them on the spot,
take sketches, and not wait till he wants such expression, and then
have it counterfeited for him; for instance, setting a model to weep
when there is no cause; such an expression without a cause will be
neither quick nor natural.But it will be of great use to have observed
every action from nature, as it occurs, and then to have a model set in
the same attitude to help the recollection, and find out something to
the purpose, according to the subject in hand.CLVII./--_How to represent a Storm._


/To/ form a just idea of a storm, you must consider it attentively in
its effects.When the wind blows violently over the sea or land, it
removes and carries off with it every thing that is not firmly fixed
to the general mass.The clouds must appear straggling and broken,
carried according to the direction and the force of the wind, and
blended with clouds of dust raised from the sandy shore.Branches and
leaves of trees must be represented as carried along by the violence
of the storm, and, together with numberless other light substances,
scattered in the air.Trees and grass must be bent to the ground, as if
yielding to the course of the wind.Boughs must be twisted out of their
natural form, with their leaves reversed and entangled.Of the figures
dispersed in the picture, some should appear thrown on the ground, so
wrapped up in their cloaks and covered with dust, as to be scarcely
distinguishable.Of those who remain on their feet, some should be
sheltered by and holding fast behind some great trees, to avoid the
same fate: others bending to the ground, their hands over their faces
to ward off the dust; their hair and their clothes flying straight up
at the mercy of the wind.The high tremendous waves of the stormy sea will be covered with
foaming froth; the most subtle parts of which, being raised by the
wind, like a thick mist, mix with the air.What vessels are seen should
appear with broken cordage, and torn sails, fluttering in the wind;
some with broken masts fallen across the hulk, already on its side
amidst the tempestuous waves.Some of the crew should be represented as
if crying aloud for help, and clinging to the remains of the shattered
vessel.Let the clouds appear as driven by tempestuous winds against
the summits of lofty mountains, enveloping those mountains, and
breaking and recoiling with redoubled force, like waves against a rocky
shore.The air should be rendered awfully dark, by the mist, dust, and
thick clouds.CLVIII./--_How to compose a Battle._


/First/, let the air exhibit a confused mixture of smoke, arising from
the discharge of artillery and musquetry, and the dust raised by the
horses of the combatants; and observe, that dust being of an earthy
nature, is heavy; but yet, by reason of its minute particles, it is
easily impelled upwards, and mixes with the air; nevertheless, it
naturally falls downwards again, the most subtle parts of it alone
gaining any considerable degree of elevation, and at its utmost height
it is so thin and transparent, as to appear nearly of the colour of
the air.The smoke, thus mixing with the dusty air, forms a kind of
dark cloud, at the top of which it is distinguished from the dust by a
blueish cast, the dust retaining more of its natural colour.On that
part from which the light proceeds, this mixture of air, smoke, and
dust, will appear much brighter than on the opposite side.The more the
combatants are involved in this turbulent mist, the less distinctly
they will be seen, and the more confused will they be in their lights
and shades.Let the faces of the musketeers, their bodies, and every
object near them, be tinged with a reddish hue, even the air or cloud
of dust; in short, all that surrounds them.This red tinge you will
diminish, in proportion to their distance, from the primary cause.The
groups of figures, which appear at a distance between the spectator
and the light, will form a dark mass upon a light ground; and their
legs will be more undetermined and lost as they approach nearer to the
ground; because there the dust is heavier and thicker.If you mean to represent some straggling horses, running out of the
main body, introduce also some small clouds of dust, as far distant
from each other as the leap of the horse, and these little clouds will
become fainter, more scanty, and diffused, in proportion to their
distance from the horse.That nearest to his feet will consequently be
the most determined, smallest, and the thickest of all.Let the air be full of arrows, in all directions; some ascending, some
falling down, and some darting straight forwards.The bullets of the
musketry, though not seen, will be marked in their course by a train
of smoke, which breaks through the general confusion.The figures in
the fore-ground should have their hair covered with dust, as also their
eyebrows, and all parts liable to receive it.The victorious party will be running forwards, their hair and other
light parts flying in the wind, their eyebrows lowered, and the motion
of every member properly contrasted; for instance, in moving the right
foot forwards, the left arm must be brought forwards also.If you make
any of them fallen down, mark the trace of his fall on the slippery,
gore-stained dust; and where the ground is less impregnated with blood,
let the print of men's feet and of horses, that have passed that
way, be marked.Let there be some horses dragging the bodies of their
riders, and leaving behind them a furrow, made by the body thus trailed
along.The countenances of the vanquished will appear pale and dejected.Their
eyebrows raised, and much wrinkled about the forehead and cheeks.The tip of their noses somewhat divided from the nostrils by arched
wrinkles terminating at the corner of the eyes, those wrinkles being
occasioned by the opening and raising of the nostrils; the upper
lips turned up, discovering the teeth.Their mouths wide open, and
expressive of violent lamentation.One may be seen fallen wounded
on the ground, endeavouring with one hand to support his body, and
covering his eyes with the other, the palm of which is turned towards
the enemy.Others running away, and with open mouths seeming to cry
aloud.Between the legs of the combatants let the ground be strewed
with all sorts of arms; as broken shields, spears, swords, and the
like.Many dead bodies should be introduced, some entirely covered
with dust, others in part only; let the blood, which seems to issue
immediately from the wound, appear of its natural colour, and running
in a winding course, till, mixing with the dust, it forms a reddish
kind of mud.Some should be in the agonies of death; their teeth shut,
their eyes wildly staring, their fists clenched, and their legs in a
distorted position.Some may appear disarmed, and beaten down by the
enemy, still fighting with their fists and teeth, and endeavouring
to take a passionate, though unavailing revenge.There may be also a
straggling horse without a rider, running in wild disorder; his mane
flying in the wind, beating down with his feet all before him, and
doing a deal of damage.A wounded soldier may also be seen falling to
the ground, and attempting to cover himself with his shield, while an
enemy bending over him endeavours to give him the finishing stroke.Several dead bodies should be heaped together under a dead horse.Some
of the conquerors, as having ceased fighting, may be wiping their faces
from the dirt, collected on them by the mixture of dust with the water
from their eyes.The _corps de reserve_ will be seen advancing gaily, but cautiously,
their eyebrows directed forwards, shading their eyes with their hands
to observe the motions of the enemy, amidst clouds of dust and smoke,
and seeming attentive to the orders of their chief.You may also make
their commander holding up his staff, pushing forwards, and pointing
towards the place where they are wanted.A river may likewise be
introduced, with horses fording it, dashing the water about between
their legs, and in the air, covering all the adjacent ground with water
and foam.Not a spot is to be left without some marks of blood and
carnage.CLIX./--_The Representation of an Orator and his Audience._


/If/ you have to represent a man who is speaking to a large assembly of
people, you are to consider the subject matter of his discourse, and
to adapt his attitude to such subject.If he means to persuade, let it
be known by his gesture.If he is giving an explanation, deduced from
several reasons, let him put two fingers of the right hand within one
of the left, having the other two bent close, his face turned towards
the audience, with the mouth half open, seeming to speak.If he is
sitting, let him appear as going to raise himself up a little, and his
head be forward.But if he is represented standing, let him bend his
chest and his head forward towards the people.The auditory are to appear silent and attentive, with their eyes upon
the speaker, in the act of admiration.There should be some old men,
with their mouths close shut, in token of approbation, and their lips
pressed together, so as to form wrinkles at the corners of the mouth,
and about the cheeks, and forming others about the forehead, by raising
the eyebrows, as if struck with astonishment.Some others of those
sitting by, should be seated with their hands within each other, round
one of their knees; some with one knee upon the other, and upon that,
one hand receiving the elbow, the other supporting the chin, covered
with a venerable beard.CLX./--_Of demonstrative Gestures._


/The/ action by which a figure points at any thing near, either in
regard to time or situation, is to be expressed by the hand very little
removed from the body.But if the same thing is far distant, the hand
must also be far removed from the body, and the face of the figure
pointing, must be turned towards those to whom he is pointing it out.CLXI./--_Of the Attitudes of the By-standers at some remarkable
Event._


/All/ those who are present at some event deserving notice, express
their admiration, but in various manners.As when the hand of justice
punishes some malefactor.If the subject be an act of devotion, the
eyes of all present should be directed towards the object of their
adoration, aided by a variety of pious actions with the other members;
as at the elevation of the host at mass, and other similar ceremonies.If it be a laughable subject, or one exciting compassion and moving to
tears, in those cases it will not be necessary for all to have their
eyes turned towards the object, but they will express their feelings
by different actions; and let there be several assembled in groups, to
rejoice or lament together.If the event be terrific, let the faces of
those who run away from the fight, be strongly expressive of fright,
with various motions; as shall be described in the tract on Motion.CLXII./--_How to represent Night._


/Those/ objects which are entirely deprived of light, are lost to the
sight, as in the night; therefore if you mean to paint a history under
those circumstances, you must suppose a large fire, and those objects
that are near it to be tinged with its colour, and the nearer they are
the more they will partake of it.The fire being red, all those objects
which receive light from it will appear of a reddish colour, and
those that are most distant from it will partake of the darkness that
surrounds them.The figures which are represented before the fire will
appear dark in proportion to the brightness of the fire, because those
parts of them which we see, are tinged by that darkness of the night,
and not by the light of the fire, which they intercept.Those that are
on either side of the fire, will be half in the shade of night, and
half in the red light.Those seen beyond the extent of the flames,
will be all of a reddish light upon a black ground.In regard to their
attitudes, let those who are nearest the fire, make screens of their
hands and cloaks, against the scorching heat, with their faces turned
on the contrary side, as if ready to run away from it.The most remote
will only be shading their eyes with their hands, as if hurt by the too
great glare.CLXIII./--_The Method of awakening the Mind to a Variety of
Inventions._


/I will/ not omit to introduce among these precepts a new kind of
speculative invention, which though apparently trifling, and almost
laughable, is nevertheless of great utility in assisting the genius to
find variety for composition.By looking attentively at old and smeared walls, or stones and veined
marble of various colours, you may fancy that you see in them several
compositions, landscapes, battles, figures in quick motion, strange
countenances, and dresses, with an infinity of other objects.By these
confused lines the inventive genius is excited to new exertions.CLXIV./--_Of Composition in History._


/When/ the painter has only a single figure to represent, he must avoid
any shortening whatever, as well of any particular member, as of the
whole figure, because he would have to contend with the prejudices of
those who have no knowledge in that branch of the art.But in subjects
of history, composed of many figures, shortenings may be introduced
with great propriety, nay, they are indispensable, and ought to be used
without reserve, as the subject may require; particularly in battles,
where of course many shortenings and contortions of figures happen,
amongst such an enraged multitude of actors, possessed, as it were, of
a brutal madness.EXPRESSION /and/ CHARACTER.CLXV./--_Of expressive Motions._


/Let/ your figures have actions appropriated to what they are intended
to think or say, and these will be well learnt by imitating the deaf,
who by the motion of their hands, eyes, eyebrows, and the whole body,
endeavour to express the sentiments of their mind.Do not ridicule the
thought of a master without a tongue teaching you an art he does not
understand; he will do it better by his expressive motions, than all
the rest by their words and examples.Let then the painter, of whatever
school, attend well to this maxim, and apply it to the different
qualities of the figures he represents, and to the nature of the
subject in which they are actors.CLXVI./--_How to paint Children._


/Children/ are to be represented with quick and contorted motions,
when they are sitting; but when standing, with fearful and timid
motions.CLXVII./--_How to represent old Men._


/Old/ men must have slow and heavy motions; their legs and knees must
be bent when they are standing, and their feet placed parallel and wide
asunder.Let them be bowed downwards, the head leaning much forward,
and their arms very little extended.CLXVIII./--_How to paint old Women._


/Old/ women, on the contrary, are to be represented bold and quick,
with passionate motions, like furies[33].But the motions are to appear
a great deal quicker in their arms than in their legs.CLXIX./--_How to paint Women._


/Women/ are to be represented in modest and reserved attitudes, with
their knees rather close, their arms drawing near each other, or folded
about the body; their heads looking downwards, and leaning a little on
one side.CLXX./--_Of the Variety of Faces._


/The/ countenances of your figures should be expressive of their
different situations: men at work, at rest, weeping, laughing, crying
out, in fear, or joy, and the like.The attitudes also, and all the
members, ought to correspond with the sentiment expressed in the faces.CLXXI./--_The Parts of the Face, and their Motions._


/The/ motions of the different parts of the face, occasioned by sudden
agitations of the mind, are many.The principal of these are, Laughter,
Weeping, Calling out, Singing, either in a high or low pitch,
Admiration, Anger, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Pain, and others, of which
I propose to treat.First, of Laughing and Weeping, which are very
similar in the motion of the mouth, the cheeks, the shutting of the
eyebrows, and the space between them; as we shall explain in its place,
in treating of the changes which happen in the face, hands, fingers,
and all the other parts of the body, as they are affected by the
different emotions of the soul; the knowledge of which is absolutely
necessary to a painter, or else his figures may be said to be twice
dead.But it is very necessary also that he be careful not to fall into
the contrary extreme; giving extraordinary motions to his figures, so
that in a quiet and peaceable subject, he does not seem to represent a
battle, or the revellings of drunken men: but, above all, the actors in
any point of history must be attentive to what they are about, or to
what is going forward; with actions that denote admiration, respect,
pain, suspicion, fear, and joy, according as the occasion, for which
they are brought together, may require.Endeavour that different points
of history be not placed one above the other on the same canvass, nor
walls with different horizons[34], as if it were a jeweller's shop,
shewing the goods in different square caskets.CLXXII./--_Laughing and Weeping._


/Between/ the expression of laughter and that of weeping there is no
difference in the motion of the features either in the eyes, mouth,
or cheeks; only in the ruffling of the brows, which is added when
weeping, but more elevated and extended in laughing.One may represent
the figure weeping as tearing his clothes, or some other expression,
as various as the cause of his feeling may be; because some weep
for anger, some through fear, others for tenderness and joy, or for
suspicion; some for real pain and torment; whilst others weep through
compassion, or regret at the loss of some friend and near relation.These different feelings will be expressed by some with marks of
despair, by others with moderation; some only shed tears, others cry
aloud, while another has his face turned towards heaven, with his
hand depressed, and his fingers twisted.Some again will be full of
apprehension, with their shoulders raised up to their ears, and so on,
according to the above causes.Those who weep, raise the brows, and bring them close together above
the nose, forming many wrinkles on the forehead, and the corners of the
mouth are turned downwards.Those who laugh have them turned upwards,
and the brows open and extended.CLXXIII./--_Of Anger._


/If/ you represent a man in a violent fit of anger, make him seize
another by the hair, holding his head writhed down against the ground,
with his knee fixed upon the ribs of his antagonist; his right arm up,
and his fist ready to strike; his hair standing on end, his eyebrows
low and straight; his teeth close, and seen at the corner of the mouth;
his neck swelled, and his body covered in the Abdomen with creases,
occasioned by his bending over his enemy, and the excess of his passion.CLXXIV./--_Despair._


/The/ last act of despondency is, when a man is in the act of putting a
period to his own existence.He should be represented with a knife in
one hand, with which he has already inflicted the wound, and tearing it
open with the other.He
will be standing with his feet asunder, his knees a little bent, and
his body leaning forward, as if ready to fall to the ground.CLXXV./--_The Course of Study to be pursued._


/The/ student who is desirous of making great proficiency in the art
of imitating the works of Nature, should not only learn the shape of
figures or other objects, and be able to delineate them with truth and
precision, but he must also accompany them with their proper lights and
shadows, according to the situation in which those objects appear.CLXXVI./--_Which of the two is the most useful Knowledge, the
Outlines of Figures, or that of Light and Shadow._


/The/ knowledge of the outline is of most consequence, and yet may be
acquired to great certainty by dint of study; as the outlines of the
different parts of the human figure, particularly those which do not
bend, are invariably the same.But the knowledge of the situation,
quality, and quantity of shadows, being infinite, requires the most
extensive study.CLXXVII./--_Which is the most important, the Shadows or Outlines
in Painting._


/It/ requires much more observation and study to arrive at perfection
in the shadowing of a picture, than in merely drawing the lines of it.The proof of this is, that the lines may be traced upon a veil or a
flat glass placed between the eye and the object to be imitated.But
that cannot be of any use in shadowing, on account of the infinite
gradation of shades, and the blending of them, which does not allow of
any precise termination; and most frequently they are confused, as will
be demonstrated in another place[35].CLXXVIII./--_What is a Painter's first Aim, and Object._


/The/ first object of a painter is to make a simple flat surface appear
like a relievo, and some of its parts detached from the ground; he
who excels all others in that part of the art, deserves the greatest
praise.This perfection of the art depends on the correct distribution
of lights and shades, called _Chiaro-scuro_.If the painter then avoids
shadows, he may be said to avoid the glory of the art, and to render
his work despicable to real connoisseurs, for the sake of acquiring the
esteem of vulgar and ignorant admirers of fine colours, who never have
any knowledge of relievo.CLXXIX./--_The Difference of Superficies, in regard to Painting._


/Solid/ bodies are of two sorts: the one has the surface curvilinear,
oval, or spherical; the other has several surfaces, or sides producing
angles, either regular or irregular.Spherical, or oval bodies, will
always appear detached from their ground, though they are exactly of
the same colour.Bodies also of different sides and angles will always
detach, because they are always disposed so as to produce shades on
some of their sides, which cannot happen to a plain superficies[36].CLXXX./--_How a Painter may become universal._


/The/ painter who wishes to be universal, and please a variety of
judges, must unite in the same composition, objects susceptible of
great force in the shadows, and great sweetness in the management of
them; accounting, however, in every instance, for such boldness and
softenings.CLXXXI./--_Accuracy ought to be learnt before Dispatch in the
Execution._


/If/ you wish to make good and useful studies, use great deliberation
in your drawings, observe well among the lights which, and how many,
hold the first rank in point of brightness; and so among the shadows,
which are darker than others, and in what manner they blend together;
compare the quality and quantity of one with the other, and observe
to what part they are directed.Be careful also in your outlines, or
divisions of the members.Remark well what quantity of parts are to be
on one side, and what on the other; and where they are more or less
apparent, or broad, or slender.Lastly, take care that the shadows and
lights be united, or lost in each other; without any hard strokes, or
lines: as smoke loses itself in the air, so are your lights and shadows
to pass from the one to the other, without any apparent separation.When you have acquired the habit, and formed your hand to accuracy,
quickness of execution will come of itself[37].CLXXXII./--_How the Painter is to place himself in regard to the
Light, and his Model._


/Let/ A B be the window, M the centre of it, C the model.The best
situation for the painter will be a little sideways, between the window
and his model, as D, so that he may see his object partly in the light
and partly in the shadow.[Illustration]




/Chap.CLXXXIII./--_Of the best Light._


/The/ light from on high, and not too powerful, will be found the best
calculated to shew the parts to advantage.CLXXXIV./--_Of Drawing by Candle-light._


/To/ this artificial light apply a paper blind, and you will see the
shadows undetermined and soft.CLXXXV./--_Of those Painters who draw at Home from one Light,
and afterwards adapt their Studies to another Situation in the Country,
and a different Light._


/It/ is a great error in some painters who draw a figure from Nature at
home, by any particular light, and afterwards make use of that drawing
in a picture representing an open country, which receives the general
light of the sky, where the surrounding air gives light on all sides.This painter would put dark shadows, where Nature would either produce
none, or, if any, so very faint as to be almost imperceptible; and he
would throw reflected lights where it is impossible there should be any.CLXXXVI./--_How high the Light should be in drawing from Nature._


/To/ paint well from Nature, your window should be to the North, that
the lights may not vary.If it be to the South, you must have paper
blinds, that the sun, in going round, may not alter the shadows.The
situation of the light should be such as to produce upon the ground a
shadow from your model as long as that is high.CLXXXVII./--_What Light the Painter must make use of to give
most Relief to his Figures._


/The/ figures which receive a particular light shew more relief than
those which receive an universal one; because the particular light
occasions some reflexes, which proceed from the light of one object
upon the shadows of another, and helps to detach it from the dark
ground.But a figure placed in front of a dark and large space, and
receiving a particular light, can receive no reflexion from any other
objects, and nothing is seen of the figure but what the light strikes
on, the rest being blended and lost in the darkness of the back ground.This is to be applied only to the imitation of night subjects with very
little light.CLXXXVIII./--_Advice to Painters._


/Be/ very careful, in painting, to observe, that between the shadows
there are other shadows, almost imperceptible, both for darkness and
shape; and this is proved by the third proposition[38], which says,
that the surfaces of globular or convex bodies have as great a variety
of lights and shadows as the bodies that surround them have.CLXXXIX./--_Of Shadows._


/Those/ shadows which in Nature are undetermined, and the extremities of
which can hardly be perceived, are to be copied in your painting in
the same manner, never to be precisely finished, but left confused and
blended.This apparent neglect will shew great judgment, and be the
ingenious result of your observation of Nature.CXC./--_Of the Kind of Light proper for drawing from Relievos,
or from Nature._


/Lights/ separated from the shadows with too much precision, have a
very bad effect.In order, therefore, to avoid this inconvenience,
if the object be in the open country, you need not let your figures
be illumined by the sun; but may suppose some transparent clouds
interposed, so that the sun not being visible, the termination of the
shadows will be also imperceptible and soft.CXCI./--_Whether the Light should be admitted in Front or
sideways; and which is most pleasing and graceful._


/The/ light admitted in front of heads situated opposite to side walls
that are dark, will cause them to have great relievo, particularly if
the light be placed high; and the reason is, that the most prominent
parts of those faces are illumined by the general light striking them
in front, which light produces very faint shadows on the part where it
strikes; but as it turns towards the sides, it begins to participate
of the dark shadows of the room, which grow darker in proportion as
it sinks into them.Besides, when the light comes from on high, it
does not strike on every part of the face alike, but one part produces
great shadows upon another; as the eyebrows, which deprive the whole
sockets of the eyes of light.The nose keeps it off from great part of
the mouth, and the chin from the neck, and such other parts.This, by
concentrating the light upon the most projecting parts, produces a very
great relief.CXCII./--_Of the Difference of Lights according to the
Situation._


/A small/ light will cast large and determined shadows upon the
surrounding bodies.A large light, on the contrary, will cast small
shadows on them, and they will be much confused in their termination.When a small but strong light is surrounded by a broad but weaker
light, the latter will appear like a demi-tint to the other, as the sky
round the sun.And the bodies which receive the light from the one,
will serve as demi-tints to those which receive the light from the
other.CXCIII./--_How to distribute the Light on Figures._


/The/ lights are to be distributed according to the natural situation
you mean your figures should occupy.If you suppose them in sunshine,
the shades must be dark, the lights broad and extended, and the shadows
of all the surrounding objects distinctly marked upon the ground.If
seen in a gloomy day, there will be very little difference between
the lights and shades, and no shadows at the feet.If the figures
be represented within doors, the lights and shadows will again be
distinctly divided, and produce shadows on the ground.But if you
suppose a paper blind at the window, and the walls painted white,
the effect will be the same as in a gloomy day, when the lights and
shadows have little difference.If the figures are enlightened by the
fire, the lights must be red and powerful, the shadows dark, and the
shadows upon the ground and upon the walls must be precise; observing
that they spread wider as they go off from the body.If the figures
be enlightened, partly by the sky and partly by the fire, that side
which receives the light from the sky will be the brightest, and on
the other side it will be reddish, somewhat of the colour of the fire.Above all, contrive, that your figures receive a broad light, and that
from above; particularly in portraits, because the people we see in the
street receive all the light from above; and it is curious to observe,
that there is not a face ever so well known amongst your acquaintance,
but would be recognised with difficulty, if it were enlightened from
beneath.CXCIV./--_Of the Beauty of Faces._


/You/ must not mark any muscles with hardness of line, but let the
soft light glide upon them, and terminate imperceptibly in delightful
shadows: from this will arise grace and beauty to the face.CXCV./--_How, in drawing a Face, to give it Grace, by the
Management of Light and Shade._


/A face/ placed in the dark part of a room, acquires great additional
grace by means of light and shadow.The shadowed part of the face
blends with the darkness of the ground, and the light part receives
an increase of brightness from the open air, the shadows on this side
becoming almost insensible; and from this augmentation of light and
shadow, the face has much relief, and acquires great beauty.CXCVI./--_How to give Grace and Relief to Faces._


/In/ streets running towards the west, when the sun is in the meridian,
and the walls on each side so high that they cast no reflexions on that
side of the bodies which is in shade, and the sky is not too bright,
we find the most advantageous situation for giving relief and grace to
figures, particularly to faces; because both sides of the face will
participate of the shadows of the walls.The sides of the nose and
the face towards the west, will be light, and the man whom we suppose
placed at the entrance, and in the middle of the street, will see all
the parts of that face, which are before him, perfectly illumined,
while both sides of it, towards the walls, will be in shadow.What
gives additional grace is, that these shades do not appear cutting,
hard, or dry, but softly blended and lost in each other.The reason of
it is, that the light which is spread all over in the air, strikes also
the pavement of the street, and reflecting upon the shady part of the
face, it tinges that slightly with the same hue: while the great light
which comes from above being confined by the tops of houses, strikes
on the face from different points, almost to the very beginning of
the shadows under the projecting parts of the face.It diminishes by
degrees the strength of them, increasing the light till it comes upon
the chin, where it terminates, and loses itself, blending softly into
the shades on all sides.For instance, if such light were A E, the line
F E would give light even to the bottom of the nose.The line C F will
give light only to the under lip; but the line A H would extend the
shadow to all the under parts of the face, and under the chin.In this situation the nose receives a very strong light from all the
points A B C D E.[Illustration]




/Chap.CXCVII./--_Of the Termination of Bodies upon each other._


/When/ a body, of a cylindrical or convex surface, terminates upon
another body of the same colour, it will appear darker on the edge,
than the body upon which it terminates.And any flat body, adjacent to
a white surface, will appear very dark; but upon a dark ground it will
appear lighter than any other part, though the lights be equal.CXCVIII./--_Of the Back-grounds of painted Objects._


/The/ ground which surrounds the figures in any painting, ought to
be darker than the light part of those figures, and lighter than the
shadowed part.CXCIX./--_How to detach and bring forward Figures out of their
Back-ground._


/If/ your figure be dark, place it on a light ground; if it be light,
upon a dark ground; and if it be partly light and partly dark, as is
generally the case, contrive that the dark part of the figure be upon
the light part of the ground, and the light side of it against the
dark[39].CC./--_Of proper Back-grounds._


/It/ is of the greatest importance to consider well the nature of
back-grounds, upon which any opake body is to be placed.In order to
detach it properly, you should place the light part of such opake body
against the dark part of the back-ground, and the dark parts on a light
ground[40]; as in the cut[41].[Illustration]




/Chap.CCI./--_Of the general Light diffused over Figures._


/In/ compositions of many figures and animals, observe, that the parts
of these different objects ought to be darker in proportion as they are
lower, and as they are nearer the middle of the groups, though they
are all of an uniform colour.This is necessary, because a smaller
portion of the sky (from which all bodies are illuminated) can give
light to the lower spaces between these different figures, than to the
upper parts of the spaces.It is proved thus: A B C D is that portion
of the sky which gives light to all the objects beneath; M and N are
the bodies which occupy the space S T R H, in which it is evidently
perceived, that the point F, receiving the light only from the portion
of the sky C D, has a smaller quantity of it than the point E which
receives it from the whole space A B (a larger portion than C D);
therefore it will be lighter in E than in F.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCII./--_Of those Parts in Shadows which appear the darkest at a
Distance._


[Illustration]

/The/ neck, or any other part which is raised straight upwards, and
has a projection over it, will be darker than the perpendicular
front of that projection; and this projecting part will be lighter,
in proportion as it presents a larger surface to the light.For
instance, the recess A receives no light from any part of the sky G
K, but B begins to receive the light from the part of the sky H K,
and C from G K; and the point D receives the whole of F K. Therefore
the chest will be as light as the forehead, nose, and chin.But what
I have particularly to recommend, in regard to faces, is, that you
observe well those different qualities of shades which are lost at
different distances (while there remain only the first and principal
spots or strokes of shades, such as those of the sockets of the eyes,
and other similar recesses, which are always dark), and at last the
whole face becomes obscured; because the greatest lights (being small
in proportion to the demi-tints) are lost.The quality, therefore,
and quantity of the principal lights and shades are by means of great
distance blended together into a general half-tint; and this is the
reason why trees and other objects are found to be in appearance darker
at some distance than they are in reality, when nearer to the eye.But then the air, which interposes between the objects and the eye,
will render them light again by tinging them with azure, rather in the
shades than in the lights; for the lights will preserve the truth of
the different colours much longer.CCIII./--_Of the Eye viewing the Folds of Draperies surrounding
a Figure._


/The/ shadows between the folds of a drapery surrounding the parts of
the human body will be darker as the deep hollows where the shadows are
generated are more directly opposite the eye.This is to be observed
only when the eye is placed between the light and the shady part of the
figure.CCIV./--_Of the Relief of Figures remote from the Eye._


/Any/ opake body appears less relieved in proportion as it is farther
distant from the eye; because the air, interposed between the eye
and such body, being lighter than the shadow of it, it tarnishes and
weakens that shadow, lessens its power, and consequently lessens also
its relief.CCV./--_Of Outlines of Objects on the Side towards the Light._


/The/ extremities of any object on the side which receives the light,
will appear darker if upon a lighter ground, and lighter if seen upon a
darker ground.But if such body be flat, and seen upon a ground equal
in point of light with itself, and of the same colour, such boundaries,
or outlines, will be entirely lost to the sight[42].CCVI./--_How to make Objects detach from their Ground, that is
to say, from the Surface on which they are painted._


/Objects/ contrasted with a light ground will appear much more detached
than those which are placed against a dark one.The reason is, that
if you wish to give relief to your figures, you will make those parts
which are the farthest from the light, participate the least of it;
therefore they will remain the darkest, and every distinction of
outline would be lost in the general mass of shadows.But to give it
grace, roundness, and effect, those dark shades are always attended by
reflexes, or else they would either cut too hard upon the ground, or
stick to it, by the similarity of shade, and relieve the less as the
ground is darker; for at some distance nothing would be seen but the
light parts, therefore your figures would appear mutilated of all that
remains lost in the back-ground.CCVII./--_A Precept._


/Figures/ will have more grace, placed in the open and general light,
than in any particular or small one; because the powerful and
extended light will surround and embrace the objects: and works done
in that kind of light appear pleasant and graceful when placed at a
distance[43], while those which are drawn in a narrow light, will
receive great force of shadow, but will never appear at a great
distance, but as painted objects.CCVIII./--_Of the Interposition of transparent Bodies between
the Eye and the Object._


/The/ greater the transparent interposition is between the eye and the
object, the more the colour of that object will participate of, or be
changed into that of the transparent medium[44].When an opake body is situated between the eye and the luminary, so
that the central line of the one passes also through the centre of the
other, that object will be entirely deprived of light.CCIX./--_Of proper Back-grounds for Figures._


/As/ we find by experience, that all bodies are surrounded by lights
and shadows, I would have the painter to accommodate that part which is
enlightened, so as to terminate upon something dark; and to manage the
dark parts so that they may terminate on a light ground.This will be
of great assistance in detaching and bringing out his figures[45].CCX./--_Of Back-grounds._


/To/ give a great effect to figures, you must oppose to a light one a
dark ground, and to a dark figure a light ground, contrasting white
with black, and black with white.In general, all contraries give a
particular force and brilliancy of effect by their opposition[46].CCXI./--_Of Objects placed on a light Ground, and why such a
Practice is useful in Painting._


/When/ a darkish body terminates upon a light ground, it will appear
detached from that ground; because all opake bodies of a curved
surface are not only dark on that side which receives no light, and
consequently very different from the ground; but even that side of the
curved surface which is enlightened, will not carry its principal light
to the extremities, but have between the ground and the principal light
a certain demi-tint, darker than either the ground or that light.CCXII./--_Of the different Effects of White, according to the
Difference of Back-grounds._


/Any/ thing white will appear whiter, by being opposed to a dark
ground; and, on the contrary, darker upon a light ground.This we learn
from observing snow as it falls; while it is descending it appears
darker against the sky, than when we see it against an open window,
which (owing to the darkness of the inside of the house) makes it
appear very white.Observe also, that snow appears to fall very quick
and in a great quantity when near the eye; but when at some distance,
it seems to come down slowly, and in a smaller quantity[47].CCXIII./--_Of Reverberation._


/Reverberations/ are produced by all bodies of a bright nature, that
have a smooth and tolerably hard surface, which, repelling the light it
receives, makes it rebound like a foot-ball against the first object
opposed to it.CCXIV./--_Where there cannot be any Reverberation of Light._


/The/ surfaces of hard bodies are surrounded by various qualities of
light and shadow.The lights are of two sorts; one is called original,
the other derivative.The original light is that which comes from the
sun, or the brightness of fire, or else from the air.But to return to our definition, I say, there can
be no reflexion on that side which is turned towards any dark body;
such as roofs, either high or low, shrubs, grass, wood, either dry
or green; because, though every individual part of those objects be
turned towards the original light, and struck by it; yet the quantity
of shadow which every one of these parts produces upon the others, is
so great, that, upon the whole, the light, not forming a compact mass,
loses its effect, so that those objects cannot reflect any light upon
the opposite bodies.CCXV./--_In what Part the Reflexes have more or less Brightness._


/The/ reflected lights will be more or less apparent or bright, in
proportion as they are seen against a darker or fainter ground; because
if the ground be darker than the reflex, then this reflex will appear
stronger on account of the great difference of colour.But, on the
contrary, if this reflexion has behind it a ground lighter than itself,
it will appear dark, in comparison to the brightness which is close to
it, and therefore it will be hardly perceptible[48].CCXVI./--_Of the reflected Lights which surround the Shadows._


/The/ reflected lights which strike upon the midst of shadows, will
brighten up or lessen their obscurity in proportion to the strength
of those lights, and their proximity to those shadows.Many painters
neglect this observation, while others attend to and deduce their
practice from it.This difference of opinion and practice divides the
sentiments of artists, so that they blame each other for not thinking
and acting as they themselves do.The best way is to steer a middle
course, and not to admit of any reflected light, but when the cause of
it is evident to every eye; and _vice versa_, if you introduce none
at all, let it appear evident that there was no reasonable cause for
it.In doing so, you will neither be totally blamed nor praised by the
variety of opinion, which, if not proceeding from entire ignorance,
will ensure to you the approbation of both parties.CCXVII./--_Where Reflexes are to be most apparent._


/Of/ all reflected lights, that is to be the most apparent, bold, and
precise, which detaches from the darkest ground; and, on the contrary,
that which is upon a lighter ground will be less apparent.And this
proceeds from the contraste of shades, by which the faintest makes the
dark ones appear still darker; so in contrasted lights, the brightest
cause the others to appear less bright than they really are[49].CCXVIII./--_What Part of a Reflex is to be the lightest._


/That/ part will be the brightest which receives the reflected light
between angles the most nearly equal.For example, let N be the
luminary, and A B the illuminated part of the object, reflecting the
light over all the shady part of the concavity opposite to it.The
light which reflects upon F will be placed between equal angles.But
E at the base will not be reflected by equal angles, as it is evident
that the angle E A B is more obtuse than the angle E B A. The angle
A F B however, though it is between angles of less quality than the
angle E, and has a common base B A, is between angles more nearly equal
than E, therefore it will be lighter in F than in E; and it will also
be brighter, because it is nearer to the part which gives them light.According to the 6th rule[50], which says, that part of the body is to
be the lightest, which is nearest to the luminary.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCXIX./--_Of the Termination of Reflexes on their Grounds._


/The/ termination of a reflected light on a ground lighter than that
reflex, will not be perceivable; but if such a reflex terminates upon a
ground darker than itself, it will be plainly seen; and the more so in
proportion as that ground is darker, and _vice versa_[51].CCXX./--_Of double and treble Reflexions of Light._


/Double/ reflexes are stronger than single ones, and the shadows which
interpose between the common light and these reflexes are very faint.For instance, let A be the luminous body, A N, A S, are the direct
rays, and S N the parts which receive the light from them.O and E are
the places enlightened by the reflexion of that light in those parts.A N E is a single reflex, but A N O, A S O is the double reflex.The
single reflex is that which proceeds from a single light, but the
double reflexion is produced by two different lights.The single one
E is produced by the light striking on B D, while the double one O
proceeds from the enlightened bodies B D and D R co-operating together;
and the shadows which are between N O and S O will be very faint.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCXXI./--_Reflexes in the Water, and particularly those of the
Air._


/The/ only portion of air that will be seen reflected in the water,
will be that which is reflected by the surface of the water to the eye
between equal angles; that is to say, the angle of incidence must be
equal to the angle of reflexion.COLOURS /and/ COLOURING.CCXXII./--_What Surface is best calculated to receive most
Colours._


/White/ is more capable of receiving all sorts of colours, than the
surface of any body whatever, that is not transparent.To prove it, we
shall say, that any void space is capable of receiving what another
space, not void, cannot receive.In the same manner, a white surface,
like a void space, being destitute of any colour, will be fittest to
receive such as are conveyed to it from any other enlightened body, and
will participate more of the colour than black can do; which latter,
like a broken vessel, is not able to contain any thing.CCXXIII./--_What Surface will shew most perfectly its true
Colour._


/That/ opake body will shew its colour more perfect and beautiful,
which has near it another body of the same colour.CCXXIV./--_On what Surfaces the true Colour is least apparent._


/Polished/ and glossy surfaces shew least of their genuine colour.This
is exemplified in the grass of the fields, and the leaves of trees,
which, being smooth and glossy, will reflect the colour of the sun, and
the air, where they strike, so that the parts which receive the light
do not shew their natural colour.CCXXV./--_What Surfaces shew most of their true and genuine
Colour._


/Those/ objects that are the least smooth and polished shew their
natural colours best; as we see in cloth, and in the leaves of such
grass or trees as are of a woolly nature; which, having no lustre,
are exhibited to the eye in their true natural colour; unless that
colour happen to be confused by that of another body casting on them
reflexions of an opposite colour, such as the redness of the setting
sun, when all the clouds are tinged with its colour.CCXXVI./--_Of the Mixture of Colours._


/Although/ the mixture of colours may be extended to an infinite
variety, almost impossible to be described, I will not omit touching
slightly upon it, setting down at first a certain number of simple
colours to serve as a foundation, and with each of these mixing one
of the others; one with one, then two with two, and three with three,
proceeding in this manner to the full mixture of all the colors
together: then I would begin again, mixing two of these colours with
two others, and three with three, four with four, and so on to the end.To these two colours we shall put three; to these three add three more,
and then six, increasing always in the same proportion.I call those simple colours, which are not composed, and cannot be made
or supplied by any mixture of other colours.Black and White are not
reckoned among colours; the one is the representative of darkness, the
other of light: that is, one is a simple privation of light, the other
is light itself.Yet I will not omit mentioning them, because there is
nothing in painting more useful and necessary; since painting is but an
effect produced by lights and shadows, viz.After Black
and White come Blue and Yellow, then Green, and Tawny or Umber, and
then Purple and Red.With these I begin my mixtures, first Black and White, Black and
Yellow, Black and Red; then Yellow and Red: but I shall treat more at
length of these mixtures in a separate work[52], which will be of great
utility, nay very necessary.I shall place this subject between theory
and practice.CCXXVII./--_Of the Colours produced by the Mixture of other
Colours, called secondary Colours._


/The/ first of all simple colours is White, though philosophers will
not acknowledge either White or Black to be colours; because the first
is the cause, or the receiver of colours, the other totally deprived
of them.But as painters cannot do without either, we shall place them
among the others; and according to this order of things, White will
be the first, Yellow the second, Green the third, Blue the fourth,
Red the fifth, and Black the sixth.We shall set down White for the
representative of light, without which no colour can be seen; Yellow
for the earth; Green for water; Blue for air; Red for fire; and Black
for total darkness.If you wish to see by a short process the variety of all the mixed, or
composed colours, take some  glasses, and, through them, look
at all the country round: you will find that the colour of each object
will be altered and mixed with the colour of the glass through which it
is seen; observe which colour is made better, and which is hurt by the
mixture.If the glass be yellow, the colour of the objects may either
be improved, or greatly impaired by it.Black and White will be most
altered, while Green and Yellow will be meliorated.In the same manner
you may go through all the mixtures of colours, which are infinite.Select those which are new and agreeable to the sight; and following
the same method you may go on with two glasses, or three, till you have
found what will best answer your purpose.CCXXVIII./--_Of Verdegris._


/This/ green, which is made of copper, though it be mixed with oil,
will lose its beauty, if it be not varnished immediately.It not only
fades, but, if washed with a sponge and pure water only, it will detach
from the ground upon which it is painted, particularly in damp weather;
because verdegris is produced by the strength of salts, which easily
dissolve in rainy weather, but still more if washed with a wet sponge.CCXXIX./--_How to increase the Beauty of Verdegris._


/If/ you mix with the Verdegris some Caballine Aloe, it will add to it
a great degree of beauty.It would acquire still more from Saffron, if
it did not fade.The quality and goodness of this Aloe will be proved
by dissolving it in warm Brandy.Supposing the Verdegris has already
been used, and the part finished, you may then glaze it thinly with
this dissolved Aloe, and it will produce a very fine colour.This Aloe
may be ground also in oil by itself, or with the Verdegris, or any
other colour, at pleasure.CCXXX./--_How to paint a Picture that will last almost for ever._


/After/ you have made a drawing of your intended picture, prepare a
good and thick priming with pitch and brickdust well pounded; after
which give it a second coat of white lead and Naples yellow; then,
having traced your drawing upon it, and painted your picture, varnish
it with clear and thick old oil, and stick it to a flat glass, or
crystal, with a clear varnish.Another method, which may be better,
is, instead of the priming of pitch and brickdust, take a flat tile
well vitrified, then apply the coat of white and Naples yellow, and all
the rest as before.But before the glass is applied to it, the painting
must be perfectly dried in a stove, and varnished with nut oil and
amber, or else with purified nut oil alone, thickened in the sun[53].CCXXXI./--_The Mode of painting on Canvass, or Linen Cloth_[54]./Stretch/ your canvass upon a frame, then give it a coat of weak size,
let it dry, and draw your outlines upon it.Paint the flesh colours
first; and while it is still fresh or moist, paint also the shadows,
well softened and blended together.The flesh colour may be made with
white, lake, and Naples yellow.The shades with black, umber, and
a little lake; you may, if you please, use black chalk.After you
have softened this first coat, or dead colour, and let it dry, you
may retouch over it with lake and other colours, and gum water that
has been a long while made and kept liquid, because in that state it
becomes better, and does not leave any gloss.Again, to make the shades
darker, take the lake and gum as above, and ink[55]; and with this you
may shade or glaze many colours, because it is transparent; such as
azure, lake, and several others.As for the lights, you may retouch
or glaze them slightly with gum water and pure lake, particularly
vermilion.CCXXXII./--_Of lively and beautiful Colours._


/For/ those colours which you mean should appear beautiful, prepare a
ground of pure white.This is meant only for transparent colours: as
for those that have a body, and are opake, it matters not what ground
they have, and a white one is of no use.This is exemplified by painted
glasses; when placed between the eye and clear air, they exhibit most
excellent and beautiful colours, which is not the case, when they have
thick air, or some opake body behind them.CCXXXIII./--_Of transparent Colours._


/When/ a transparent colour is laid upon another of a different
nature, it produces a mixed colour, different from either of the
simple ones which compose it.This is observed in the smoke coming
out of a chimney, which, when passing before the black soot, appears
blueish, but as it ascends against the blue of the sky, it changes its
appearance into a reddish brown.So the colour lake laid on blue will
turn it to a violet colour; yellow upon blue turns to green; saffron
upon white becomes yellow; white scumbled upon a dark ground appears
blue, and is more or less beautiful, as the white and the ground are
more or less pure.CCXXXIV./--_In what Part a Colour will appear in its greatest
Beauty._


/We/ are to consider here in what part any colour will shew itself in
its most perfect purity; whether in the strongest light or deepest
shadow, in the demi-tint, or in the reflex.It would be necessary to
determine first, of what colour we mean to treat, because different
colours differ materially in that respect.Black is most beautiful
in the shades; white in the strongest light; blue and green in the
half-tint; yellow and red in the principal light; gold in the reflexes;
and lake in the half-tint.CCXXXV./--_How any Colour without Gloss, is more beautiful in
the Lights than in the Shades._


/All/ objects which have no gloss, shew their colours better in the
light than in the shadow, because the light vivifies and gives a true
knowledge of the nature of the colour, while the shadows lower, and
destroy its beauty, preventing the discovery of its nature.If, on the
contrary, black be more beautiful in the shadows, it is because black
is not a colour.CCXXXVI./--_Of the Appearance of Colours._


/The/ lighter a colour is in its nature, the more so it will appear when
removed to some distance; but with dark colours it is quite the reverse.CCXXXVII./--_What Part of a Colour is to be the most beautiful._


/If/ A be the light, and B the object receiving it in a direct line,
E cannot receive that light, but only the reflexion from B, which we
shall suppose to be red.In that case, the light it produces being red,
it will tinge with red the object E; and if E happen to be also red
before, you will see that colour increase in beauty, and appear redder
than B; but if E were yellow, you will see a new colour, participating
of the red and the yellow.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCXXXVIII./--_That the Beauty of a Colour is to be found
in the Lights._


/As/ the quality of colours is discovered to the eye by the light, it
is natural to conclude, that where there is most light, there also
the true quality of the colour is to be seen; and where there is most
shadow the colour will participate of, and be tinged with the colour of
that shadow.Remember then to shew the true quality of the colour in
the light parts only[56].CCXXXIX./--_Of Colours._


/The/ colour which is between the light and the shadow will not be so
beautiful as that which is in the full light.Therefore the chief beauty
of colours will be found in the principal lights[57].CCXL./--_No Object appears in its true Colour, unless the
Light which strikes upon it be of the same Colour._


/This/ is very observable in draperies, where the light folds casting a
reflexion, and throwing a light on other folds opposite to them, make
them appear in their natural colour.The same effect is produced by gold
leaves casting their light reciprocally on each other.The effect is
quite contrary if the light be received from an object of a different
colour[58].CCXLI./--_Of the Colour of Shadows._


/The/ colour of the shadows of an object can never be pure if the body
which is opposed to these shadows be not of the same colour as that on
which they are produced.For instance, if in a room, the walls of which
are green, I place a figure clothed in blue, and receiving the light
from another blue object, the light part of that figure will be of a
beautiful blue, but the shadows of it will become dingy, and not like a
true shade of that beautiful blue, because it will be corrupted by the
reflexions from the green wall; and it would be still worse if the walls
were of a darkish brown.CCXLII./--_Of Colours._


/Colours/ placed in shadow will preserve more or less of their original
beauty, as they are more or less immersed in the shade.But colours
situated in a light space will shew their natural beauty in proportion
to the brightness of that light.Some say, that there is as great
variety in the colours of shadows, as in the colours of objects shaded
by them.It may be answered, that colours placed in shadow will shew
less variety amongst themselves as the shadows are darker.We shall
soon convince ourselves of this truth, if, from a large square, we look
through the open door of a church, where pictures, though enriched with
a variety of colours, appear all clothed in darkness.CCXLIII./--_Whether it be possible for all Colours to
appear alike by means of the same Shadow._


/It/ is very possible that all the different colours may be changed
into that of a general shadow; as is manifest in the darkness of a
cloudy night, in which neither the shape nor colour of bodies is
distinguished.Total darkness being nothing but a privation of the
primitive and reflected lights, by which the form and colour of bodies
are seen; it is evident, that the cause being removed the effect
ceases, and the objects are entirely lost to the sight.CCXLIV./--_Why White is not reckoned among the Colours._


/White/ is not a colour, but has the power of receiving all the other
colours.When it is placed in a high situation in the country, all its
shades are azure; according to the fourth proposition[59], which says,
that the surface of any opake body participates of the colour of any
other body sending the light to it.Therefore white being deprived of
the light of the sun by the interposition of any other body, will remain
white; if exposed to the sun on one side, and to the open air on the
other, it will participate both of the colour of the sun and of the air.That side which is not opposed to the sun, will be shaded of the colour
of the air.And if this white were not surrounded by green fields all
the way to the horizon, nor could receive any light from that horizon,
without doubt it would appear of one simple and uniform colour, viz.CCXLV./--_Of Colours._


/The/ light of the fire tinges every thing of a reddish yellow; but
this will hardly appear evident, if we do not make the comparison with
the daylight.Towards the close of the evening this is easily done; but
more certainly after the morning twilight; and the difference will be
clearly distinguished in a dark room, when a little glimpse of daylight
strikes upon any part of the room, and there still remains a candle
burning.Without such a trial the difference is hardly perceivable,
particularly in those colours which have most similarity; such as white
and yellow, light green and light blue; because the light which strikes
the blue, being yellow, will naturally turn it green; as we have said
in another place[60], that a mixture of blue and yellow produces green.And if to a green colour you add some yellow, it will make it of a more
beautiful green.CCXLVI./--_Of the Colouring of remote Objects._


/The/ painter, who is to represent objects at some distance from the
eye, ought merely to convey the idea of general undetermined masses,
making choice, for that purpose, of cloudy weather, or towards the
evening, and avoiding, as was said before, to mark the lights and
shadows too strong on the extremities; because they would in that
case appear like spots of difficult execution, and without grace.He
ought to remember, that the shadows are never to be of such a quality,
as to obliterate the proper colour, in which they originated; if the
situation of the <DW52> body be not in total darkness.He ought to
mark no outline, not to make the hair stringy, and not to touch with
pure white, any but those things which in themselves are white; in
short, the lightest touch upon any particular object ought to denote
the beauty of its proper and natural colour.CCXLVII./--_The Surface of all opake Bodies participates
of the Colour of the surrounding Objects._


/The/ painter ought to know, that if any white object is placed between
two walls, one of which is also white, and the other black, there will
be found between the shady side of that object and the light side, a
similar proportion to that of the two walls; and if that object be
blue, the effect will be the same.Having therefore to paint this
object, take some black, similar to that of the wall from which the
reflexes come; and to proceed by a certain and scientific method, do as
follows.When you paint the wall, take a small spoon to measure exactly
the quantity of colour you mean to employ in mixing your tints; for
instance, if you have put in the shading of this wall three spoonfuls
of pure black, and one of white, you have, without any doubt, a mixture
of a certain and precise quality.Now having painted one of the walls
white, and the other dark, if you mean to place a blue object between
them with shades suitable to that colour, place first on your pallet
the light blue, such as you mean it to be, without any mixture of
shade, and it will do for the lightest part of your object.After which
take three spoonfuls of black, and one of this light blue, for your
darkest shades.Then observe whether your object be round or square:
if it be square, these two extreme tints of light and shade will be
close to each other, cutting sharply at the angle; but if it be round,
draw lines from the extremities of the walls to the centre of the
object, and put the darkest shade between equal angles, where the lines
intersect upon the superficies of it; then begin to make them lighter
and lighter gradually to the point N O, lessening the strength of the
shadows as much as that place participates of the light A D, and mixing
that colour with the darkest shade A B, in the same proportion.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCXLVIII./--_General Remarks on Colours._


/Blue/ and green are not simple colours in their nature, for blue is
composed of light and darkness; such is the azure of the sky, viz.Green is composed of a simple and a
mixed colour, being produced by blue and yellow.Any object seen in a mirror, will participate of the colour of that
body which serves as a mirror; and the mirror in its turn is tinged in
part by the colour of the object it represents; they partake more or
less of each other as the colour of the object seen is more or less
strong than the colour of the mirror.That object will appear of the
strongest and most lively colour in the mirror, which has the most
affinity to the colour of the mirror itself.Of  bodies, the purest white will be seen at the greatest
distance, therefore the darker the colour, the less it will bear
distance.Of different bodies equal in whiteness, and in distance from the eye,
that which is surrounded by the greatest darkness will appear the
whitest; and on the contrary, that shadow will appear the darkest that
has the brightest white round it.Of different colours, equally perfect, that will appear most excellent,
which is seen near its direct contrary.A pale colour against red, a
black upon white (though neither the one nor the other are colours),
blue near a yellow; green near red; because each colour is more
distinctly seen, when opposed to its contrary, than to any other
similar to it.Any thing white seen in a dense air full of vapours, will appear larger
than it is in reality.The air, between the eye and the object seen, will change the colour
of that object into its own; so will the azure of the air change the
distant mountains into blue masses.Through a red glass every thing
appears red; the light round the stars is dimmed by the darkness of the
air, which fills the space between the eye and the planets.The true colour of any object whatever will be seen in those parts
which are not occupied by any kind of shade, and have not any gloss (if
it be a polished surface).I say, that white terminating abruptly upon a dark ground, will cause
that part where it terminates to appear darker, and the white whiter.COLOURS IN REGARD TO LIGHT AND SHADOW.CCXLIX./--_Of the Light proper for painting Flesh Colour from
Nature._


/Your/ window must be open to the sky, and the walls painted of a
reddish colour.The summertime is the best, when the clouds conceal the
sun, or else your walls on the south side of the room must be so high,
as that the sun-beams cannot strike on the opposite side, in order
that the reflexion of those beams may not destroy the shadows.CCL./--_Of the Painter's Window._


/The/ window which gives light to a painting-room, ought to be made of
oiled paper, without any cross bar, or projecting edge at the opening,
or any sharp angle in the inside of the wall, but should be slanting by
degrees the whole thickness of it; and the sides be painted black.CCLI./--_The Shadows of Colours._


/The/ shadows of any colour whatever must participate of that colour
more or less, as it is nearer to, or more remote from the mass of
shadows; and also in proportion to its distance from, or proximity to
the mass of light.CCLII./--_Of the Shadows of White._


/To/ any white body receiving the light from the sun, or the air, the
shadows should be of a blueish cast; because white is no colour, but a
receiver of all colours; and as by the fourth proposition[61] we learn,
that the surface of any object participates of the colours of other
objects near it, it is evident that a white surface will participate of
the colour of the air by which it is surrounded.CCLIII./--_Which of the Colours will produce the darkest Shade._


/That/ shade will be the darkest which is produced by the whitest
surface; this also will have a greater propensity to variety than any
other surface; because white is not properly a colour, but a receiver
of colours, and its surface will participate strongly of the colour of
surrounding objects, but principally of black or any other dark colour,
which being the most opposite to its nature, produces the most sensible
difference between the shadows and the lights.CCLIV./--_How to manage, when a White terminates upon another
White._


/When/ one white body terminates on another of the same colour, the
white of these two bodies will be either alike or not.If they be
alike, that object which of the two is nearest to the eye, should be
made a little darker than the other, upon the rounding of the outline;
but if the object which serves as a ground to the other be not quite so
white, the latter will detach of itself, without the help of any darker
termination.CCLV./--_On the Back-grounds of Figures._


/Of/ two objects equally light, one will appear less so if seen upon
a whiter ground; and, on the contrary, it will appear a great deal
lighter if upon a space of a darker shade.So flesh colour will appear
pale upon a red ground, and a pale colour will appear redder upon
a yellow ground.In short, colours will appear what they are not,
according to the ground which surrounds them.CCLVI./--_The Mode of composing History._


/Amongst/ the figures which compose an historical picture, those which
are meant to appear the nearest to the eye, must have the greatest
force; according to the second proposition[62] of the third book, which
says, that colour will be seen in the greatest perfection which has
less air interposed between it and the eye of the beholder; and for
that reason the shadows (by which we express the relievo of bodies)
appear darker when near than when at a distance, being then deadened by
the air which interposes.This does not happen to those shadows which
are near the eye, where they will produce the greatest relievo when
they are darkest.CCLVII./--_Remarks concerning Lights and Shadows._


/Observe/, that where the shadows end, there be always a kind of
half-shadow to blend them with the lights.The shadow derived from any
object will mix more with the light at its termination, in proportion
as it is more distant from that object.But the colour of the shadow
will never be simple: this is proved by the ninth proposition[63],
which says, that the superficies of any object participates of the
colours of other bodies, by which it is surrounded, although it were
transparent, such as water, air, and the like: because the air receives
its light from the sun, and darkness is produced by the privation of
it.But as the air has no colour in itself any more than water, it
receives all the colours that are between the object and the eye.The
vapours mixing with the air in the lower regions near the earth, render
it thick, and apt to reflect the sun's rays on all sides, while the air
above remains dark; and because light (that is, white) and darkness
(that is, black), mixed together, compose the azure that becomes the
colour of the sky, which is lighter or darker in proportion as the air
is more or less mixed with damp vapours.CCLVIII./--_Why the Shadows of Bodies upon a white Wall are
blueish towards Evening._


[Illustration]

/The/ shadows of bodies produced by the redness of the setting
sun, will always be blueish.This is accounted for by the eleventh
proposition[64], which says, that the superficies of any opake body
participates of the colour of the object from which it receives the
light; therefore the white wall being deprived entirely of colour, is
tinged by the colour of those bodies from which it receives the light,
which in this case are the sun and the sky.But because the sun is red
towards the evening, and the sky is blue, the shadow on the wall not
being enlightened by the sun, receives only the reflexion of the sky,
and therefore will appear blue; and the rest of the wall, receiving
light immediately from the sun, will participate of its red colour.CCLIX./--_Of the Colour of Faces._


/The/ colour of any object will appear more or less distinct in
proportion to the extent of its surface.This proportion is proved, by
observing that a face appears dark at a small distance, because, being
composed of many small parts, it produces a great number of shadows;
and the lights being the smallest part of it, are soonest lost to the
sight, leaving only the shadows, which being in a greater quantity, the
whole of the face appears dark, and the more so if that face has on the
head, or at the back, something whiter.CCLX./--_A Precept relating to Painting._


/Where/ the shadows terminate upon the lights, observe well what parts
of them are lighter than the others, and where they are more or less
softened and blended; but above all remember, that young people have
no sharp shadings: their flesh is transparent, something like what
we observe when we put our hand between the sun and eyes; it appears
reddish, and of a transparent brightness.If you wish to know what
kind of shadow will suit the flesh colour you are painting, place one
of your fingers close to your picture, so as to cast a shadow upon it,
and according as you wish it either lighter or darker, put it nearer or
farther from it, and imitate it.CCLXI./--_Of Colours in Shadow._


/It/ happens very often that the shadows of an opake body do not retain
the same colour as the lights.Sometimes they will be greenish, while
the lights are reddish, although this opake body be all over of one
uniform colour.This happens when the light falls upon the object (we
will suppose from the East), and tinges that side with its own colour.In the West we will suppose another opake body of a colour different
from the first, but receiving the same light.This last will reflect
its colour towards the East, and strike the first with its rays on the
opposite side, where they will be stopped, and remain with their full
colour and brightness.We often see a white object with red lights, and
the shades of a blueish cast; this we observe particularly in mountains
covered with snow, at sun-set, when the effulgence of its rays makes
the horizon appear all on fire.CCLXII./--_Of the Choice of Lights._


/Whatever/ object you intend to represent is to be supposed situated
in a particular light, and that entirely of your own choosing.If you
imagine such objects to be in the country, and the sun be overcast,
they will be surrounded by a great quantity of general light.If the
sun strikes upon those objects, then the shadows will be very dark,
in proportion to the lights, and will be determined and sharp; the
primitive as well as the secondary ones.These shadows will vary from
the lights in colour, because on that side the object receives a
reflected light hue from the azure of the air, which tinges that part;
and this is particularly observable in white objects.That side which
receives the light from the sun, participates also of the colour of
that.This may be particularly observed in the evening, when the sun
is setting between the clouds, which it reddens; those clouds being
tinged with the colour of the body illuminating them, the red colour
of the clouds, with that of the sun, casts a hue on those parts which
receive the light from them.On the contrary, those parts which are not
turned towards that side of the sky, remain of the colour of the air,
so that the former and the latter are of two different colours.This
we must not lose sight of, that, knowing the cause of those lights and
shades, it be made apparent in the effect, or else the work will be
false and absurd.But if a figure be situated within a house, and seen
from without, such figure will have its shadows very soft; and if the
beholder stands in the line of the light, it will acquire grace, and do
credit to the painter, as it will have great relief in the lights, and
soft and well-blended shadows, particularly in those parts where the
inside of the room appears less obscure, because there the shadows are
almost imperceptible: the cause of which we shall explain in its proper
place.COLOURS IN REGARD TO BACK-GROUNDS.CCLXIII./--_Of avoiding hard Outlines._


/Do/ not make the boundaries of your figures with any other colour
than that of the back-ground, on which they are placed; that is, avoid
making dark outlines.CCLXIV./--_Of Outlines._


/The/ extremities of objects which are at some distance, are not seen
so distinctly as if they were nearer.Therefore the painter ought to
regulate the strength of his outlines, or extremities, according to the
distance.The boundaries which separate one body from another, are of the nature
of mathematical lines, but not of real lines.The end of any colour
is only the beginning of another, and it ought not to be called a
line, for nothing interposes between them, except the termination of
the one against the other, which being nothing in itself, cannot be
perceivable; therefore the painter ought not to pronounce it in distant
objects.CCLXV./--_Of Back-grounds._


/One/ of the principal parts of painting is the nature and quality of
back-grounds, upon which the extremities of any convex or solid body
will always detach and be distinguished in nature, though the colour
of such objects, and that of the ground, be exactly the same.This
happens, because the convex sides of solid bodies do not receive the
light in the same manner with the ground, for such sides or extremities
are often lighter or darker than the ground.But if such extremities
were to be of the same colour as the ground, and in the same degree
of light, they certainly could not be distinguished.Therefore such a
choice in painting ought to be avoided by all intelligent and judicious
painters; since the intention is to make the objects appear as it were
out of the ground.The above case would produce the contrary effect,
not only in painting, but also in objects of real relievo.CCLXVI./--_How to detach Figures from the Ground._


/All/ solid bodies will appear to have a greater relief, and to come
more out of the canvass, on a ground of an undetermined colour, with
the greatest variety of lights and shades against the confines of
such bodies (as will be demonstrated in its place), provided a proper
diminution of lights in the white tints, and of darkness in the shades,
be judiciously observed.CCLXVII./--_Of Uniformity and Variety of Colours upon plain
Surfaces._


/The/ back-grounds of any flat surfaces which are uniform in colour and
quantity of light, will never appear separated from each other; _vice
versa_, they will appear separated if they are of different colours or
lights.CCLXVIII./--_Of Back-grounds suitable both to Shadows and
Lights._


/The/ shadows or lights which surround figures, or any other objects,
will help the more to detach them the more they differ from the
objects; that is, if a dark colour does not terminate upon another dark
colour, but upon a very different one; as white, or partaking of white,
but lowered, and approximated to the dark shade.CCLXIX./--_The apparent Variation of Colours, occasioned by the
Contraste of the Ground upon which they are placed._


/No/ colour appears uniform and equal in all its parts unless it
terminate on a ground of the same colour.This is very apparent when a
black terminates on a white ground, where the contraste of colour gives
more strength and richness to the extremities than to the middle.CONTRASTE, HARMONY, AND REFLEXES, IN REGARD TO COLOURS.CCLXX./--_Gradation in Painting._


/What/ is fine is not always beautiful and good: I address this to
such painters as are so attached to the beauty of colours, that they
regret being obliged to give them almost imperceptible shadows, not
considering the beautiful relief which figures acquire by a proper
gradation and strength of shadows.Such persons may be compared to
those speakers who in conversation make use of many fine words without
meaning, which altogether scarcely form one good sentence.CCLXXI./--_How to assort Colours in such a Manner as that they
may add Beauty to each other._


/If/ you mean that the proximity of one colour should give beauty to
another that terminates near it, observe the rays of the sun in the
composition of the rainbow, the colours of which are generated by the
falling rain, when each drop in its descent takes every colour of that
bow, as is demonstrated in its place[65].If you mean to represent great darkness, it must be done by contrasting
it with great light; on the contrary, if you want to produce great
brightness, you must oppose to it a very dark shade: so a pale yellow
will cause red to appear more beautiful than if opposed to a purple
colour.There is another rule, by observing which, though you do not increase
the natural beauty of the colours, yet by bringing them together they
may give additional grace to each other, as green placed near red,
while the effect would be quite the reverse, if placed near blue.Harmony and grace are also produced by a judicious arrangement of
colours, such as blue with pale yellow or white, and the like; as will
be noticed in its place.CCLXXII./--_Of detaching the Figures._


/Let/ the colours of which the draperies of your figures are composed,
be such as to form a pleasing variety, to distinguish one from the
other; and although, for the sake of harmony, they should be of the
same nature[66], they must not stick together, but vary in point of
light, according to the distance and interposition of the air between
them.By the same rule, the outlines are to be more precise, or lost,
in proportion to their distance or proximity.CCLXXIII./--_Of the Colour of Reflexes._


/All/ reflected colours are less brilliant and strong, than those which
receive a direct light, in the same proportion as there is between the
light of a body and the cause of that light.CCLXXIV./--_What Body will be the most strongly tinged with the
Colour of any other Object._


/An/ opake surface will partake most of the genuine colour of the body
nearest to it, because a great quantity of the species of colour will
be conveyed to it; whereas such colour would be broken and disturbed if
coming from a more distant object.CCLXXV./--_Of Reflexes._


/Reflexes/ will partake, more or less, both of the colour of the object
which produces them, and of the colour of that object on which they are
produced, in proportion as this latter body is of a smoother or more
polished surface, than that by which they are produced.CCLXXVI./--_Of the Surface of all shadowed Bodies._


/The/ surface of any opake body placed in shadow, will participate of
the colour of any other object which reflects the light upon it.This
is very evident; for if such bodies were deprived of light in the space
between them and the other bodies, they could not shew either shape or
colour.We shall conclude then, that if the opake body be yellow, and
that which reflects the light blue, the part reflected will be green,
because green is composed of blue and yellow.CCLXXVII./--_That no reflected Colour is simple, but is mixed
with the Nature of the other Colours._


/No/ colour reflected upon the surface of another body, will tinge that
surface with its own colour alone, but will be mixed by the concurrence
of other colours also reflected on the same spot.Let us suppose A to
be of a yellow colour, which is reflected on the convex C O E, and that
the blue colour B be reflected on the same place.I say that a mixture
of the blue and yellow colours will tinge the convex surface; and that,
if the ground be white, it will produce a green reflexion, because it
is proved that a mixture of blue and yellow produces a very fine green.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCLXXVIII./--_Of the Colour of Lights and Reflexes._


/When/ two lights strike upon an opake body, they can vary only in
two ways; either they are equal in strength, or they are not.If
they be equal, they may still vary in two other ways, that is, by
the equality or inequality of their brightness; they will be equal,
if their distance be the same; and unequal, if it be otherwise.The
object placed at an equal distance, between two equal lights, in point
both of colour and brightness, may still be enlightened by them in two
different ways, either equally on each side, or unequally.It will be
equally enlightened by them, when the space which remains round the
lights shall be equal in colour, in degree of shade, and in brightness.It will be unequally enlightened by them when the spaces happen to be
of different degrees of darkness.CCLXXIX./--_Why reflected Colours seldom partake of the Colour
of the Body where they meet._


/It/ happens very seldom that the reflexes are of the same colour with
the body from which they proceed, or with that upon which they meet.To exemplify this, let the convex body D F G E be of a yellow colour,
and the body B C, which reflects its colour on it, blue; the part of
the convex surface which is struck by that reflected light, will take
a green tinge, being B C, acted on by the natural light of the air, or
the sun.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCLXXX./--_The Reflexes of Flesh Colours._


/The/ lights upon the flesh colours, which are reflected by the light
striking upon another flesh-<DW52> body, are redder and more lively
than any other part of the human figure; and that happens according
to the third proposition of the second book[67], which says, the
surface of any opake body participates of the colour of the object
which reflects the light, in proportion as it is near to or remote
from it, and also in proportion to the size of it; because, being
large, it prevents the variety of colours in smaller objects round it,
from interfering with, and discomposing the principal colour, which
is nearer.Nevertheless it does not prevent its participating more of
the colour of a small object near it, than of a large one more remote.See the sixth proposition[68] of perspective, which says, that large
objects may be situated at such a distance as to appear less than small
ones that are near.CCLXXXI./--_Of the Nature of Comparison._


/Black/ draperies will make the flesh of the human figure appear whiter
than in reality it is[69]; and white draperies, on the contrary, will
make it appear darker.Yellow will render it higher, while red
will make it pale.CCLXXXII./--_Where the Reflexes are seen._


/Of/ all reflexions of the same shape, size, and strength, that will be
more or less strong, which terminates on a ground more or less dark.The surface of those bodies will partake most of the colour of the
object that reflects it, which receive that reflexion by the most
nearly equal angles.Of the colours of objects reflected upon any opposite surface by equal
angles, that will be the most distinct which has its reflecting ray the
shortest.Of all colours, reflected under equal angles, and at equal distance
upon the opposite body, those will be the strongest, which come
reflected by the lightest <DW52> body.That object will reflect its own colour most precisely on the opposite
object, which has not round it any colour that clashes with its own;
and consequently that reflected colour will be most confused which
takes its origin from a variety of bodies of different colours.That colour which is nearest the opposed object, will tinge it the most
strongly; and _vice versa_: let the painter, therefore, in his reflexes
on the human body, particularly on the flesh colour, mix some of the
colour of the drapery which comes nearest to it; but not pronounce it
too distinctly, if there be not good reason for it.CCLXXXIII./--_A Precept of Perspective in regard to Painting._


/When/, on account of some particular quality of the air, you can no
longer distinguish the difference between the lights and shadows of
objects, you may reject the perspective of shadows, and make use only
of the linear perspective, and the diminution of colours, to lessen the
knowledge of the objects opposed to the eye; and this, that is to say,
the loss of the knowledge of the figure of each object, will make the
same object appear more remote.The eye can never arrive at a perfect knowledge of the interval between
two objects variously distant, by means of the linear perspective
alone, if not assisted by the perspective of colours.CCLXXXIV./--_Of the Perspective of Colours._


/The/ air will participate less of the azure of the sky, in proportion
as it comes nearer to the horizon, as it is proved by the third and
ninth proposition[70], that pure and subtile bodies (such as compose
the air) will be less illuminated by the sun than those of thicker and
grosser substance: and as it is certain that the air which is remote
from the earth, is thinner than that which is near it, it will follow,
that the latter will be more impregnated with the rays of the sun,
which giving light at the same time to an infinity of atoms floating
in this air, renders it more sensible to the eye.So that the air will
appear lighter towards the horizon, and darker as well as bluer in
looking up to the sky; because there is more of the thick air between
our eyes and the horizon, than between our eyes and that part of the
sky above our heads.[Illustration]

For instance: if the eye placed in P, looks through the air along the
line P R, and then lowers itself a little along P S, the air will begin
to appear a little whiter, because there is more of the thick air in
this space than in the first.And if it be still removed lower, so
as to look straight at the horizon, no more of that blue sky will be
perceived which was observable along the first line P R, because there
is a much greater quantity of thick air along the horizontal line P D,
than along the oblique P S, or the perpendicular P R.CCLXXXV./--_The Cause of the Diminution of Colours._


/The/ natural colour of any visible object will be diminished in
proportion to the density of any other substance which interposes
between that object and the eye.CCLXXXVI./--_Of the Diminution of Colours and Objects._


/Let/ the colours vanish in proportion as the objects diminish in size,
according to the distance.CCLXXXVII./--_Of the Variety observable in Colours, according to
their Distance, or Proximity._


/The/ local colour of such objects as are darker than the air, will
appear less dark as they are more remote; and, on the contrary, objects
lighter than the air will lose their brightness in proportion to their
distance from the eye.In general, all objects that are darker or
lighter than the air, are discoloured by distance, which changes their
quality, so that the lighter appears darker, and the darker lighter.CCLXXXVIII./--_At what Distance Colours are entirely lost._


/Local/ colours are entirely lost at a greater or less distance,
according as the eye and the object are more or less elevated from the
earth.This is proved by the seventh proposition[71], which says, the
air is more or less pure, as it is near to, or remote from the earth.If the eye then, and the object are near the earth, the thickness of
the air which interposes, will in a great measure confuse the colour of
that object to the eye.But if the eye and the object are placed high
above the earth, the air will disturb the natural colour of that object
very little.In short, the various gradations of colour depend not only
on the various distances, in which they may be lost; but also on the
variety of lights, which change according to the different hours of the
day, and the thickness or purity of the air, through which the colour
of the object is conveyed to the eye.CCLXXXIX./--_Of the Change observable in the same Colour,
according to its Distance from the Eye._


/Among/ several colours of the same nature, that which is the nearest
to the eye will alter the least; because the air which interposes
between the eye and the object seen, envelopes, in some measure, that
object.If the air, which interposes, be in great quantity, the object
seen will be strongly tinged with the colour of that air; but if the
air be thin, then the view of that object, and its colour, will be very
little obstructed.CCXC./--_Of the blueish Appearance of remote Objects in a
Landscape._


/Whatever/ be the colour of distant objects, the darkest, whether
natural or accidental, will appear the most tinged with azure.By
the natural darkness is meant the proper colour of the object; the
accidental one is produced by the shadow of some other body.CCXCI./--_Of the Qualities in the Surface which first lose
themselves by Distance._


/The/ first part of any colour which is lost by the distance, is the
gloss, being the smallest part of it, as a light within a light.The
second that diminishes by being farther removed, is the light, because
it is less in quantity than the shadow.The third is the principal
shadows, nothing remaining at last but a kind of middling obscurity.CCXCII./--_From what Cause the Azure of the Air proceeds._


/The/ azure of the sky is produced by the transparent body of the
air, illumined by the sun, and interposed between the darkness of the
expanse above, and the earth below.The air in itself has no quality
of smell, taste, or colour, but is easily impregnated with the quality
of other matter surrounding it; and will appear bluer in proportion to
the darkness of the space behind it, as may be observed against the
shady sides of mountains, which are darker than any other object.In
this instance the air appears of the most beautiful azure, while on the
other side that receives the light, it shews through that more of the
natural colour of the mountain.CCXCIII./--_Of the Perspective of Colours._


/The/ same colour being placed at various distances and equal
elevation, the force and effect of its colouring will be according
to the proportion of the distance which there is from each of these
colours to the eye.It is proved thus: let C B E D be one and the same
colour.The first, E, is placed at two degrees of distance from the eye
A; the second, B, shall be four degrees, the third, C, six degrees,
and the fourth, D, eight degrees; as appears by the circles which
terminate upon and intersect the line A R. Let us suppose that the
space A R, S P, is one degree of thin air, and S P E T another degree
of thicker air.It will follow, that the first colour, E, will pass
to the eye through one degree of thick air, E S, and through another
degree, S A, of thinner air.And B will send its colour to the eye in
A, through two degrees of thick air, and through two others of the
thinner sort.C will send it through three degrees of the thin, and
three of the thick sort, while D goes through four degrees of the one,
and four of the other.This demonstrates, that the gradation of colours
is in proportion to their distance from the eye[72].But this happens
only to those colours which are on a level with the eye; as for those
which happen to be at unequal elevations, we cannot observe the same
rule, because they are in that case situated in different qualities of
air, which alter and diminish these colours in various manners.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCXCIV./--_Of the Perspective of Colours in dark Places._


/In/ any place where the light diminishes in a gradual proportion till
it terminates in total darkness, the colours also will lose themselves
and be dissolved in proportion as they recede from the eye.CCXCV./--_Of the Perspective of Colours._


/The/ principal colours, or those nearest to the eye, should be pure
and simple; and the degree of their diminution should be in proportion
to their distance, viz.the nearer they are to the principal point, the
more they will possess of the purity of those colours, and they will
partake of the colour of the horizon in proportion as they approach to
it.CCXCVI./--_Of Colours._


/Of/ all the colours which are not blue, those that are nearest to
black will, when distant, partake most of the azure; and, on the
contrary, those will preserve their proper colour at the greatest
distance, that are most dissimilar to black.The green therefore of the fields will change sooner into blue than
yellow, or white, which will preserve their natural colour at a greater
distance than that, or even red.CCXCVII./--_How it happens that Colours do not change, though
placed in different Qualities of Air._


/The/ colour will not be subject to any alteration when the distance
and the quality of air have a reciprocal proportion.What it loses by
the distance it regains by the purity of the air, viz.if we suppose
the first or lowest air to have four degrees of thickness, and the
colour to be at one degree from the eye, and the second air above to
have three degrees.The air having lost one degree of thickness, the
colour will acquire one degree upon the distance.And when the air
still higher shall have lost two degrees of thickness, the colour will
acquire as many upon the distance; and in that case the colour will be
the same at three degrees as at one.But to be brief, if the colour be
raised so high as to enter that quality of air which has lost three
degrees of thickness, and acquired three degrees of distance, then you
may be certain that that colour which is high and remote, has lost
no more than the colour which is below and nearer; because in rising
it has acquired those three degrees which it was losing by the same
distance from the eye; and this is what was meant to be proved.CCXCVIII./--_Why Colours experience no apparent Change, though
placed in different Qualities of Air._


[Illustration]

/It/ may happen that a colour does not alter, though placed at
different distances, when the thickness of the air and the distance
are in the same inverse proportion.It is proved thus: let A be the
eye, and H any colour whatever, placed at one degree of distance
from the eye, in a quality of air of four degrees of thickness; but
because the second degree above, A M N L, contains a thinner air by
one half, which air conveys this colour, it follows that this colour
will appear as if removed double the distance it was at before, viz.at two degrees of distance, A F and F G, from the eye; and it will be
placed in G. If that is raised to the second degree of air A M N L, and
to the degree O M, P N, it will necessarily be placed at E, and will
be removed from the eye the whole length of the line A E, which will
be proved in this manner to be equal in thickness to the distance A G.
If in the same quality of air the distance A G interposed between the
eye and the colour occupies two degrees, and A E occupies two degrees
and a half, it is sufficient to preserve the colour G, when raised to
E, from any change, because the degree A C and the degree A F being
the same in thickness, are equal and alike, and the degree C D, though
equal in length to the degree F G, is not alike in point of thickness
of air; because half of it is situated in a degree of air of double the
thickness of the air above: this half degree of distance occupies as
much of the colour as one whole degree of the air above would, which
air above is twice as thin as the air below, with which it terminates;
so that by calculating the thickness of the air, and the distances,
you will find that the colours have changed places without undergoing
any alteration in their beauty.And we shall prove it thus: reckoning
first the thickness of air, the colour H is placed in four degrees of
thickness, the colour G in two degrees, and E at one degree.Now let
us see whether the distances are in an equal inverse proportion; the
colour E is at two degrees and a half of distance, G at two degrees,
and H at one degree.But as this distance has not an exact proportion
with the thickness of air, it is necessary to make a third calculation
in this manner: A C is perfectly like and equal to A F; the half
degree, C B, is like but not equal to A F, because it is only half a
degree in length, which is equal to a whole degree of the quality of
the air above; so that by this calculation we shall solve the question.For A C is equal to two degrees of thickness of the air above, and the
half degree C B is equal to a whole degree of the same air above; and
one degree more is to be taken in, viz.A H has four degrees of thickness of air, A G also four, viz.A F two
in value, and F G also two, which taken together make four.A E has
also four, because A C contains two, and C D one, which is the half
of A C, and in the same quality of air; and there is a whole degree
above in the thin air, which all together make four.So that if A E is
not double the distance A G, nor four times the distance A H, it is
made equivalent by the half degree C B of thick air, which is equal
to a whole degree of thin air above.This proves the truth of the
proposition, that the colour H G E does not undergo any alteration by
these different distances.CCXCIX./--_Contrary Opinions in regard to Objects seen afar off._


/Many/ painters will represent the objects darker, in proportion as
they are removed from the eye; but this cannot be true, unless the
objects seen be white; as shall be examined in the next chapter.CCC./--_Of the Colour of Objects remote from the Eye._


/The/ air tinges objects with its own colour more or less in proportion
to the quantity of intervening air between it and the eye, so that a
dark object at the distance of two miles (or a density of air equal to
such distance), will be more tinged with its colour than if only one
mile distant.It is said, that, in a landscape, trees of the same species appear
darker in the distance than near; this cannot be true, if they be of
equal size, and divided by equal spaces.But it will be so if the
first trees are scattered, and the light of the fields is seen through
and between them, while the others which are farther off, are thick
together, as is often the case near some river or other piece of water:
in this case no space of light fields can be perceived, but the trees
appear thick together, accumulating the shadow on each other.It also
happens, that as the shady parts of plants are much broader than the
light ones, the colour of the plants becoming darker by the multiplied
shadows, is preserved, and conveyed to the eye more strongly than that
of the other parts; these masses, therefore, will carry the strongest
parts of their colour to a greater distance.CCCI./--_Of the Colour of Mountains._


/The/ darker the mountain is in itself, the bluer it will appear at a
great distance.The highest part will be the darkest, as being more
woody; because woods cover a great many shrubs, and other plants,
which never receive any light.The wild plants of those woods are also
naturally of a darker hue than cultivated plants; for oak, beech, fir,
cypress, and pine trees are much darker than olive and other domestic
plants.Near the top of these mountains, where the air is thinner and
purer, the darkness of the woods will make it appear of a deeper azure,
than at the bottom, where the air is thicker.A plant will detach very
little from the ground it stands upon, if that ground be of a colour
something similar to its own; and, _vice versa_, that part of any white
object which is nearest to a dark one, will appear the whitest, and
the less so as it is removed from it; and any dark object will appear
darker, the nearer it is to a white one; and less so, if removed from
it.CCCII./--_Why the Colour and Shape of Objects are lost in some
Situations apparently dark, though not so in Reality._


/There/ are some situations which, though light, appear dark, and in
which objects are deprived both of form and colour.This is caused by
the great light which pervades the intervening air; as is observable by
looking in through a window at some distance from the eye, when nothing
is seen but an uniform darkish shade; but if we enter the house, we
shall find that room to be full of light, and soon distinguish every
small object contained within that window.This difference of effect
is produced by the great brightness of the air, which contracts
considerably the pupil of the eye, and by so doing diminishes its
power.But in dark places the pupil is enlarged, and acquires as much
in strength, as it increases in size.This is proved in my second
proposition of perspective[73].CCCIII./--_Various Precepts in Painting._


/The/ termination and shape of the parts in general are very little
seen, either in great masses of light, or of shadows; but those which
are situated between the extremes of light and shade are the most
distinct.Perspective, as far as it extends in regard to painting, is divided
into three principal parts; the first consists in the diminution of
size, according to distance; the second concerns the diminution of
colours in such objects; and the third treats of the diminution of the
perception altogether of those objects, and of the degree of precision
they ought to exhibit at various distances.The azure of the sky is produced by a mixture composed of light and
darkness[74]; I say of light, because of the moist particles floating
in the air, which reflect the light.By darkness, I mean the pure air,
which has none of these extraneous particles to stop and reflect the
rays.Of this we see an example in the air interposed between the eye
and some dark mountains, rendered so by the shadows of an innumerable
quantity of trees; or else shaded on one side by the natural privation
of the rays of the sun; this air becomes azure, but not so on the side
of the mountain which is light, particularly when it is covered with
snow.Among objects of equal darkness and equal distance, those will appear
darker that terminate upon a lighter ground, and _vice versa_[75].That object which is painted with the most white and the most black,
will shew greater relief than any other; for that reason I would
recommend to painters to colour and dress their figures with the
brightest and most lively colours; for if they are painted of a dull
or obscure colour, they will detach but little, and not be much seen,
when the picture is placed at some distance; because the colour of
every object is obscured in the shades; and if it be represented as
originally so all over, there will be but little difference between
the lights and the shades, while lively colours will shew a striking
difference.CCCIV./--_Aerial Perspective._


/There/ is another kind of perspective called aerial, because by the
difference of the air it is easy to determine the distance of different
objects, though seen on the same line; such, for instance, as buildings
behind a wall, and appearing all of the same height above it.If in
your picture you want to have one appear more distant than another, you
must first suppose the air somewhat thick, because, as we have said
before, in such a kind of air the objects seen at a great distance,
as mountains are, appear blueish like the air, by means of the great
quantity of air that interposes between the eye and such mountains.You will then paint the first building behind that wall of its proper
colour; the next in point of distance, less distinct in the outline,
and participating, in a greater degree, of the blueish colour of the
air; another which you wish to send off as much farther, should be
painted as much bluer; and if you wish one of them to appear five times
farther removed beyond the wall, it must have five times more of the
azure.By this rule these buildings which appeared all of the same
size, and upon the same line, will be distinctly perceived to be of
different dimensions, and at different distances.CCCV./--_The Parts of the Smallest Objects will first disappear
in Painting._


/Of/ objects receding from the eye the smallest will be the first lost
to the sight; from which it follows, that the largest will be the last
to disappear.The painter, therefore, ought not to finish the parts of
those objects which are very far off, but follow the rule given in the
sixth book[76].How many, in the representation of towns, and other objects remote
from the eye, express every part of the buildings in the same manner
as if they were very near.It is not so in nature, because there is no
sight so powerful as to perceive distinctly at any great distance the
precise form of parts or extremities of objects.The painter therefore
who pronounces the outlines, and the minute distinction of parts, as
several have done, will not give the representation of distant objects,
but by this error will make them appear exceedingly near.Again, the
angles of buildings in distant towns are not to be expressed (for they
cannot be seen), considering that angles are formed by the concurrence
of two lines into one point, and that a point has no parts; it is
therefore invisible.CCCVI./--_Small Figures ought not to be too much finished._


/Objects/ appear smaller than they really are when they are distant
from the eye, and because there is a great deal of air interposed,
which weakens the appearance of forms, and, by a natural consequence,
prevents our seeing distinctly the minute parts of such objects.It
behoves the painter therefore to touch those parts slightly, in an
unfinished manner; otherwise it would be against the effect of Nature,
whom he has chosen for his guide.For, as we said before, objects
appear small on account of their great distance from the eye; that
distance includes a great quantity of air, which, forming a dense body,
obstructs the light, and prevents our seeing the minute parts of the
objects.CCCVII./--_Why the Air is to appear whiter as it approaches
nearer to the Earth._


/As/ the air is thicker nearer the earth, and becomes thinner as it
rises, look, when the sun is in the east, towards the west, between the
north and south, and you will perceive that the thickest and lowest air
will receive more light from the sun than the thinner air, because its
beams meet with more resistance.If the sky terminate low, at the end of a plain, that part of it
nearest to the horizon, being seen only through the thick air, will
alter and break its natural colour, and will appear whiter than over
your head, where the visual ray does not pass through so much of that
gross air, corrupted by earthy vapours.But if you turn towards the
east, the air will be darker the nearer it approaches the earth; for
the air being thicker, does not admit the light of the sun to pass so
freely.CCCVIII./--_How to paint the distant Part of a Landscape._


/It/ is evident that the air is in some parts thicker and grosser than
in others, particularly that nearest to the earth; and as it rises
higher, it becomes thinner and more transparent.The objects which
are high and large, from which you are at some distance, will be less
apparent in the lower parts; because the visual ray which perceives
them, passes through a long space of dense air; and it is easy to prove
that the upper parts are seen by a line, which, though on the side of
the eye it originates in a thick air, nevertheless, as it ascends to
the highest summit of its object, terminates in an air much thinner
than that of the lower parts; and for that reason the more that line
or visual ray advances from the eye, it becomes, in its progress
from one point to another, thinner and thinner, passing from a pure
air into another which is purer; so that a painter who has mountains
to represent in a landscape, ought to observe, that from one hill
to another, the tops will appear always clearer than the bases.In
proportion as the distance from one to another is greater, the top will
be clearer; and the higher they are, the more they will shew their
variety of form and colour.CCCIX./--_Of precise and confused Objects._


/The/ parts that are near in the fore-ground should be finished in a
bold determined manner; but those in the distance must be unfinished,
and confused in their outlines.CCCX./--_Of distant Objects._


/That/ part of any object which is nearest to the luminary from which
it receives the light, will be the lightest.The representation of an object in every degree of distance, loses
degrees of its strength; that is, in proportion as the object is more
remote from the eye it will be less perceivable through the air in its
representation.CCCXI./--_Of Buildings seen in a thick Air._


[Illustration]

/That/ part of a building seen through a thick air, will appear less
distinct than another part seen through a thinner air.Therefore the
eye, N, looking at the tower A D, will see it more confusedly in the
lower degrees, but at the same time lighter; and as it ascends to the
other degrees it will appear more distinct, but somewhat darker.CCCXII./--_Of Towns and other Objects seen through a thick Air._


[Illustration]

/Buildings/ or towns seen through a fog, or the air made thick by
smoke or other vapours, will appear less distinct the lower they
are; and, _vice versa_, they will be sharper and more visible in
proportion as they are higher.We have said, in Chapter cccxxi.that
the air is thicker the lower it is, and thinner as it is higher.It is
demonstrated also by the cut, where the tower, A F, is seen by the eye
N, in a thick air, from B to F, which is divided into four degrees,
growing thicker as they are nearer the bottom.The less the quantity of
air interposed between the eye and its object is, the less also will
the colour of the object participate of the colour of that air.It
follows, that the greater the quantity of the air interposed between
the eye and the object seen, is, the more this object will participate
of the colour of the air.It is demonstrated thus: N being the eye
looking at the five parts of the tower A F, viz.A B C D E, I say,
that if the air were of the same thickness, there would be the same
proportion between the colour of the air at the bottom of the tower and
the colour of the air that the same tower has at the place B, as there
is in length between the line M and F. As, however, we have supposed
that the air is not of equal thickness, but, on the contrary, thicker
as it is lower, it follows, that the proportion by which the air tinges
the different elevations of the tower B C F, exceeds the proportion
of the lines; because the line M F, besides its being longer than the
line S B, passes by unequal degrees through a quality of air which is
unequal in thickness.CCCXIII./--_Of the inferior Extremities of distant Objects._


/The/ inferior or lower extremities of distant objects are not so
apparent as the upper extremities.This is observable in mountains
and hills, the tops of which detach from the sides of other mountains
behind.We see the tops of these more determined and distinctly than
their bases; because the upper extremities are darker, being less
encompassed by thick air, which always remains in the lower regions,
and makes them appear dim and confused.It is the same with trees,
buildings, and other objects high up.From this effect it often happens
that a high tower, seen at a great distance, will appear broad at top,
and narrow at bottom; because the thin air towards the top does not
prevent the angles on the sides and other different parts of the tower
from being seen, as the thick air does at bottom.This is demonstrated
by the seventh proposition[77], which says, that the thick air
interposed between the eye and the sun, is lighter below than above,
and where the air is whiteish, it confuses the dark objects more than if
such air were blueish or thinner, as it is higher up.The battlements
of a fortress have the spaces between equal to the breadth of the
battlement, and yet the space will appear wider; at a great distance
the battlements will appear very much diminished, and being removed
still farther, will disappear entirely, and the fort shew only the
straight wall, as if there were no battlements.CCCXIV./--_Which Parts of Objects disappear first by being
removed farther from the Eye, and which preserve their Appearance._


/The/ smallest parts are those which, by being removed, lose their
appearance first; this may be observed in the gloss upon spherical
bodies, or columns, and the slender parts of animals; as in a stag,
the first sight of which does not discover its legs and horns so soon
as its body, which, being broader, will be perceived from a greater
distance.But the parts which disappear the very first, are the lines
which describe the members, and terminate the surface and shape of
bodies.CCCXV./--_Why Objects are less distinguished in proportion as
they are farther removed from the Eye._


/This/ happens because the smallest parts are lost first; the second,
in point of size, are also lost at a somewhat greater distance, and so
on successively; the parts by degrees melting away, the perception of
the object is diminished; and at last all the parts, and the whole, are
entirely lost to the sight[78].Colours also disappear on account of
the density of the air interposed between the eye and the object.CCCXVI./--_Why Faces appear dark at a Distance._


/It/ is evident that the similitude of all objects placed before us,
large as well as small, is perceptible to our senses through the iris
of the eye.If through so small an entrance the immensity of the sky
and of the earth is admitted, the faces of men (which are scarcely any
thing in comparison of such large objects), being still diminished by
the distance, will occupy so little of the eye, that they become almost
imperceptible.Besides, having to pass through a dark medium from the
surface to the _Retina_ in the inside, where the impression is made,
the colour of faces (not being very strong, and rendered still more
obscure by the darkness of the tube) when arrived at the focus appears
dark.No other reason can be given on that point, except that the speck
in the middle of the apple of the eye is black, and, being full of a
transparent fluid like air, performs the same office as a hole in a
board, which on looking into it appears black; and that those things
which are seen through both a light and dark air, become confused and
obscure.CCCXVII./--_Of Towns and other Buildings seen through a Fog in
the Morning or Evening._


/Buildings/ seen afar off in the morning or in the evening, when there
is a fog, or thick air, shew only those parts distinctly which are
enlightened by the sun towards the horizon; and the parts of those
buildings which are not turned towards the sun remain confused and
almost of the colour of the fog.CCCXVIII./--_Of the Height of Buildings seen in a Fog._


/Of/ a building near the eye the top parts will appear more confused
than the bottom, because there is more fog between the eye and the top
than at the base.And a square tower, seen at a great distance through
a fog, will appear narrower at the base than at the summit.This is
accounted for in Chapter cccxiii.which says, that the fog will appear
whiter and thicker as it approaches the ground; and as it is said
before[79], that a dark object will appear smaller in proportion as it
is placed on a whiter ground.Therefore the fog being whiter at bottom
than at top, it follows that the tower (being darkish) will appear
narrower at the base than at the summit.CCCXIX./--_Why Objects which are high, appear darker at a
Distance than those which are low, though the Fog be uniform, and of
equal Thickness._


/Amongst/ objects situated in a fog, thick air, vapour, smoke, or at
a distance, the highest will be the most distinctly seen: and amongst
objects equal in height, that placed in the darkest fog, will be most
confused and dark.As it happens to the eye H, looking at A B C, three
towers of equal height; it sees the top C as low as R, in two degrees
of thickness; and the top B, in one degree only; therefore the top C
will appear darker than the top of the tower B.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXX./--_Of Objects seen in a Fog._


/Objects/ seen through a fog will appear larger than they are in
reality, because the aerial perspective does not agree with the linear,
viz.the colour does not agree with the magnitude of the object[80];
such a fog being similar to the thickness of air interposed between the
eye and the horizon in fine weather.But in this case the fog is near
the eye, and though the object be also near, it makes it appear as if
it were as far off as the horizon; where a great tower would appear no
bigger than a man placed near the eye.CCCXXI./--_Of those Objects which the Eyes perceive through a
Mist or thick Air._


/The/ nearer the air is to water, or to the ground, the thicker it
becomes.It is proved by the nineteenth proposition of the second
book[81], that bodies rise in proportion to their weight; and it
follows, that a light body will rise higher than another which is heavy.CCCXXII./--_Miscellaneous Observations._


/Of/ different objects equal in magnitude, form, shade, and distance
from the eye, those will appear the smaller that are placed on the
lighter ground.This is exemplified by observing the sun when seen
behind a tree without leaves; all the ramifications seen against that
great light are so diminished that they remain almost invisible.The
same may be observed of a pole placed between the sun and the eye.Parallel bodies placed upright, and seen through a fog, will
appear larger at top than at bottom.This is proved by the ninth
proposition[82], which says, that a fog, or thick air, penetrated by
the rays of the sun, will appear whiter the lower they are.Things seen afar off will appear out of proportion, because the parts
which are the lightest will send their image with stronger rays than
the parts which are darkest.I have seen a woman dressed in black,
with a white veil over her head, which appeared twice as large as her
shoulders covered with black.MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.CCCXXIII./--_Of Objects seen at a Distance._


/Any/ dark object will appear lighter when removed to some distance
from the eye.It follows, by the contrary reason, that a dark object
will appear still darker when brought nearer to the eye.Therefore the
inferior parts of any object whatever, placed in thick air, will appear
farther from the eye at the bottom than at the top; for that reason the
lower parts of a mountain appear farther off than its top, which is in
reality the farthest.CCCXXIV./--_Of a Town seen through a thick Air._


/The/ eye which, looking downwards, sees a town immersed in very thick
air, will perceive the top of the buildings darker, but more distinct
than the bottom.The tops detach against a light ground, because they
are seen against the low and thick air which is beyond them.This is a
consequence of what has been explained in the preceding chapter.CCCXXV./--_How to draw a Landscape._


/Contrive/ that the trees in your landscape be half in shadow and half
in the light.It is better to represent them as when the sun is veiled
with thin clouds, because in that case the trees receive a general
light from the sky, and are darkest in those parts which are nearest to
the earth.CCCXXVI./--_Of the Green of the Country._


/Of/ the greens seen in the country, that of trees and other plants
will appear darker than that of fields and meadows, though they may
happen to be of the same quality.CCCXXVII./--_What Greens will appear most of a blueish Cast._


/Those/ greens will appear to approach nearest to blue which are
of the darkest shade when remote.This is proved by the seventh
proposition[83], which says, that blue is composed of black and white
seen at a great distance.CCCXXVIII./--_The Colour of the Sea from different Aspects._


/When/ the sea is a little ruffled it has no sameness of colour; for
whoever looks at it from the shore, will see it of a dark colour, in a
greater degree as it approaches towards the horizon, and will perceive
also certain lights moving slowly on the surface like a flock of sheep.Whoever looks at the sea from on board a ship, at a distance from the
land, sees it blue.Near the shore it appears darkish, on account of
the colour of the earth reflected by the water, as in a looking-glass;
but at sea the azure of the air is reflected to the eye by the waves in
the same manner.CCCXXIX./--_Why the same Prospect appears larger at some Times
than at others._


/Objects/ in the country appear sometimes larger and sometimes smaller
than they actually are, from the circumstance of the air interposed
between the eye and the horizon, happening to be either thicker or
thinner than usual.Of two horizons equally distant from the eye, that which is seen
through the thicker air will appear farther removed; and the other will
seem nearer, being seen through a thinner air.Objects of unequal size, but equally distant, will appear equal if the
air which is between them and the eye be of proportionable inequality
of thickness, viz.if the thickest air be interposed between the eye
and the smallest of the objects.This is proved by the perspective of
colours[84], which is so deceitful that a mountain which would appear
small by the compasses, will seem larger than a small hill near the
eye; as a finger placed near the eye will cover a large mountain far
off.CCCXXX./--_Of Smoke._


/Smoke/ is more transparent, though darker towards the extremities of
its waves than in the middle.It moves in a more oblique direction in proportion to the force of the
wind which impels it.Different kinds of smoke vary in colour, as the causes that produce
them are various.Smoke never produces determined shadows, and the extremities are lost
as they recede from their primary cause.Objects behind it are less
apparent in proportion to the thickness of the smoke.It is whiter
nearer its origin, and bluer towards its termination.Fire appears darker, the more smoke there is interposed between it and
the eye.Where smoke is farther distant, the objects are less confused by it.It encumbers and dims all the landscape like a fog.Smoke is seen to
issue from different places, with flames at the origin, and the most
dense part of it.The tops of mountains will be more seen than the
lower parts, as in a fog.CCCXXXI./--_In what Part Smoke is lightest._


/Smoke/ which is seen between the sun and the eye will be lighter and
more transparent than any other in the landscape.The same is observed
of dust, and of fog; while, if you place yourself between the sun and
those objects, they will appear dark.CCCXXXII./--_Of the Sun-beams passing through the Openings of
Clouds._


/The/ sun-beams which penetrate the openings interposed between clouds
of various density and form, illuminate all the places over which they
pass, and tinge with their own colour all the dark places that are
behind: which dark places are only seen in the intervals between the
rays.CCCXXXIII./--_Of the Beginning of Rain._


/When/ the rain begins to fall, it tarnishes and darkens the air,
giving it a dull colour, but receives still on one side a faint light
from the sun, and is shaded on the other side, as we observe in clouds;
till at last it darkens also the earth, depriving it entirely of the
light of the sun.Objects seen through the rain appear confused and of
undetermined shape, but those which are near will be more distinct.It
is observable, that on the side where the rain is shaded, objects will
be more clearly distinguished than where it receives the light; because
on the shady side they lose only their principal lights, whilst on
the other they lose both their lights and shadows, the lights mixing
with the light part of the rain, and the shadows are also considerably
weakened by it.CCCXXXIV./--_The Seasons are to be observed._


/In/ Autumn you will represent the objects according as it is more or
less advanced.At the beginning of it the leaves of the oldest branches
only begin to fade, more or less, however, according as the plant is
situated in a fertile or barren country; and do not imitate those who
represent trees of every kind (though at equal distance) with the same
quality of green.Endeavour to vary the colour of meadows, stones,
trunks of trees, and all other objects, as much as possible, for Nature
abounds in variety _ad infinitum_.CCCXXXV./--_The Difference of Climates to be observed._


/Near/ the sea-shore, and in southern parts, you will be careful not to
represent the Winter season by the appearance of trees and fields, as
you would do in places more inland, and in northern countries, except
when these are covered with ever-greens, which shoot afresh all the
year round.CCCXXXVI./--_Of Dust._


/Dust/ becomes lighter the higher it rises, and appears darker the less
it is raised, when it is seen between the eye and the sun.CCCXXXVII./--_How to represent the Wind._


/In/ representing the effect of the wind, besides the bending of trees,
and leaves twisting the wrong side upwards, you will also express the
small dust whirling upwards till it mixes in a confused manner with the
air.CCCXXXVIII./--_Of a Wilderness._


/Those/ trees and shrubs which are by their nature more loaded with
small branches, ought to be touched smartly in the shadows, but those
which have larger foliage, will cause broader shadows.CCCXXXIX./--_Of the Horizon seen in the Water._


/By/ the sixth proposition[85], the horizon will be seen in the water
as in a looking-glass, on that side which is opposite the eye.And
if the painter has to represent a spot covered with water, let him
remember that the colour of it cannot be either lighter or darker than
that of the neighbouring objects.CCCXL./--_Of the Shadow of Bridges on the Surface of the Water._


/The/ shadows of bridges can never be seen on the surface of the water,
unless it should have lost its transparent and reflecting quality,
and become troubled and muddy; because clear water being polished and
smooth on its surface, the image of the bridge is formed in it as in
a looking-glass, and reflected in all the points situated between the
eye and the bridge at equal angles; and even the air is seen under the
arches.These circumstances cannot happen when the water is muddy,
because it does not reflect the objects any longer, but receives the
shadow of the bridge in the same manner as a dusty road would receive
it.CCCXLI./--_How a Painter ought to put in Practice the
Perspective of Colours._


/To/ put in practice that perspective which teaches the alteration, the
lessening, and even the entire loss of the very essence of colours,
you must take some points in the country at the distance of about
sixty-five yards[86] from each other; as trees, men, or some other
remarkable objects.In regard to the first tree, you will take a glass,
and having fixed that well, and also your eye, draw upon it, with the
greatest accuracy, the tree you see through it; then put it a little
on one side, and compare it closely with the natural one, and colour
it, so that in shape and colour it may resemble the original, and that
by shutting one eye they may both appear painted, and at the same
distance.The same rule may be applied to the second and third tree
at the distance you have fixed.These studies will be very useful if
managed with judgment, where they may be wanted in the offscape of a
picture.I have observed that the second tree is less by four fifths
than the first, at the distance of thirteen yards.CCCXLII./--_Various Precepts in Painting._


/The/ superficies of any opake body participates of the colour of the
transparent medium interposed between the eye and such body, in a
greater or less degree, in proportion to the density of such medium and
the space it occupies.The outlines of opake bodies will be less apparent in proportion as
those bodies are farther distant from the eye.That part of the opake body will be the most shaded, or lightest, which
is nearest to the body that shades it, or gives it light.The surface of any opake body participates more or less of the colour
of that body which gives it light, in proportion as the latter is more
or less remote, or more or less strong.Objects seen between lights and shadows will appear to have greater
relievo than those which are placed wholly in the light, or wholly in
shadow.When you give strength and precision to objects seen at a great
distance, they will appear as if they were very near.Endeavour that
your imitation be such as to give a just idea of distances.If the
object in nature appear confused in the outlines, let the same be
observed in your picture.The outlines of distant objects appear undetermined and confused,
for two reasons: the first is, that they come to the eye by so small
an angle, and are therefore so much diminished, that they strike the
sight no more than small objects do, which though near can hardly be
distinguished, such as the nails of the fingers, insects, and other
similar things: the second is, that between the eye and the distant
objects there is so much air interposed, that it becomes thick; and,
like a veil, tinges the shadows with its own whiteness, and turns them
from a dark colour to another between black and white, such as azure.Although, by reason of the great distance, the appearance of many
things is lost, yet those things which receive the light from the sun
will be more discernible, while the rest remain enveloped in confused
shadows.And because the air is thicker near the ground, the things
which are lower will appear confused; and _vice versa_.When the sun tinges the clouds on the horizon with red, those objects
which, on account of their distance, appear blueish, will participate
of that redness, and will produce a mixture between the azure and red,
which renders the prospect lively and pleasant; all the opake bodies
which receive that light will appear distinct, and of a reddish colour,
and the air, being transparent, will be impregnated with it, and appear
of the colour of lilies[87].The air which is between the earth and the sun when it rises or sets,
will always dim the objects it surrounds, more than the air any where
else, because it is whiter.It is not necessary to mark strongly the outlines of any object which
is placed upon another.If the outline or extremity of a white and curved surface terminate
upon another white body, it will have a shade at that extremity, darker
than any part of the light; but if against a dark object, such outline,
or extremity, will be lighter than any part of the light.Those objects which are most different in colour, will appear the most
detached from each other.Those parts of objects which first disappear in the distance, are
extremities similar in colour, and ending one upon the other, as the
extremities of an oak tree upon another oak similar to it.The next to
disappear at a greater distance are, objects of mixed colours, when
they terminate one upon the other, as trees, ploughed fields, walls,
heaps of rubbish, or of stones.The last extremities of bodies that
vanish are those which, being light, terminate upon a dark ground; or
being dark, upon a light ground.Of objects situated above the eye, at equal heights, the farthest
removed from the eye will appear the lowest; and if situated below
the eye, the nearest to it will appear the lowest.The parallel lines
situated sidewise will concur to one point[88].Those objects which are near a river, or a lake, in the distant part of
a landscape, are less apparent and distinct than those that are remote
from them.Of bodies of equal density, those that are nearest to the eye will
appear thinnest, and the most remote thickest.A large eye-ball will see objects larger than a small one.The
experiment may be made by looking at any of the celestial bodies,
through a pin-hole, which being capable of admitting but a portion
of its light, it seems to diminish and lose of its size in the same
proportion as the pin-hole is smaller than the usual apparent size of
the object.A thick air interposed between the eye and any object, will render the
outlines of such object undetermined and confused, and make it appear
of a larger size than it is in reality; because the linear perspective
does not diminish the angle which conveys the object to the eye.The
aerial perspective carries it farther off, so that the one removes it
from the eye, while the other preserves its magnitude[89].When the sun is in the West the vapours of the earth fall down again
and thicken the air, so that objects not enlightened by the sun remain
dark and confused, but those which receive its light will be tinged
yellow and red, according to the sun's appearance on the horizon.Again, those that receive its light are very distinct, particularly
public buildings and houses in towns and villages, because their
shadows are dark, and it seems as if those parts which are plainly seen
were coming out of confused and undetermined foundations, because at
that time every thing is of one and the same colour, except what is
enlightened by the sun[90].Any object receiving the light from the sun, receives also the general
light; so that two kinds of shadows are produced: the darkest of the
two is that which happens to have its central line directed towards the
centre of the sun.The central lines of the primitive and secondary
lights are the same as the central lines of the primitive and secondary
shadows.The setting sun is a beautiful and magnificent object when it tinges
with its colour all the great buildings of towns, villages, and the top
of high trees in the country.All below is confused and almost lost in
a tender and general mass; for, being only enlightened by the air, the
difference between the shadows and the lights is small, and for that
reason it is not much detached.But those that are high are touched
by the rays of the sun, and, as was said before, are tinged with its
colour; the painter therefore ought to take the same colour with which
he has painted the sun, and employ it in all those parts of his work
which receive its light.It also happens very often, that a cloud will appear dark without
receiving any shadow from a separate cloud, according to the situation
of the eye; because it will see only the shady part of the one, while
it sees both the enlightened and shady parts of the other.Of two objects at equal height, that which is the farthest off will
appear the lowest.Observe the first cloud in the cut, though it
is lower than the second, it appears as if it were higher.This is
demonstrated by the section of the pyramidical rays of the low cloud at
M A, and the second (which is higher) at N M, below M A. This happens
also when, on account of the rays of the setting or rising sun, a dark
cloud appears higher than another which is light.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLIII./--_The Brilliancy of a Landscape._


/The/ vivacity and brightness of colours in a landscape will never bear
any comparison with a landscape in nature when illumined by the sun,
unless the picture be placed so as to receive the same light from the
sun itself.MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.CCCXLIV./--_Why a painted Object does not appear so far distant
as a real one, though they be conveyed to the Eye by equal Angles._


[Illustration]

/If/ a house be painted on the pannel B C, at the apparent distance of
one mile, and by the side of it a real one be perceived at the true
distance of one mile also; which objects are so disposed, that the
pannel, or picture, A C, intersects the pyramidical rays with the same
opening of angles; yet these two objects will never appear of the same
size, nor at the same distance, if seen with both eyes[91].CCCXLV./--_How to draw a Figure standing upon its Feet, to
appear forty Braccia_[92] _high, in a Space of twenty Braccia, with
proportionate Members._


/In/ this, as in any other case, the painter is not to mind what kind
of surface he has to work upon; particularly if his painting is to be
seen from a determined point, such as a window, or any other opening.Because the eye is not to attend to the evenness or roughness of the
wall, but only to what is to be represented as beyond that wall; such
as a landscape, or any thing else.Nevertheless a curved surface, such
as F R G, would be the best, because it has no angles.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLVI./--_How to draw a Figure twenty-four Braccia high, upon
a Wall twelve Braccia high._ Plate XXII./Draw/ upon part of the wall M N, half the figure you mean to
represent; and the other half upon the cove above, M R. But before
that, it will be necessary to draw upon a flat board, or a paper, the
profile of the wall and cove, of the same shape and dimension, as that
upon which you are to paint.Then draw also the profile of your figure,
of whatever size you please, by the side of it; draw all the lines to
the point F, and where they intersect the profile M R, you will have
the dimensions of your figure as they ought to be drawn upon the real
spot.You will find, that on the straight part of the wall M N, it will
come of its proper form, because the going off perpendicularly will
diminish it naturally; but that part which comes upon the curve will be
diminished upon your drawing.The whole must be traced afterwards upon
the real spot, which is similar to M N. This is a good and safe method._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.CCCXLVII./--_Why, on measuring a Face, and then painting it of
the same Size, it will appear larger than the natural one._


A B is the breadth of the space, or of the head, and it is placed on
the paper at the distance C F, where the cheeks are, and it would have
to stand back all A C, and then the temples would be carried to the
distance O R of the lines A F, B F; so that there is the difference C
O and R D. It follows that the line C F, and the line D F, in order
to become shorter[93], have to go and find the paper where the whole
height is drawn, that is to say, the lines F A, and F B, where the true
size is; and so it makes the difference, as I have said, of C O, and R
D.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLVIII./--_Why the most perfect Imitation of Nature will not
appear to have the same Relief as Nature itself._


/If/ nature is seen with two eyes, it will be impossible to imitate it
upon a picture so as to appear with the same relief, though the lines,
the lights, shades, and colour, be perfectly imitated[94].It is proved
thus: let the eyes A B, look at the object C, with the concurrence of
both the central visual rays A C and B C. I say, that the sides of the
visual angles (which contain these central rays) will see the space G
D, behind the object C. The eye A will see all the space FD, and the
eye B all the space G E. Therefore the two eyes will see behind the
object C all the space F E; for which reason that object C becomes as
it were transparent, according to the definition of transparent bodies,
behind which nothing is hidden.This cannot happen if an object were
seen with one eye only, provided it be larger than the eye.From all
that has been said, we may conclude, that a painted object, occupying
all the space it has behind, leaves no possible way to see any part of
the ground, which it covers entirely by its own circumference[95].[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLIX./--_Universality of Painting; a Precept._


/A painter/ cannot be said to aim at universality in the art, unless
he love equally every species of that art.For instance, if he delight
only in landscape, his can be esteemed only as a simple investigation;
and, as our friend Botticello[96] remarks, is but a vain study; since,
by throwing a sponge impregnated with various colours against a wall,
it leaves some spots upon it, which may appear like a landscape.It is
true also, that a variety of compositions may be seen in such spots,
according to the disposition of mind with which they are considered;
such as heads of men, various animals, battles, rocky scenes, seas,
clouds, woods, and the like.It may be compared to the sound of bells,
which may seem to say whatever we choose to imagine.In the same manner
also, those spots may furnish hints for compositions, though they do
not teach us how to finish any particular part; and the imitators of
them are but sorry landscape-painters.CCCL./--_In what Manner the Mirror is the true Master of
Painters._


/When/ you wish to know if your picture be like the object you mean to
represent, have a flat looking-glass, and place it so as to reflect the
object you have imitated, and compare carefully the original with the
copy.You see upon a flat mirror the representation of things which
appear real; Painting is the same.They are both an even superficies,
and both give the idea of something beyond their superficies.Since you
are persuaded that the looking-glass, by means of lines and shades,
gives you the representation of things as if they were real; you being
in possession of colours which in their different lights and shades are
stronger than those of the looking-glass, may certainly, if you employ
the rules with judgment, give to your picture the same appearance of
Nature as you admire in the looking-glass.Or rather, your picture will
be like Nature itself seen in a large looking-glass.This looking-glass (being your master) will shew you the lights and
shades of any object whatever.Amongst your colours there are some
lighter than the lightest part of your model, and also some darker
than the strongest shades; from which it follows, that you ought to
represent Nature as seen in your looking-glass, when you look at it
with one eye only; because both eyes surround the objects too much,
particularly when they are small[97].CCCLI./--_Which Painting is to be esteemed the best._


/That/ painting is the most commendable which has the greatest
conformity to what is meant to be imitated.This kind of comparison
will often put to shame a certain description of painters, who pretend
they can mend the works of Nature; as they do, for instance, when
they pretend to represent a child twelve months old, giving him eight
heads in height, when Nature in its best proportion admits but five.The breadth of the shoulders also, which is equal to the head, they
make double, giving to a child a year old, the proportions of a man of
thirty.They have so often practised, and seen others practise these
errors, that they have converted them into habit, which has taken so
deep a root in their corrupted judgment, that they persuade themselves
that Nature and her imitators are wrong in not following their own
practice[98].CCCLII./--_Of the Judgment to be made of a Painter's Work._


/The/ first thing to be considered is, whether the figures have their
proper relief, according to their respective situations, and the light
they are in: that the shadows be not the same at the extremities of
the groups, as in the middle; because being surrounded by shadows, or
shaded only on one side, produce very different effects.The groups in
the middle are surrounded by shadows from the other figures, which are
between them and the light.Those which are at the extremities have
the shadows only on one side, and receive the light on the other.The
strongest and smartest touches of shadows are to be in the interstice
between the figures of the principal group where the light cannot
penetrate[99].Secondly, that by the order and disposition of the figures they appear
to be accommodated to the subject, and the true representation of the
history in question.Thirdly, that the figures appear alive to the occasion which brought
them together, with expressions suited to their attitudes.CCCLIII./--_How to make an imaginary Animal appear natural._


/It/ is evident that it will be impossible to invent any animal without
giving it members, and these members must individually resemble those
of some known animal.If you wish, therefore, to make a chimera, or imaginary animal, appear
natural (let us suppose a serpent); take the head of a mastiff, the
eyes of a cat, the ears of a porcupine, the mouth of a hare, the
brows of a lion, the temples of an old cock, and the neck of a sea
tortoise[100].CCCLIV./--_Painters are not to imitate one another._


/One/ painter ought never to imitate the manner of any other; because
in that case he cannot be called the child of Nature, but the
grandchild.It is always best to have recourse to Nature, which is
replete with such abundance of objects, than to the productions of
other masters, who learnt every thing from her.CCCLV./--_How to judge of one's own Work._


/It/ is an acknowledged fact, that we perceive errors in the works of
others more readily than in our own.A painter, therefore, ought to
be well instructed in perspective, and acquire a perfect knowledge of
the dimensions of the human body; he should also be a good architect,
at least as far as concerns the outward shape of buildings, with their
different parts; and where he is deficient, he ought not to neglect
taking drawings from Nature.It will be well also to have a looking-glass by him, when he paints,
to look often at his work in it, which being seen the contrary way,
will appear as the work of another hand, and will better shew his
faults.It will be useful also to quit his work often, and take some
relaxation, that his judgment may be clearer at his return; for too
great application and sitting still is sometimes the cause of many
gross errors.CCCLVI./--_Of correcting Errors which you discover._


/Remember/, that when, by the exercise of your own judgment, or the
observation of others, you discover any errors in your work, you
immediately set about correcting them, lest, in exposing your works to
the public, you expose your defects also.Admit not any self-excuse,
by persuading yourself that you shall retrieve your character, and
that by some succeeding work you shall make amends for your shameful
negligence; for your work does not perish as soon as it is out of your
hands, like the sound of music, but remains a standing monument of your
ignorance.If you excuse yourself by saying that you have not time for
the study necessary to form a great painter, having to struggle against
necessity, you yourself are only to blame; for the study of what is
excellent is food both for mind and body.How many philosophers, born
to great riches, have given them away, that they might not be retarded
in their pursuits!CCCLVII./--_The best Place for looking at a Picture._


/Let/ us suppose, that A B is the picture, receiving the light from D;
I say, that whoever is placed between C and E, will see the picture
very badly, particularly if it be painted in oil, or varnished; because
it will shine, and will appear almost of the nature of a looking-glass.For these reasons, the nearer you go towards C, the less you will be
able to see, because of the light from the window upon the picture,
sending its reflection to that point.But if you place yourself between
E D, you may conveniently see the picture, and the more so as you draw
nearer to the point D, because that place is less liable to be struck
by the reflected rays.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCLVIII./--_Of Judgment._


/There/ is nothing more apt to deceive us than our own judgment, in
deciding on our own works; and we should derive more advantage from
having our faults pointed out by our enemies, than by hearing the
opinions of our friends, because they are too much like ourselves, and
may deceive us as much as our own judgment.CCCLIX./--_Of Employment anxiously wished for by Painters._


/And/ you, painter, who are desirous of great practice, understand,
that if you do not rest it on the good foundation of Nature, you will
labour with little honour and less profit; and if you do it on a good
ground your works will be many and good, to your great honour and
advantage.CCCLX./--_Advice to Painters._


/A painter/ ought to study universal Nature, and reason much within
himself on all he sees, making use of the most excellent parts that
compose the species of every object before him.His mind will by this
method be like a mirror, reflecting truly every object placed before
it, and become, as it were, a second Nature.CCCLXI./--_Of Statuary._


/To/ execute a figure in marble, you must first make a model of it in
clay, or plaster, and when it is finished, place it in a square case,
equally capable of receiving the block of marble intended to be shaped
like it.Have some peg-like sticks to pass through holes made in the
sides, and all round the case; push them in till every one touches the
model, marking what remains of the sticks outwards with ink, and making
a countermark to every stick and its hole, so that you may at pleasure
replace them again.Then having taken out the model, and placed the
block of marble in its stead, take so much out of it, till all the pegs
go in at the same holes to the marks you had made.To facilitate the
work, contrive your frame so that every part of it, separately, or all
together, may be lifted up, except the bottom, which must remain under
the marble.By this method you may chop it off with great facility[101].CCCLXII./--_On the Measurement and Division of Statues into
Parts._


/Divide/ the head into twelve parts, each part into twelve degrees,
each degree into twelve minutes, and these minutes into seconds[102].CCCLXIII./--_A Precept for the Painter._


/The/ painter who entertains no doubt of his own ability, will attain
very little.When the work succeeds beyond the judgment, the artist
acquires nothing; but when the judgment is superior to the work, he
never ceases improving, if the love of gain do not <DW44> his progress.CCCLXIV./--_On the Judgment of Painters._


/When/ the work is equal to the knowledge and judgment of the painter,
it is a bad sign; and when it surpasses the judgment, it is still
worse, as is the case with those who wonder at having succeeded so
well.But when the judgment surpasses the work, it is a perfectly good
sign; and the young painter who possesses that rare disposition, will,
no doubt, arrive at great perfection.He will produce few works, but
they will be such as to fix the admiration of every beholder.CCCLXV./--_That a Man ought not to trust to himself, but ought
to consult Nature._


/Whoever/ flatters himself that he can retain in his memory all the
effects of Nature, is deceived, for our memory is not so capacious;
therefore consult Nature for every thing.BOOKS

and supposed to require, that the student should be a deep proficient
in perspective, before he commences the study of painting; but it is
a knowledge of the leading principles only of perspective that the
author here means, and without such a knowledge, which is easily to be
acquired, the student will inevitably fall into errors, as gross as
those humorously pointed out by Hogarth, in his Frontispiece to Kirby's
Perspective.][Footnote 3: Not to be found in this work.][Footnote 4: From this, and many other similar passages, it is evident,
that the author intended at some future time to arrange his manuscript
collections, and to publish them as separate treatises.That he did not
do so is well known; but it is also a fact, that, in selecting from the
whole mass of his collections the chapters of which the present work
consists, great care appears in general to have been taken to extract
also those to which there was any reference from any of the chapters
intended for this work, or which from their subject were necessarily
connected with them.Accordingly, the reader will find, in the notes
to this translation, that all such chapters in any other part of the
present work are uniformly pointed out, as have any relation to the
respective passages in the text.This, which has never before been
done, though indispensably necessary, will be found of singular use,
and it was thought proper here, once for all, to notice it.In the present instance the chapters, referring to the subject in the
text, are Chap.; and though these
do not afford complete information, yet it is to be remembered, that
drawing from relievos is subject to the very same rules as drawing from
Nature; and that, therefore, what is elsewhere said on that subject is
also equally applicable to this.][Footnote 5: The meaning of this is, that the last touches of light,
such as the shining parts (which are always narrow), must be given
sparingly.In short, that the drawing must be kept in broad masses as
much as possible.][Footnote 6: This is not an absolute rule, but it is a very good one
for drawing of portraits.][Footnote 9: See the two preceding chapters.][Footnote 10: Man being the highest of the animal creation, ought to be
the chief object of study.][Footnote 11: An intended Treatise, as it seems, on Anatomy, which
however never was published; but there are several chapters in the
present work on the subject of Anatomy, most of which will be found
under the present head of Anatomy; and of such as could not be placed
there, because they also related to some other branch, the following
is a list by which they may be found: Chapters vi.[Footnote 13: It does not appear that this intention was ever carried
into execution; but there are many chapters in this work on the subject
of motion, where all that is necessary for a painter in this branch
will be found.][Footnote 14: Anatomists have divided this muscle into four or five
sections; but painters, following the ancient sculptors, shew only
the three principal ones; and, in fact, we find that a greater number
of them (as may often be observed in nature) gives a disagreeable
meagreness to the subject.Beautiful nature does not shew more than
three, though there may be more hid under the skin.][Footnote 15: A treatise on weights, like many others, intended by this
author, but never published.][Footnote 17: It is believed that this treatise, like many others
promised by the author, was never written; and to save the necessity of
frequently repeating this fact, the reader is here informed, once for
all, that in the life of the author prefixed to this edition, will be
found an account of the works promised or projected by him, and how far
his intentions have been carried into effect.][Footnote 19: See in this work from chap.[Footnote 22: The author here means to compare the different quickness
of the motion of the head and the heel, when employed in the same
action of jumping; and he states the proportion of the former to be
three times that of the latter.The reason he gives for this is in
substance, that as the head has but one motion to make, while in fact
the lower part of the figure has three successive operations to perform
at the places he mentions, three times the velocity, or, in other
words, three times the degree of effort, is necessary in the head, the
prime mover, to give the power of influencing the other parts; and
the rule deducible from this axiom is, that where two different parts
of the body concur in the same action, and one of them has to perform
one motion only, while the other is to have several, the proportion of
velocity or effort in the former must be regulated by the number of
operations necessary in the latter.][Footnote 23: It is explained in this work, or at least there is
something respecting it in the preceding chapter, and in chap.[Footnote 24: The eyeball moving up and down to look at the hand,
describes a part of a circle, from every point of which it sees it
in an infinite variety of aspects.The hand also is moveable _ad
infinitum_ (for it can go round the whole circle--see chap.),
and consequently shew itself in an infinite variety of aspects, which
it is impossible for any memory to retain.][Footnote 26: About thirteen yards of our measure, the Florentine
braccia, or cubit, by which the author measures, being 1 foot 10 inches
7-8ths English measure.][Footnote 28: It is supposed that the figures are to appear of the
natural size, and not bigger.In that case, the measure of the first,
to be of the exact dimension, should have its feet resting upon the
bottom line; but as you remove it from that, it should diminish.No allusion is here intended to the distance at which a picture is to
be placed from the eye.][Footnote 29: The author does not mean here to say, that one historical
picture cannot be hung over another.It certainly may, because, in
viewing each, the spectator is at liberty (especially if they are
subjects independent of each other) to shift his place so as to stand
at the true point of sight for viewing every one of them; but in
covering a wall with a succession of subjects from the same history,
the author considers the whole as, in fact, but one picture, divided
into compartments, and to be seen at one view, and which cannot
therefore admit more than one point of sight.In the former case, the
pictures are in fact so many distinct subjects unconnected with each
other.]This chapter is obscure, and may probably be made clear by merely
stating it in other words.Leonardo objects to the use of both eyes,
because, in viewing in that manner the objects here mentioned, two
balls, one behind the other, the second is seen, which would not be
the case, if the angle of the visual rays were not too big for the
first object.Whoever is at all acquainted with optics, need not be
told, that the visual rays commence in a single point in the centre, or
nearly the centre of each eye, and continue diverging.But, in using
both eyes, the visual rays proceed not from one and the same centre,
but from a different centre in each eye, and intersecting each other,
as they do a little before passing the first object, they become
together broader than the extent of the first object, and consequently
give a view of part of the second.On the contrary, in using but one
eye, the visual rays proceed but from one centre; and as, therefore,
there cannot be any intersection, the visual rays, when they reach the
first object, are not broader than the first object, and the second is
completely hidden.Properly speaking, therefore, in using both eyes we
introduce more than one point of sight, which renders the perspective
false in the painting; but in using one eye only, there can be, as
there ought, but one point of sight.There is, however, this difference
between viewing real objects and those represented in painting, that in
looking at the former, whether we use one or both eyes, the objects,
by being actually detached from the back ground, admit the visual rays
to strike on them, so as to form a correct perspective, from whatever
point they are viewed, and the eye accordingly forms a perspective of
its own; but in viewing the latter, there is no possibility of varying
the perspective; and, unless the picture is seen precisely under the
same angle as it was painted under, the perspective in all other views
must be false.This is observable in the perspective views painted for
scenes at the playhouse.If the beholder is seated in the central line
of the house, whether in the boxes or pit, the perspective is correct;
but, in proportion as he is placed at a greater or less distance to the
right or left of that line, the perspective appears to him more or less
faulty.And hence arises the necessity of using but one eye in viewing
a painting, in order thereby to reduce it to one point of sight.][Footnote 32: See the Life of the Author prefixed, and chap.[Footnote 33: The author here speaks of unpolished Nature; and indeed
it is from such subjects only, that the genuine and characteristic
operations of Nature are to be learnt.It is the effect of education
to correct the natural peculiarities and defects, and, by so doing, to
assimilate one person to the rest of the world.][Footnote 36: See chapter cclxvii.][Footnote 37: Sir Joshua Reynolds frequently inculcated these precepts
in his lectures, and indeed they cannot be too often enforced.][Footnote 38: Probably this would have formed a part of his intended
Treatise on Light and Shadow, but no such proposition occurs in the
present work.][Footnote 41: This cannot be taken as an absolute rule; it must be left
in a great measure to the judgment of the painter.For much graceful
softness and grandeur is acquired, sometimes, by blending the lights of
the figures with the light part of the ground; and so of the shadows;
as Leonardo himself has observed in chapters cxciv.and Sir
Joshua Reynolds has often put in practice with success.][Footnote 44: He means here to say, that in proportion as the body
interposed between the eye and the object is more or less transparent,
the greater or less quantity of the colour of the body interposed will
be communicated to the object.][Footnote 45: See the note to chap.[Footnote 46: See the preceding chapter, and chap.[Footnote 47: The appearance of motion is lessened according to the
distance, in the same proportion as objects diminish in size.][Footnote 50: This was intended to constitute a part of some book of
Perspective, which we have not; but the rule here referred to will be
found in chap.[Footnote 52: No such work was ever published, nor, for any thing that
appears, ever written.][Footnote 53: The French translation of 1716 has a note on this
chapter, saying, that the invention of enamel painting found out since
the time of Leonardo da Vinci, would better answer to the title of this
chapter, and also be a better method of painting.I must beg leave,
however, to dissent from this opinion, as the two kinds of painting
are so different, that they cannot be compared.Leonardo treats of oil
painting, but the other is vitrification.Leonardo is known to have
spent a great deal of time in experiments, of which this is a specimen,
and it may appear ridiculous to the practitioners of more modern
date, as he does not enter more fully into a minute description of
the materials, or the mode of employing them.The principle laid down
in the text appears to me to be simply this: to make the oil entirely
evaporate from the colours by the action of fire, and afterwards to
prevent the action of the air by the means of a glass, which in itself
is an excellent principle, but not applicable, any more than enamel
painting to large works.][Footnote 54: It is evident that distemper or size painting is here
meant.][Footnote 56: This rule is not without exception: see chap.[Footnote 59: See chapters ccxlvii.Probably they were intended to form a part of a distinct treatise, and
to have been ranged as propositions in that, but at present they are
not so placed.][Footnote 62: Although the author seems to have designed that this, and
many other propositions to which he refers, should have formed a part
of some regular work, and he has accordingly referred to them whenever
he has mentioned them, by their intended numerical situation in that
work, whatever it might be, it does not appear that he ever carried
this design into execution.There are, however, several chapters in
the present work, viz.in which the
principle in the text is recognised, and which probably would have been
transferred into the projected treatise, if he had ever drawn it up.][Footnote 63: The note on the preceding chapter is in a great measure
applicable to this, and the proposition mentioned in the text is also
to be found in chapter ccxlvii.[Footnote 64: See the note on the chapter next but one preceding.The
proposition in the text occurs in chap.[Footnote 66: I do not know a better comment on this passage than
Felibien's Examination of Le Brun's Picture of the Tent of Darius.From this (which has been reprinted with an English translation, by
Colonel Parsons in 1700, in folio) it will clearly appear, what the
chain of connexion is between every colour there used, and its nearest
neighbour, and consequently a rule may be formed from it with more
certainty and precision than where the student is left to develope
it for himself, from the mere inspection of different examples of
colouring.]We have before remarked, that the propositions so
frequently referred to by the author, were never reduced into form,
though apparently he intended a regular work in which they were to be
included.][Footnote 68: No where in this work.][Footnote 69: This is evident in many of Vandyke's portraits,
particularly of ladies, many of whom are dressed in black velvet; and
this remark will in some measure account for the delicate fairness
which he frequently gives to the female complexion.][Footnote 70: These propositions, any more than the others mentioned
in different parts of this work, were never digested into a regular
treatise, as was evidently intended by the author, and consequently are
not to be found, except perhaps in some of the volumes of the author's
manuscript collections.][Footnote 73: This book on perspective was never drawn up.][Footnote 76: There is no work of this author to which this can at
present refer, but the principle is laid down in chapters cclxxxiv.[Footnote 77: See chapters cccvii.[Footnote 80: To our obtaining a correct idea of the magnitude and
distance of any object seen from afar, it is necessary that we consider
how much of distinctness an object loses at a distance (from the mere
interposition of the air), as well as what it loses in size; and these
two considerations must unite before we can decidedly pronounce as to
its distance or magnitude.This calculation, as to distinctness, must
be made upon the idea that the air is clear, as, if by any accident it
is otherwise, we shall (knowing the proportion in which clear air dims
a prospect) be led to conclude this farther off than it is, and, to
justify that conclusion, shall suppose its real magnitude correspondent
with the distance, at which from its degree of distinctness it appears
to be.In the circumstance remarked in the text there is, however, a
great deception; the fact is, that the colour and the minute parts of
the object are lost in the fog, while the size of it is not diminished
in proportion; and the eye being accustomed to see objects diminished
in size at a great distance, supposes this to be farther off than it
is, and consequently imagines it larger.][Footnote 81: This proposition, though undoubtedly intended to form a
part of some future work, which never was drawn up, makes no part of
the present.][Footnote 84: See chapter ccxcviii.][Footnote 85: This was probably to have been a part of some other work,
but it does not occur in this.][Footnote 86: Cento braccia, or cubits.The Florence braccio is one
foot ten inches seven eighths, English measure.][Footnote 87: Probably the Author here means yellow lilies, or fleurs
de lis.][Footnote 88: That point is always found in the horizon, and is called
the point of sight, or the vanishing point.][Footnote 91: This position has been already laid down in chapter
cxxiv.(and will also be found in chapter cccxlviii.); and the reader
is referred to the note on that passage, which will also explain that
in the text, for further illustration.It may, however, be proper to
remark, that though the author has here supposed both objects conveyed
to the eye by an angle of the same extent, they cannot, in fact, be so
seen, unless one eye be shut; and the reason is this: if viewed with
both eyes, there will be two points of sight, one in the centre of each
eye; and the rays from each of these to the objects must of course be
different, and will consequently form different angles.][Footnote 92: The braccio is one foot ten inches and seven eighths
English measure.]To be abridged according to the rules of
perspective.][Footnote 95: The whole of this chapter, like the next but one
preceding, depends on the circumstance of there being in fact two
points of sight, one in the centre of each eye, when an object is
viewed with both eyes.In natural objects the effect which this
circumstance produces is, that the rays from each point of sight,
diverging as they extend towards the object, take in not only that, but
some part also of the distance behind it, till at length, at a certain
distance behind it, they cross each other; whereas, in a painted
representation, there being no real distance behind the object, but the
whole being a flat surface, it is impossible that the rays from the
points of sight should pass beyond that flat surface; and as the object
itself is on that flat surface, which is the real extremity of the
view, the eyes cannot acquire a sight of any thing beyond.][Footnote 96: A well-known painter at Florence, contemporary with
Leonardo da Vinci, who painted several altar-pieces and other public
works.][Footnote 100: Leonardo da Vinci was remarkably fond of this kind of
invention, and is accused of having lost a great deal of time that way.][Footnote 101: The method here recommended, was the general and common
practice at that time, and continued so with little, if any variation,
till lately.But about thirty years ago, the late Mr.Bacon invented
an entirely new method, which, as better answering the purpose,
he constantly used, and from him others have also adopted it into
practice.][Footnote 102: This may be a good method of dividing the figure for the
purpose of reducing from large to small, or _vice versa_; but it not
being the method generally used by the painters for measuring their
figures, as being too minute, this chapter was not introduced amongst
those of general proportions.]One of the tables near the waffle stand is taken by a group of six
students and four girls.All of them have arrived at the table in the
last fifteen minutes--some alone, some in twos.The girl in the scarlet
gown and white kid slippers, who came with the queer-looking "type"
with the pointed beard, is Yvonne Gallois--a bonne camarade.She keeps
the rest in the best of spirits, for she is witty, this Yvonne, and a
great favorite with the crowd she is with.She is pretty, too, and has a
whole-souled good-humor about her that makes her ever welcome.The
fellow she came with is Delmet the architect--a great wag--lazy, but
full of fun--and genius.The little girl sitting opposite Yvonne is Claire Dumont.She is
explaining a very sad "histoire" to the "type" next to her, intense in
the recital of her woes.Her alert, nervous little face is a study; when
words and expression fail, she shrugs her delicate shoulders, accenting
every sentence with her hands, until it seems as if her small, nervous
frame could express no more--and all about her little dog "Loisette!"[Illustration: AT THE HEAD OF THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS]

"Yes, the villain of a concierge at Edmond's studio swore at him twice,
and Sunday, when Edmond and I were breakfasting late, the old beast saw
'Loisette' on the stairs and threw water over her; she is a sale bete,
that grosse femme!She shall see what it will cost her, the old miser;
and you know I have always been most amiable with her.She is jealous
of me--that is it--oh!Poor
'Loisette'--she shivered all night with fright and from being wet.Edmond and I are going to find another place.Yes, she shall see what it
will be there without us--with no one to depend upon for her snuff and
her wine.If she were concierge at Edmond's old atelier she would be
treated like that horrid old Madame Fouquet."The boys in the atelier over her window hated this old Madame Fouquet, I
remember.She was always prying about and complaining, so they fished up
her pet gold-fish out of the aquarium on her window-sill, and fried them
on the atelier stove, and put them back in the window on a little plate
all garnished with carrots.She swore vengeance and called in the
police, but to no avail.One day they fished up the parrot in its cage,
and the green bird that screamed and squawked continually met a speedy
and painless death and went off to the taxidermist.Then the cage was
lowered in its place with the door left ajar, and the old woman felt
sure that her pet had escaped and would some day find his way back to
her--a thing this garrulous bird would never have thought of doing had
he had any say in the matter.So the old lady left the door of the cage open for days in the event of
his return, and strange to tell, one morning Madame Fouquet got up to
quarrel with her next-door neighbor, and, to her amazement, there was
her green pet on his perch in his cage.She called to him, but he did
not answer; he simply stood on his wired legs and fixed his glassy eyes
on her, and said not a word--while the gang of Indians in the windows
above yelled themselves hoarse.It was just such a crowd as this that initiated a "nouveau" once in one
of the ateliers.They stripped the new-comer, and, as is often the
custom on similar festive occasions, painted him all over with
sketches, done in the powdered water-colors that come in glass jars.They are cheap and cover a lot of surface, so that the gentleman in
question looked like a human picture-gallery.After the ceremony, he was
put in a hamper and deposited, in the morning, in the middle of the Pont
des Arts, where he was subsequently found by the police, who carted him
off in a cab.[Illustration: THE FONTAINE DE MEDICIS]

But you must see more of this vast garden of the Luxembourg to
appreciate truly its beauty and its charm.Filled with beautiful
sculpture in bronze and marble, with its musee of famous modern pictures
bought by the Government, with flower-beds brilliant in geraniums and
fragrant in roses, with the big basin spouting a jet of water in its
center, where the children sail their boats, and with that superb
"Fontaine de Medicis" at the end of a long, rectangular basin of
water--dark as some pool in a forest brook, the green vines trailing
about its sides, shaded by the rich foliage of the trees overhead.On the other side of the Luxembourg you will find a garden of roses,
with a rich bronze group of Greek runners in the center, and near it,
back of the long marble balustrade, a croquet ground--a favorite spot
for several veteran enthusiasts who play here regularly, surrounded for
hours by an interested crowd who applaud and cheer the participants in
this passe sport.This is another way of spending an afternoon at the sole cost of one's
leisure.Often at the Punch and Judy show near-by, you will see two old
gentlemen,--who may have watched this same Punch and Judy show when they
were youngsters,--and who have been sitting for half an hour, waiting
for the curtain of the miniature theater to rise.It is popular--this
small "Theatre Guignol," and the benches in front are filled with the
children of rich and poor, who scream with delight and kick their
little, fat bare legs at the first shrill squeak of Mr.The three
who compose the staff of this tiny attraction have been long in its
service--the old harpist, and the good wife of the showman who knows
every child in the neighborhood, and her husband who is Mr.Punch, the
hangman, and the gendarme, and half a dozen other equally historical
personages.A thin, sad-looking man, this husband, gray-haired, with a
careworn look in his deep-sunken eyes, who works harder hourly, daily,
yearly, to amuse the heart of a child than almost any one I know.The little box of a theater is stifling hot in summer, and yet he must
laugh and scream and sing within it, while his good wife collects the
sous, talking all the while to this and to that child whom she has known
since its babyhood; chatting with the nurses decked out in their
gay-colored, Alsatian bows, the ribbons reaching nearly to the ground.A French nurse is a gorgeous spectacle of neatness and cleanliness, and
many of the younger ones, fresh from country homes in Normandy and
Brittany, with their rosy cheeks, are pictures of health.Wherever you
see a nurse, you will see a "piou-piou" not far away, which is a very
belittling word for the red-trousered infantryman of the Republique
Francaise.Surrounding the Palais du Luxembourg, these "piou-pious," less fortunate
for the hour, stand guard in the small striped sentry-boxes, musket at
side, or pace stolidly up and down the flagged walk.Marie, at the
moment, is no doubt with the children of the rich Count, in a shady spot
near the music.How cruel is the fate of many a gallant "piou-piou"!Farther down the gravel-walk strolls a young Frenchman and his
fiancee--the mother of his betrothed inevitably at her side!It is under
this system of rigid chaperonage that the young girl of France is given
in marriage.It is not to be wondered at that many of them marry to be
free, and that many of the happier marriages have begun with an
elopement![Illustration: THE PALACE OF THE LUXEMBOURG]

The music is over, and the band is filing out, followed by the crowd.A
few linger about the walks around the band-stand to chat.The old lady
who rents the chairs is stacking them up about the tree-trunks, and long
shadows across the walks tell of the approaching twilight.Overhead,
among the leaves, the pigeons coo.For a few moments the sun bathes
the great garden in a pinkish glow, then drops slowly, a blood-red disk,
behind the trees.The air grows chilly; it is again the hour to
dine--the hour when Paris wakes.In the smaller restaurants of the Quarter one often sees some strange
contrasts among these true bohemians, for the Latin Quarter draws its
habitues from every part of the globe.They are not all French--these
happy-go-lucky fellows, who live for the day and let the morrow slide.You will see many Japanese--some of them painters--many of them taking
courses in political economy, or in law; many of them titled men of high
rank in their own country, studying in the schools, and learning, too,
with that thoroughness and rapidity which are ever characteristic of
their race.You will find, too, Brazilians; gentlemen from Haiti of
darker hue; Russians, Poles, and Spaniards--men and women from every
clime and every station in life.They adapt themselves to the Quarter
and become a part of this big family of Bohemia easily and naturally.In this daily atmosphere only the girl-student from our own shores seems
out of place.She will hunt for some small restaurant, sacred in its
exclusiveness and known only to a dozen bon camarades of the Quarter.Perhaps this girl-student, it may be, from the West and her cousin from
the East will discover some such cosy little boite on their way back
from their atelier.To two other equally adventurous female minds they
will impart this newest find; after that you will see the four dining
there nightly together, as safe, I assure you, within these walls of
Bohemia as they would be at home rocking on their Aunt Mary's porch.There is, of course, considerable awkwardness between these bon
camarades, to whom the place really belongs, and these very innocent
new-comers, who seek a table by themselves in a corner under the few
trees in front of the small restaurant.And yet every one is exceedingly
polite to them.Madame the patronne hustles about to see that the dinner
is warm and nicely served; and Henriette, who is waiting on them, none
the less attentive, although she is late for her own dinner, which she
will sit down to presently with madame the patronne, the good cook, and
the other girls who serve the small tables.[Illustration: WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE THEATERS]

This later feast will be augmented perhaps by half the good boys and
girls who have been dining at the long table.Perhaps they will all come
in and help shell the peas for to-morrow's dinner.And yet this is a
public place, where the painters come, and where one pays only for what
one orders.It is all very interesting to the four American girls, who
are dining at the small table.But what must Mimi think of these silent and exclusive strangers, and
what, too, must the tall girl in the bicycle bloomers think, and the
little girl who has been ill and who at the moment is dining with
Renould, the artist, and whom every one--even to the cook, is so glad to
welcome back after her long illness?There is an unsurmountable barrier
between the Americans at the little table in the corner and that jolly
crowd of good and kindly people at the long one, for Mimi and Henriette
and the little girl who has been so ill, and the French painters and
sculptors with them, cannot understand either the language of these
strangers or their views of life.exclaims one of the strangers in a whisper, "do look at that
queer little 'type' at the long table--the tall girl in black actually
kissed him!"Why, my dear, I saw it plainly!"There is no law against kissing in the open air in Paris,
and besides, the tall girl in black has known the little "type" for a
Parisienne age--thirty days or less.The four innocents, who have coughed through their soup and whispered
through the rest of the dinner, have now finished and are leaving, but
if those at the long table notice their departure, they do not show it.In the Quarter it is considered the height of rudeness to stare.You
will find these Suzannes and Marcelles exceedingly well-bred in the
little refinements of life, and you will note a certain innate dignity
and kindliness in their bearing toward others, which often makes one
wish to uncover his head in their presence.CHAPTER IX

"THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE QUARTER"


There are many streets of the Quarter as quiet as those of a country
village.Some of them, like the rue Vaugirard, lead out past gloomy
slaughter-houses and stables, through desolate sections of vacant
lots, littered with the ruins of factory and foundry whose tall,
smoke-begrimed chimneys in the dark stand like giant sentries, as if
pointing a warning finger to the approaching pedestrian, for these
ragged edges of the Quarter often afford at night a lurking-ground for
footpads.In just such desolation there lived a dozen students, in a small nest of
studios that I need not say were rented to them at a price within their
ever-scanty means.It was marveled at among the boys in the Quarter that
any of these exiles lived to see the light of another day, after
wandering back at all hours of the night to their stronghold.Possibly their sole possessions consisted of the clothes they had on, a
few bad pictures, and their several immortal geniuses.That the
gentlemen with the sand-bags knew of this I am convinced, for the
students were never molested.Verily, Providence lends a strong and
ready arm to the drunken man and the fool!The farther out one goes on the rue Vaugirard, the more desolate
and forbidding becomes this long highway, until it terminates at
the fortifications, near which is a huge, open field, kept clear
of such permanent buildings as might shelter an enemy in time of
war.Scattered over this space are the hovels of squatters and
gipsies--fortune-telling, horse-trading vagabonds, whose living-vans
at certain times of the year form part of the smaller fairs within
the Quarter.[Illustration: (factory chimneys along empty street)]

And very small and unattractive little fairs they are, consisting of
half a dozen or more wagons, serving as a yearly abode for these
shiftless people; illumined at night by the glare of smoking oil
torches.There is, moreover, a dingy tent with a half-drawn red curtain
that hides the fortune-telling beauty; and a traveling shooting-gallery,
so short that the muzzle of one's rifle nearly rests upon the painted
lady with the sheet-iron breastbone, centered by a pinhead of a
bull's-eye which never rings.There is often a small carousel, too,
which is not only patronized by the children, but often by a crowd of
students--boys and girls, who literally turn the merry-go-round into a
circus, and who for the time are cheered to feats of bareback riding by
the enthusiastic bystanders.These little Quarter fetes are far different from the great fete de
Neuilly across the Seine, which begins at the Porte Maillot, and
continues in a long, glittering avenue of side-shows, with mammoth
carousels, bizarre in looking-glass panels and golden figures.Within
the circle of all this throne-like gorgeousness, a horse-power organ
shakes the very ground with its clarion blasts, while pink and white
wooden pigs, their tails tied up in bows of colored ribbons, heave and
swoop round and round, their backs loaded with screaming girls and
shouting men.It was near this very same Port Maillot, in a colossal theater, built
originally for the representation of one of the Kiralfy ballets, that a
fellow student and myself went over from the Quarter one night to "supe"
in a spectacular and melodramatic pantomime, entitled "Afrique a Paris."We were invited by the sole proprietor and manager of the show--an
old circus-man, and one of the shrewdest, most companionable, and
intelligent of men, who had traveled the world over.He spoke no
language but his own unadulterated American.This, with his dominant
personality, served him wherever fortune carried him!So, accepting his invitation to play alternately the dying soldier and
the pursuing cannibal under the scorching rays of a tropical limelight,
and with an old pair of trousers and a flannel shirt wrapped in a
newspaper, we presented ourselves at the appointed hour, at the edge of
the hostile country.[Illustration: (street scene)]

Here we found ourselves surrounded by a horde of savages who needed no
greasepaint to stain their ebony bodies, and many of whose grinning
countenances I had often recognized along our own Tenderloin.Besides,
there were cowboys and "greasers" and diving elks, and a company of
French Zouaves; the latter, in fact, seemed to be the only thing foreign
about the show.Our friend, the manager, informed us that he had thrown
the entire spectacle together in about ten days, and that he had
gathered with ease, in two, a hundred of those dusky warriors, who had
left their coat-room and barber-shop jobs in New York to find themselves
stranded in Paris.He was a hustler, this circus-man, and preceding the spectacle of the
African war, he had entertained the audience with a short variety-show,
to brace the spectacle.He insisted on bringing us around in front and
giving us a box, so we could see for ourselves how good it really was.During this forepart, and after some clever high trapeze work,
the sensation of the evening was announced--a Signore, with an
unpronounceable name, would train a den of ten forest-bred lions!When the orchestra had finished playing "The Awakening of the Lion," the
curtain rose, disclosing the nerveless Signore in purple tights and
high-topped boots.A long, portable cage had been put together on the
stage during the intermission, and within it the ten pacing beasts.There is something terrifying about the roar of a lion as it begins with
its high-keyed moan, and descends in scale to a hoarse roar that seems
to penetrate one's whole nervous system.But the Signore did not seem to mind it; he placed one foot on the sill
of the safety-door, tucked his short riding-whip under his arm, pulled
the latch with one hand, forced one knee in the slightly opened door,
and sprang into the cage.went the iron door as it found its
lock.went the Signore's revolver, as he drove the snarling,
roaring lot into the corner of the cage.The smoke from his revolver
drifted out through the bars; the house was silent.The trainer walked
slowly up to the fiercest lion, who reared against the bars as he
approached him, striking at the trainer with his heavy paws, while the
others slunk into the opposite corner.The man's head was but half a
foot now from the lion's; he menaced the beast with the little
riding-whip; he almost, but did not quite strike him on the tip of his
black nose that worked convulsively in rage.Then the lion dropped
awkwardly, with a short growl, to his forelegs, and slunk, with the
rest, into the corner.It was the little
riding-whip they feared, for they had never gauged its sting.Not the
heavy iron bar within reach of his hand, whose force they knew."An ugly lot," I said, turning to our friend the manager, who had taken
his seat beside me."Yes," he mused, peering at the stage with his keen gray eyes; "green
stock, but a swell act, eh?I've got a
girl here who comes on and does art poses among the lions; she's a
dream--French, too!"A girl of perhaps twenty, enveloped in a bath gown, now appeared at the
wings.The next instant the huge theater became dark, and she stood in
full fleshings, in the center of the cage, brilliant in the rays of a
powerful limelight, while the lions circled about her at the command of
the trainer."Yes," said I, "she is.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

"No, she never worked with the cats before," he said; "she's new to the
show business; she said her folks live in Nantes.She worked here in a
chocolate factory until she saw my 'ad' last week and joined my show.We
gave her a rehearsal Monday and we put her on the bill next night.She's
a good looker with plenty of grit, and is a winner with the bunch in
front.""How did you get her to take the job?""Well," he replied, "she balked at the act at first, but I showed her
two violet notes from a couple of swell fairies who wanted the job, and
after that she signed for six weeks."he exclaimed dryly, and he bit the corner of his stubby
mustache and smiled."This is the last act in the olio, so you will have
to excuse me.*     *     *     *     *

There are streets and boulevards in the Quarter, sections of which are
alive with the passing throng and the traffic of carts and omnibuses.Then one will come to a long stretch of massive buildings, public
institutions, silent as convents--their interminable walls flanking
garden or court.Germain is just such a highway until it crosses the
Boulevard St.Michel--the liveliest roadway of the Quarter.Then it
seems to become suddenly inoculated with its bustle and life, and from
there on is crowded with bourgeoise and animated with the commerce of
market and shop.An Englishman once was so fired with a desire to see the gay life of the
Latin Quarter that he rented a suite of rooms on this same Boulevard St.Germain at about the middle of this long, quiet stretch.Here he stayed
a fortnight, expecting daily to see from his "chambers" the gaiety of a
Bohemia of which he had so often heard.At the end of his disappointing
sojourn, he returned to London, firmly convinced that the gay life of
the Latin Quarter was a myth.[Illustration: (crowded street market)]

But the man from Denver, the "Steel King," and the two thinner
gentlemen with the louis-lined waistcoats who accompanied him and whom
Fortune had awakened in the far West one morning and had led them to
"The Great Red Star copper mine"--a find which had ever since been a
source of endless amusement to them--discovered the Quarter before they
had been in Paris a day, and found it, too, "the best ever," as they
expressed it.They did not remain long in Paris, this rare crowd of seasoned genials,
for it was their first trip abroad and they had to see Switzerland and
Vienna, and the Rhine; but while they stayed they had a good time Every
Minute.The man from Denver and the Steel King sat at one of the small tables,
leaning over the railing at the "Bal Bullier," gazing at the sea of
dancers."Billy," said the man from Denver to the Steel King, "if they had this
in Chicago they'd tear out the posts inside of fifteen minutes"--he
wiped the perspiration from his broad forehead and pushed his
twenty-dollar Panama on the back of his head.he mused, clinching the butt of his perfecto between
his teeth.it beats all I ever see," and he chuckled to
himself, his round, genial face, with its double chin, wreathed in
smiles.he called to one of the 'copper twins,' "did you get on
to that little one in black that just went by--well!Already the pile of saucers on their table reached a foot high--a record
of refreshments for every Yvonne and Marcelle that had stopped in
passing."Certainly, sit right down," cried the Steel King."Here, Jack,"--this
to the aged garcon, "smoke up!and ask the ladies what they'll
have"--all of which was unintelligible to the two little Parisiennes and
the garcon, but quite clear in meaning to all three.interrupted the taller of the two girls, "un cafe
glace pour moi.""Et moi," answered her companion gayly, "Je prends une limonade!"thundered good-humoredly the man from Denver; "git 'em
a good drink.yes, that's it--whiskey--I see you're on,
and two.he explains, holding up two fat fingers, "all straight,
friend--two whiskeys with seltzer on the side--see?Now go roll your
hoop and git back with 'em.""Oh, non, monsieur!"cried the two Parisiennes in one breath; "whiskey!ca pique et c'est trop fort."At this juncture the flower woman arrived with a basketful of red roses."Voulez-vous des fleurs, messieurs et mesdames?""Certainly," cried the Steel King; "here, Maud and Mamie, take the lot,"
and he handed the two girls the entire contents of the basket.The
taller buried her face for a moment in the red Jaqueminots and drank in
their fragrance.When she looked up, two big tears trickled down to the
corners of her pretty mouth.The
smaller girl gave a little cry of delight and shook her roses above her
head as three other girls passed.Ten minutes later the two possessed
but a single rose apiece--they had generously given all the rest away.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

The "copper twins" had been oblivious of all this.They had been hanging
over the low balustrade, engaged in a heart-to-heart talk with two
pretty Quartier brunettes.It seemed to be really a case of love at
first sight, carried on somewhat under difficulties, for the "copper
twins" could not speak a word of French, and the English of the two chic
brunettes was limited to "Oh, yes!""Good morning," "Good
evening," and "I love you."The four held hands over the low railing,
until the "copper twins" fairly steamed in talk; warmed by the sun of
gaiety and wet by several rounds of Highland dew, they grew sad and
earnest, and got up and stepped all over the Steel King and the man from
Denver, and the two Parisiennes' daintily slippered feet, in squeezing
out past the group of round tables back of the balustrade, and down on
to the polished floor--where they are speedily lost to view in the maze
of dancers, gliding into the whirl with the two brunettes.When the
waltz is over they stroll out with them into the garden, and order wine,
and talk of changing their steamer date.The good American, with his spotless collar and his well-cut clothes,
with his frankness and whole-souled generosity, is a study to the modern
grisette.He seems strangely attractive to her, in contrast with a
certain type of Frenchman, that is selfish, unfaithful, and mean--that
jealousy makes uncompanionable and sometimes cruel.She will tell you
that these pale, black-eyed, and black-bearded boulevardiers are all
alike--lazy and selfish; so unlike many of the sterling, good fellows of
the Quarter--Frenchmen of a different stamp, and there are many of
these--rare, good Bohemians, with hearts and natures as big as all
out-doors--"bons garcons," which is only another way of saying
"gentlemen."As you tramp along back to your quarters some rainy night you find many
of the streets leading from the boulevards silent and badly lighted,
except for some flickering lantern on the corner of a long block which
sends the shadows scurrying across your path.You pass a student perhaps
and a girl, hurrying home--a fiacre for a short distance is a luxury in
the Quarter.Now you hear the click-clock of an approaching cab, the
cocher half asleep on his box.The hood of the fiacre is up, sheltering
the two inside from the rain.As the voiture rumbles by near a
street-light, you catch a glimpse of a pink silk petticoat within and a
pair of dainty, white kid shoes--and the glint of an officer's sword.Farther on, you pass a silent gendarme muffled in his night cloak; a few
doors farther on in a small cafe, a bourgeois couple, who have arrived
on a late train no doubt to spend a month with relatives in Paris, are
having a warming tipple before proceeding farther in the drizzling rain.They have, of course, invited the cocher to drink with them.They have
brought all their pets and nearly all their household goods--two dogs,
three bird-cages, their tiny occupants protected from the damp air by
several folds of newspaper; a cat in a stout paper box with air holes,
and two trunks, well tied with rope.[Illustration: (street market)]

"Ah, yes, it has been a long journey!"Her husband
corroborates her, as they explain to the patronne of the cafe and to the
cocher that they left their village at midday.Anything over two hours
on the chemin-de-fer is considered a journey by these good French
people!As you continue on to your studio, you catch a glimpse of the lights of
the Boulevard Montparnasse.Next a cab with a green light rattles by;
then a ponderous two-wheeled cart lumbers along, piled high with red
carrots as neatly arranged as cigars in a box--the driver asleep on his
seat near his swinging lantern--and the big Normandy horses taking the
way.It is late, for these carts are on their route to the early morning
market--one of the great Halles.The tired waiters are putting up the
shutters of the smaller cafes and stacking up the chairs.Now a cock
crows lustily in some neighboring yard; the majority at least of the
Latin Quarter has turned in for the night.A moment later you reach your
gate, feel instinctively for your matches.In the darkness of the court
a friendly cat rubs her head contentedly against your leg.It is the
yellow one that sleeps in the furniture factory, and you pick her up and
carry her to your studio, where, a moment later, she is crunching
gratefully the remnant of the beau maquereau left from your
dejeuner--for charity begins at home.CHAPTER X

EXILED


Scores of men, celebrated in art and in literature, have, for a longer
or shorter period of their lives, been bohemians of the Latin Quarter.And yet these years spent in cafes and in studios have not turned them
out into the world a devil-me-care lot of dreamers.They have all
marched and sung along the "Boul' Miche"; danced at the "Bullier";
starved, struggled, and lived in the romance of its life.It has all
been a part of their education, and a very important part too, in the
development of their several geniuses, a development which in later life
has placed them at the head of their professions.These years of
camaraderie--of a life free from all conventionalities, in daily touch
with everything about them, and untrammeled by public censure or the
petty views of prudish or narrow minds, have left them free to cut a
straight swath merrily toward the goal of their ideals, surrounded all
the while by an atmosphere of art and good-fellowship that permeates the
very air they breathe.If a man can work at all, he can work here, for between the
working-hours he finds a life so charming, that once having lived
it he returns to it again and again, as to an old love.How many are the romances of this student Quarter!How many hearts have
been broken or made glad!How many brave spirits have suffered and
worked on and suffered again, and at last won fame!We who come with a fresh eye know nothing of all that has passed
within these quaint streets--only those who have lived in and through it
know its full story.[Illustration: THE MUSEE CLUNY]

Pochard has seen it; so has the little old woman who once danced at the
opera; so have old Bibi La Puree, and Alphonse, the gray-haired garcon,
and Mere Gaillard, the flower-woman.They have seen the gay boulevards
and the cafes and generations of grisettes, from the true grisette of
years gone by, in her dainty white cap and simple dress turned low at
the throat, to the tailor-made grisette of to-day.Yet the eyes of the little old woman still dance; they have not grown
tired of this ever-changing kaleidoscope of human nature, this paradise
of the free, where many would rather struggle on half starved than live
a life of luxury elsewhere.I knew one once who lived in an
air-castle of his own building--a tall, serious fellow, a sculptor, who
always went tramping about in a robe resembling a monk's cowl, with his
bare feet incased in coarse sandals; only his art redeemed these
eccentricities, for he produced in steel and ivory the most exquisite
statuettes.One at the Salon was the sensation of the day--a knight in
full armor, scarcely half a foot in height, holding in his arms a nymph
in flesh-tinted ivory, whose gentle face, upturned, gazed sweetly into
the stern features behind the uplifted vizor; and all so exquisitely
carved, so alive, so human, that one could almost feel the tender heart
of this fair lady beating against the cold steel breastplate.Another "bon garcon"--a painter whose enthusiasm for his art knew no
bounds--craved to produce a masterpiece.This dreamer could be seen
daily ferreting around the Quarter for a studio always bigger than the
one he had.At last he found one that exactly fitted the requirements of
his vivid imagination--a studio with a ceiling thirty feet high, with
windows like the scenic ones next to the stage entrances of the
theaters.Here at last he could give full play to his brush--no subject
seemed too big for him to tackle; he would move in a canvas as big as a
back flat to a third act, and commence on a "Fall of Babylon" or a
"Carnage of Rome" with a nerve that was sublime!The choking dust of the
arena--the insatiable fury of the tigers--the cowering of hundreds of
unfortunate captives--and the cruel multitude above, seated in the vast
circle of the hippodrome--all these did not daunt his zeal.Once he persuaded a venerable old abbe to pose for his portrait.The
old gentleman came patiently to his studio and posed for ten days, at
the end of which time the abbe gazed at the result and said things which
I dare not repeat--for our enthusiast had so far only painted his
clothes; the face was still in its primary drawing."The face I shall do in time," the enthusiast assured the reverend man
excitedly; "it is the effect of the rich color of your robe I wished to
get.And may I ask your holiness to be patient a day longer while I put
in your boots?""Does monsieur think I am not a
very busy man?"Then softening a little, he said, with a smile:

"I won't come any more, my friend.I'll send my boots around to-morrow
by my boy."But the longest red-letter day has its ending, and time and tide beckon
one with the brutality of an impatient jailer.On my studio table is a well-stuffed envelope containing the documents
relative to my impending exile--a stamped card of my identification,
bearing the number of my cell, a plan of the slave-ship, and six red
tags for my baggage.The three pretty daughters of old Pere Valois know of my approaching
departure, and say cheering things to me as I pass the concierge's
window.Pere Valois stands at the gate and stops me with: "Is it true, monsieur,
you are going Saturday?""Yes," I answer; "unfortunately, it is quite true."The old man sighs and replies: "I once had to leave Paris myself";
looking at me as if he were speaking to an old resident."My regiment
was ordered to the colonies.It was hard, monsieur, but I did my duty."The patron of the tobacco-shop,
and madame his good wife, and the wine merchant, and the baker along the
little street with its cobblestone-bed, have all wished me "bon voyage,"
accompanied with many handshakings.It is getting late and Pere Valois
has gone to hunt for a cab--a "galerie," as it is called, with a place
for trunks on top.Twenty minutes go by, but no "galerie" is in sight.The three daughters of Pere Valois run in different directions to find
one, while I throw the remaining odds and ends in the studio into my
valise.At last there is a sound of grating wheels below on the gravel
court.The "galerie" has arrived--with the smallest of the three
daughters inside, all out of breath from her run and terribly excited.There are the trunks and the valises and the bicycle in its crate to get
down.Two soldiers, who have been calling on two of the daughters, come
up to the studio and kindly offer their assistance.There is no time to
lose, and in single file the procession starts down the atelier stairs,
headed by Pere Valois, who has just returned from his fruitless search
considerably winded, and the three girls, the two red-trousered soldiers
and myself tugging away at the rest of the baggage.It is not often one departs with the assistance of three pretty femmes
de menage, a jolly old concierge, and a portion of the army of the
French Republic.With many suggestions from my good friends and an
assuring wave of the hand from the aged cocher, my luggage is roped and
chained to the top of the rickety, little old cab, which sways and
squeaks with the sudden weight, while the poor, small horse, upon whom
has been devolved the task of making the 11.35 train, Gare St.Lazare,
changes his position wearily from one leg to the other.He is evidently
thinking out the distance, and has decided upon his gait.cry the three girls and Pere Valois and the two soldiers,
as the last trunk is chained on.The dingy vehicle groans its way slowly out of the court.Just as it
reaches the last gate it stops.I ask, poking my head out of the window."Monsieur," says the aged cocher, "it is an impossibility!I regret very
much to say that your bicycle will not pass through the gate."A dozen heads in the windows above offer suggestions.I climb out and
take a look; there are at least four inches to spare on either side in
passing through the iron posts.cries my cocher enthusiastically, "monsieur is right, happily for
us!"He cracks his whip, the little horse gathers itself together--a moment
of careful driving and we are through and into the street and rumbling
away, amid cheers from the windows above.As I glance over my traps, I
see a small bunch of roses tucked in the corner of my roll of rugs with
an engraved card attached."From Mademoiselle Ernestine Valois," it
reads, and on the other side is written, in a small, fine hand, "Bon
voyage."I look back to bow my acknowledgment, but it is too late; we have turned
the corner and the rue Vaugirard is but a memory!*     *     *     *     *

But why go on telling you of what the little shops contain--how narrow
and picturesque are the small streets--how gay the boulevards--what they
do at the "Bullier"--or where they dine?It is Love that moves Paris--it
is the motive power of this big, beautiful, polished city--the love of
adventure, the love of intrigue, the love of being a bohemian if you
will--but it is Love all the same!"I work for love," hums the little couturiere."I work for love," cries the miller of Marcel Legay."I live for love," sings the poet."For the love of art I am a painter," sighs Edmond, in his atelier--"and
for her!""For the love of it I mold and model and create," chants the
sculptor--"and for her!"It is the Woman who dominates Paris--"Les petites femmes!"who have
inspired its art through the skill of these artisans.cries a poor old
woman outside of your train compartment, as you are leaving Havre for
Paris.screams a girl, running near the open window with a little
fishergirl doll uplifted.I see," cries the
pretty vendor; "but it is a boy doll--he will be sad if he goes to
Paris without a companion!"Take all the little fishergirls away from Paris--from the Quartier
Latin--and you would find chaos and a morgue!that is it--L'amour!--L'amour!--L'amour![Illustration: (burning candle)]

          last I cried out, 'Oh Bill, my mate, whar be you?'an' I hearn a fibble v'ice say, 'Here I be,
          Jerry!'I wor gladder nor anything wen I hearn
          that.I hugged him to my heart, I wor moved so
          powerful, an' then I tuck him on my back, an' off
          to camp; werry slow an' patient, fur he were sore
          wownded, an' the life in him wery low."Wall, young genl'men, I'll not weary you wi' the
          long hours as dragged by afore mornin'.I med him

          to my lad; but at last the relief kim roun', an'
          the man as was to take my place says, says he,
          'Jerry, my mate, ef I was you I'd go right to the
          hosp'tl an' stay by poor Bill' (fur they all knew
          as I sot gret store by him); 'He is werry wild in
          his head, I hearn, an' the sugeon says as how he
          can't last long.'"Ye may b'lieve how my hairt jumped wen I hearn
          that.I laid down my gun, an' ran fur the wooden
          shed, which were all the place they hed fur them
          as was wownded.An' thar wor Bill--my mate
          Bill--laying on a blanket spred on the floore, wi'
          his clothes all on (fur it's a hard bed, an' his
          own bloody uniform, that a sojer must die in), wi'
          the corpse o' another poor fellow as had died all
          alone in the night a'most touching him, an'
          slopped wi' blood.I moved it fur away all in a
          trimble o' sorrer, an' kivered it decent like, so
          as Bill mightn't see it an' get downhearted fur
          hisself.Then I went an' sot down aside my mate.He didn't know me, no more nor if I wor a
          stranger; but kept throwin' his arms about, an'
          moanin' out continual, 'Oh mother!Why
          don't you come to your boy?'"I bust right out crying, I do own, wen I hearn
          that, an' takin' his han' in mine, I tried to
          quiet him down a bit; telling him it wor bad fur
          his wownd to be so res'less (fur every time he
          tossed, thar kim a little leap o' blood from his
          breast); an' at last, about foore o'clock in the
          day, he opened his eyes quite sensible like, an'
          says to me, he says, 'Dear matey, is that you?Thank you fur coming to see me afore I die.'"'No, Bill, don't talk so,' I says, a strivin' to
          be cheerful like, tho' I seed death in his face,
          'You'll be well afore long.'"'Aye, well in heaven,' he says; and then, arter a
          minnit, 'Jerry,' he says, 'thar's a little bounty
          money as belongs to me in my knapsack, an' my
          month's wages.I want you, wen I am gone, to take
          it to my mother, an' tell her--'(he wor gaspin'
          fearful)--'as I died--fightin' fur my country--an'
          the flag.God bless you, Jerry--you hev been a
          good frien' to me, an' I knows as you'll do
          this--an' bid the boys good-by--fur me.'"I promised, wi' the tears streamin' down my
          cheeks; an' then we wor quiet a bit, fur it hurt
          Bill's breast to talk, an' I could not say a wured
          fur the choke in my throat.Arter a while he says,
          'Jerry, won't you sing me the hymn as I taught you
          aboard the transport?"I could hardly find v'ice to begin, but it wor
          Bill's dying wish, an' I made shift to sing as
          well as I could--

          "'We air marchin' on together
              To our etarnal rest;
           Niver askin' why we're ordered--
             For the Lord He knoweth best.is His word;
           Ranks all steady, muskets ready,
             In the army o' the Lord!"'Satan's hosts are all aroun' us,
             An' strive to enter in;
           But our outworks they are stronger
             Nor the dark brigades o' sin!Righteousness our sword;
           Truth the standard--in the vanguard--
             O' the army o' the Lord!"'Comrads, we air ever fightin'
             A battle fur the right;
           Ever on the on'ard movement
             Fur our home o' peace an' light.Heaven our reward,
          Comin' nearer, shinin' clearer--
             In the army o' the Lord!'"Arter I hed sung the hymn--an' it wor all I could
          do to get through--Bill seemed to be a sight
          easier.He lay still, smilin' like a child on the
          mother's breast.Pretty soon arter, the Major kim
          in; an' wen he seed Bill lookin' so peaceful, he
          says, says he, 'Why, cheer up, my lad!the sugeon
          sayd as how you wor in a bad way; but you look
          finely now;'--fur he didn't know it wor the death
          look coming over him.'You'll be about soon,'
          says the Major, 'an' fightin' fur the flag as
          brave as ever,'

          "Bill didn't say nothing--he seemed to be getting
          wild agin;--an' looked stupid like at our Major
          till he hearn the wureds about the flag.Then he
          caught his breath suddint like, an', afore we
          could stop him, he had sprang to his feet--shakin'
          to an' fro like a reed--but as straight as he ever
          wor on parade; an', his v'ice all hoarse an' full
          o' death, an' his arm in the air, he shouted,
          'Aye!we'll fight fur it
          till--' an' then we hearn a sort o' snap, an' he
          fell forred--dead!"We buried him that night, I an' my mates.I cut
          off a lock o' his hair fur his poor mother, afore
          we put the airth over him; an' giv it to her, wi'
          poor Bill's money, faithful an' true, wen we kim
          home.I've lived to be an old man since then, an'
          see the Major go afore me, as I hoped to sarve
          till my dyin' day; but Lord willing I shel go
          next, to win the Salwation as I've fitten for, by
          Bill's side, a sojer in Christ's army, in the
          Etarnal Jerusalem!"The boys took a long breath when Jerry had finished his story, and more
than one bright eye was filled with tears.The rough words, and plain,
unpolished manner of the old soldier, only heightened the impression
made by his story; and as he rose to go away, evidently much moved by
the painful recollections it excited, there was a hearty, "Thank you,
sergeant, for your story--it was real good!"Jerry only touched his cap
to the young soldiers, and marched off hastily, while the boys looked
after him in respectful silence.But young spirits soon recover from
gloomy influences, and in a few moments they were all chattering merrily
again."What a pity we must go home Monday!"cried Louie; "I wish we could camp
out forever!Oh, Freddy, do write a letter to General McClellan, and ask
him to let us join the army right away!Tell him we'll buy some new
india-rubber back-bones and stretch ourselves out big directly, if he'll
only send right on for us!""Perhaps he would, if he knew how jolly we can drill already!""I tell you what, boys, the very thing!let's have a
review before we go home.I'll ask all the boys and girls I know to come
and look on, and we might have quite a grand entertainment.We can march about all over, and fire off the cannons and
everything!"Yes, but how's General McClellan to hear anything about it?""Why--I don't know," said Peter, rather taken aback by this view of the
subject."Well, somehow--never mind, it will be grand fun, and I mean
to ask my father right away."Finally it was
concluded that it might make more impression on Mr.Schermerhorn's mind,
if the application came from the regiment in a body; so, running for
their swords and guns, officers and men found their places in the
battalion, and the grand procession started on its way--chattering all
the time, in utter defiance of that "article of war" which forbids
"talking in the ranks."Just as they were passing the lake, they heard
carriage wheels crunching on the gravel, and drew up in a long line on
the other side of the road to let the vehicle pass them; much to the
astonishment of two pretty young ladies and a sweet little girl, about
Freddy's age, who were leaning comfortably back in the handsome
barouche.exclaimed one of the ladies, "what in the world is all
this?"cried Peter, running up to the carriage, "why, these are the
Dashahed Zouaves, Miss Carlton.Good morning, Miss Jessie," to the little girl on the front seat, who
was looking on with deep interest."Oh, to be sure, I remember," said Miss Carlton, laughing; "come,
introduce the Zouaves, Peter; we are wild to know them!"The boys clustered eagerly about the carriage and a lively chat took
place.The Zouaves, some blushing and bashful, others frank and
confident, and all desperately in love already with pretty little
Jessie, related in high glee their adventures--except the celebrated
court martial--and enlarged glowingly upon the all-important subject of
the grand review.Colonel Freddy, of course, played a prominent part in all this, and with
his handsome face, bright eyes, and frank, gentlemanly ways, needed only
those poor lost curls to be a perfect picture of a soldier.He chattered
away with Miss Lucy, the second sister, and obtained her special promise
that she would plead their cause with Mr.Schermerhorn in case the
united petitions of the corps should fail.The young ladies did not know
of Mrs.Schermerhorn's departure, but Freddy and Peter together coaxed
them to come up to the house "anyhow."The carriage was accordingly
taken into the procession, and followed it meekly to the house; the
Zouaves insisting on being escort, much to the terror of the young
ladies; who were in constant apprehension that the rear rank and the
horses might come to kicks--not to say blows--and the embarrassment of
the coachman; who, as they were constantly stopping unexpectedly to turn
round and talk, didn't know "where to have them," as the saying is.However, they reached their destination in safety before long, and
found Mr.Schermerhorn seated on the piazza.He hastened forward to meet
them, with the cordial greeting of an old friend."Well, old bachelor," said Miss Carlton, gayly, as the young ladies
ascended the steps, "you see we have come to visit you in state, with
the military escort befitting patriotic young ladies who have four
brothers on the Potomac."Gone to Niagara and left me a 'lone lorn creetur;'" said Mr."Basely deserted me when my farming couldn't be
left.But how am I to account for the presence of the military,
mademoiselle?""Really, I beg their pardons," exclaimed Miss Carlton."They have come
on a special deputation to you, Mr.Schermerhorn, so pray don't let us
interrupt business."Thus apostrophised, the boys scampered eagerly up the steps; and Freddy,
a little bashful, but looking as bright as a button, delivered the
following brief oration: "Mr.Schermerhorn: I want--that is, the boys
want--I mean we all want--to have a grand review on Saturday, and ask
our friends to look on.Schermerhorn,
smiling; "but what will become of you good people when I tell you that
I have just received a letter from Mrs.Schermerhorn, asking me to join
her this week instead of next, and bring Peter with me."interrupted Peter; "can't you tell ma
I've joined the army for the war?"No, the army
must give you up, and lose a valuable member, Master Peter; but just
have the goodness to listen a moment.The review shall take place, but
as the camp will have to break up on Saturday instead of Monday, as I
had intended, the performances must come off to-morrow.The boys gave a delighted consent to this arrangement, and now the only
thing which dampened their enjoyment was the prospect of such a speedy
end being put to their camp life.what was the fun for a
fellow to be poked into a stupid watering place, where he must bother to
keep his hair parted down the middle, and a clean collar stiff enough to
choke him on from morning till night?"as Tom indignantly remarked to
George and Will the same evening."The fact is, this sort of thing is
_the_ thing for a _man_ after all!"an opinion in which the other _men_
fully concurred.But let us return to the piazza, where we have left the party.After a
few moments more spent in chatting with Mr.Schermerhorn, it was decided
to accept Colonel Freddy's polite invitation, which he gave with such a
bright little bow, to inspect the camp.You may be sure it was in
apple-pie order, for Jerry, who had taken the Zouaves under his special
charge, insisted on their keeping it in such a state of neatness as only
a soldier ever achieved.The party made an extremely picturesque
group--the gay uniforms of the Zouaves, and light summer dresses of the
ladies, charmingly relieved against the background of trees; while Mr.Schermerhorn's stately six feet, and somewhat portly proportions, quite
reminded one of General Scott; especially among such a small army; in
which George alone quite came up to the regulation "63 inches."Little Jessie ran hither and thither, surrounded by a crowd of adorers,
who would have given their brightest buttons, every "man" of them, to be
the most entertaining fellow of the corps.They showed her the battery
and the stacks of shining guns--made to stand up by Jerry in a wonderful
fashion that the boys never could hope to attain--the inside of all the
tents, and the smoke guard house (Tom couldn't help a blush as he looked
in); and finally, as a parting compliment (which, let me tell you, is
the greatest, in a boy's estimation, that can possibly be paid), Freddy
made her a present of his very largest and most gorgeous "glass agates;"
one of which was all the colors of the rainbow, and the other
patriotically adorned with the Stars and Stripes in enamel.Peter
climbed to the top of the tallest cherry tree, and brought her down a
bough at least a yard and a half long, crammed with "ox hearts;" Harry
eagerly offered to make any number of "stunning baskets" out of the
stones, and in short there never was such a belle seen before."Oh, a'int she jolly!"was the ruling opinion among the Zouaves.A
private remark was also circulated to the effect that "Miss Jessie was
stunningly pretty."The young ladies at last said good-by to the camp; promising faithfully
to send all the visitors they could to the grand review, and drove off
highly entertained with their visit.Schermerhorn decided to take
the afternoon boat for the city and return early Friday morning, and the
boys, left to themselves, began to think of dinner, as it was two
o'clock.A brisk discussion was kept up all dinner time you may be sure,
concerning the event to come off on the morrow."I should like to know, for my part, what we do in a review," said
Jimmy, balancing his fork artistically on the end of his finger, and
looking solemnly round the table."March about,
and form into ranks and columns, and all that first, then do charming
"parade rest," "'der humps!"and the rest of it; and finish off by
firing off our guns, and showing how we can't hit anything by any
possibility!""But I'm sure father won't let us have any powder," said Peter
disconsolately."You can't think how I burnt the end of my nose last
Fourth with powder!It was so sore I couldn't blow it for a week!"The boys all burst out laughing at this dreadful disaster, and George
said, "You weren't lighting it with the end of your nose, were you?""No; but I was stooping over, charging one of my cannon, and I dropped
the 'punk' right in the muzzle somehow, and, would you believe it, the
nasty thing went off and burnt my nose!and father said I shouldn't play
with powder any more, because I might have put out my eyes.""Well, we must take it out in marching, then," said Freddy, with a
tremendous sigh."No, hold on; I'll tell you what we can do!""I have
some 'double headers' left from the Fourth; we might fire them out of
the cannon; they make noise enough, I'm sure.I'll write to my mother
this afternoon and get them."The boys couldn't help being struck with the generosity of this offer,
coming from Tom after their late rather unkind treatment of him; and the
older ones especially were very particular to thank him for his present.As soon as dinner was over, he started for the house to ask Mr.As he hurried along the road, his
bright black eyes sparkling with the happiness of doing a good action,
he heard trotting steps behind him, felt an arm stealing round his neck,
schoolboy fashion, and there was Freddy."I ran after you all the way," he pantingly said."I want to tell you,
dear Tom, how much we are obliged to you for giving us your crackers,
and how sorry we are that we acted so rudely to you the other day.Please forgive us; we all like you so much, and we would feel as mean as
anything to take your present without begging pardon.George, Peter, and
I feel truly ashamed of ourselves every time we think of that abominable
court martial.""There, old fellow, don't say a word more about it!"was the hearty
response; and Tom threw his arm affectionately about his companion."It
was my fault, Freddy, and all because I was mad at poor old Jerry; how
silly!I was sorry for what I said right afterward.""Yes; I'll like you as long as I live!And so
we will leave the two on their walk to the house, and close this
abominably long chapter.THERE are really scarcely words enough in the dictionary properly to
describe the immense amount of drill got through with by the Dashahed
Zouaves between three o'clock that afternoon and twelve, noon, of the
following day.This Friday afternoon was going to be memorable in
history for one of the most splendid reviews on record.They almost ran
poor old Jerry off his legs in their eagerness to go over every possible
variety of exercise known to "Hardee's Tactics," and nearly dislocated
their shoulder blades trying to waggle their elbows backward and forward
all at once when they went at "double quick;" at the same time keeping
the other arm immovably pinioned to their sides.Then that wonderful
operation of stacking the rebellious guns, which obstinately clattered
down nine times and a half out of ten, had to be gone through with, and
a special understanding promulgated in the corps as to when Jerry's
"'der arms!"meant "shoulder arms," and when "order arms" (or bringing
all the muskets down together with a bang); and, in short, there never
was such a busy time seen in camp before.Friday morning dawned, if possible, still more splendidly than any of
the preceding days, with a cool, refreshing breeze, just enough snowy
clouds in the sky to keep off the fiery summer heat in a measure, and
not a headache nor a heartache among the Zouaves to mar the pleasure of
the day.The review was to come off at four o'clock, when the July sun
would be somewhat diminished in warmth, and from some hints that Jerry
let fall, Mrs.Lockitt, and the fat cook, Mrs.Mincemeat, were holding
high council up at the house, over a certain collation to be partaken of
at the end of the entertainments.As the day wore on the excitement of our friends the Zouaves increased.They could hardly either eat their dinners, or sit down for more than a
moment at a time; and when, about three o'clock, Mr.Schermerhorn
entered the busy little camp, he was surrounded directly with a crowd of
eager questioners, all talking at once, and making as much noise as a
colony of rooks."Patience, patience, my good friends!"Schermerhorn, holding
up a finger for silence.Tom, here are your 'double
headers,' with love from your mother.Fred, I saw your father to-day,
and they are all coming down to the review.George, here is a note left
for you in my box at the Post Office, and Dashahed Zouaves in
general--I have one piece of advice to give you.Get dressed quietly,
and then sit down and rest yourselves.You will be tired out by the end
of the afternoon, at all events; so don't frisk about more than you can
help at present;" and Mr.Schermerhorn left the camp; while the boys,
under strong pressure of Jerry, and the distant notes of a band which
suddenly began to make itself heard, dressed themselves as nicely as
they could, and sat down with heroic determination to wait for four
o'clock.Presently, carriages began to crunch over the gravel road one after
another, filled with merry children, and not a few grown people besides.Jourdain, with Bella, were among the first to arrive; and
soon after the Carltons' barouche drove up.Jessie, for some unknown
reason, was full of half nervous glee, and broke into innumerable little
trilling laughs when any one spoke to her.A sheet of lilac note paper,
folded up tight, which she held in her hand, seemed to have something to
do with it, and her soft brown curls and spreading muslin skirts were in
equal danger of irremediable "mussing," as she fidgetted about on the
carriage seat, fully as restless as any of the Zouaves.Schermerhorn received his guests on the piazza, where all the chairs
in the house, one would think, were placed for the company, as the best
view of the lawn was from this point.To the extreme right were the
white tents of the camp, half hidden by the immense trunk of a
magnificent elm, the only tree that broke the smooth expanse of the
lawn.On the left a thick hawthorne hedge separated the ornamental
grounds from the cultivated fields of the place, while in front the view
was bounded by the blue and sparkling waters of the Sound.Soon four o'clock struck; and, punctual to the moment, the Zouaves could
be seen in the distance, forming their ranks.Jerry, in his newest suit
of regimentals, bustled about here and there, and presently his voice
was heard shouting, "Are ye all ready now?and to
the melodious notes of "Dixie," performed by the band, which was
stationed nearer the house, the regiment started up the lawn!Jerry
marching up beside them, and occasionally uttering such mysterious
mandates as, "Easy in the centre!Oh, what a burst of delighted applause greeted them as they neared the
house!The boys hurrahed, the girls clapped their hands, ladies and
gentlemen waved their hats and handkerchiefs; while the Dashahed
Zouaves, too soldierly _now_ to grin, drew up in a long line, and stood
like statues, without so much as winking.And now the music died away, and everybody was as still as a mouse,
while Jerry advanced to the front, and issued the preliminary order:

"To the rear--open order!"and the rear rank straightway fell back;
executing, in fact, that wonderful "tekkinapesstoth'rare" which had
puzzled them so much on the first day of their drilling.Then came those
other wonderful orders:

          "P'_sent_ humps!And so on, at which the muskets flew backward and forward, up and down,
with such wonderful precision.The spectators were delighted beyond
measure; an enthusiastic young gentleman, with about three hairs on
each side of his mustache, who belonged to the Twenty-second Regiment,
declared "It was the best drill he had seen out of his company room!"a
celebrated artist, whose name I dare not tell for the world, sharpened
his pencil, and broke the point off three times in his hurry, and at
last produced the beautiful sketch which appears at the front of this
volume; while all the little boys who were looking on, felt as if they
would give every one of their new boots and glass agates to belong to
the gallant Dashahed Zouaves.[Illustration: "DOUBLE-QUICK."]After the guns had been put in every possible variety of position, the
regiment went through their marching.They broke into companies,
formed the line again, divided in two equal parts, called "breaking into
platoons," showed how to "wheel on the right flank," and all manner of
other mysteries.Finally, they returned to their companies, and on Jerry's giving the
order, they started at "double quick" (which is the most comical
tritty-trot movement you can think of), dashed down the <DW72> of the
lawn, round the great elm, up hill again full speed, and in a moment
more were drawn up in unbroken lines before the house, and standing once
again like so many statues.Round after round of applause greeted the
Zouaves, who kept their positions for a moment, then snatching off
their saucy little fez caps, they gave the company three cheers in
return, of the most tremendous description; which quite took away the
little remaining breath they had after the "double quick."Thus ended the first part of the review; and now, with the assistance of
their rather Lilliputian battery, and Tom's double headers, they went
through some firing quite loud enough to make the little girls start and
jump uncomfortably; so this part of the entertainment was brought to
rather a sudden conclusion.Jerry had just issued the order, "Close up
in ranks to dismiss," when Mr.Schermerhorn, who, with Miss Carlton and
Jessie, had left the piazza a few minutes before, came forward, saying,
"Have the goodness to wait a moment, Colonel; there is one more ceremony
to go through with."The boys looked at each other in silent curiosity, wondering what could
be coming; when, all at once, the chairs on the piazza huddled back in a
great hurry, to make a lane for a beautiful little figure, which came
tripping from the open door.It was Jessie; but a great change had been made in her appearance.Over
her snowy muslin skirts she had a short classic tunic of red, white, and
blue silk; a wreath of red and white roses and bright blue jonquils
encircled her curls, and in her hand she carried a superb banner.It
was made of dark blue silk, trimmed with gold fringe; on one side was
painted an American eagle, and on the other the words "Dashahed
Zouaves," surrounded with a blaze of glory and gold stars.She advanced
to the edge of the piazza, and in a clear, sweet voice, a little
tremulous, but very distinct, she said:

          "COLONEL AND BRAVE SOLDIERS:

          "I congratulate you, in the name of our friends,
          on the success you have achieved.You have shown
          us to-day what Young America can do; and as a
          testimonial of our high admiration, I present you
          the colors of your regiment!"Take them, as the assurance that our hearts are
          with you; bear them as the symbol of the Cause you
          have enlisted under; and should you fall beneath
          them on the field of battle, I bid you lay down
          your lives cheerfully for the flag of your
          country, and breathe with your last sigh the name
          of the Union!Freddy's cheeks grew crimson, and the great tears swelled to his eyes as
he advanced to take the flag which Jessie held toward him.And now our
little Colonel came out bright, sure enough.Perhaps not another member
of the regiment, called upon to make a speech in this way, could have
thought of a word to reply; but Freddy's quick wit supplied him with
the right ideas; and it was with a proud, happy face, and clear voice
that he responded:

          "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:

          "I thank you, in the name of my regiment, for the
          honor you have done us.Inspired by your praises,
          proud to belong to the army of the Republic, we
          hope to go on as we have begun.To your kindness
          we owe the distinguishing colors under which we
          march hereafter; and by the Union for which we
          fight, they shall never float over a retreating
          battalion!"the cheers and clapping of hands which followed this little speech!Everybody was looking at Freddy as he stood there, the colors in his
hand, and the bright flush on his cheek, with the greatest admiration.Of course, his parents weren't proud of him; certainly not!But the wonders were not at an end yet; for suddenly the band began
playing a new air, and to this accompaniment, the sweet voice of some
lady unseen, but which sounded to those who knew, wonderfully like Miss
Lucy Carlton's, sang the following patriotic ballad:

          "We will stand by our Flag--let it lead where it will--
          Our hearts and our hopes fondly cling to it still;
          Through battle and danger our Cause must be won--
          Yet forward!still unsullied and bright,
          As when first its fair stars lit oppression's dark night
          And the standard that guides us forever shall be
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"A handful of living--an army of dead,
          The last charge been made and the last prayer been said;
          What is it--as sad we retreat from the plain
          That cheers us, and nerves us to rally again?to our country God-given,
          That gleams through our ranks like a glory from heaven!And the foe, as they fly, in our vanguard shall see
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"We will fight for the Flag, by the love that we bear
          In the Union and Freedom, we'll baffle despair;
          Trust on in our country, strike home for the right,
          And Treason shall vanish like mists of the night.every star in it glows,
          The terror of traitors!And the victory that crowns us shall glorified be,
          'Neath the Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"As the song ended, there was another tumult of applause; and then the
band struck up a lively quickstep, and the company, with the Zouaves
marching ahead, poured out on the lawn toward the camp, where a
bountiful collation was awaiting them, spread on the regimental table.Two splendid pyramids of flowers ornamented the centre, and all manner
of "goodies," as the children call them, occupied every inch of space on
the sides.At the head of the table Jerry had contrived a canopy from a
large flag, and underneath this, Miss Jessie, Colonel Freddy, with the
other officers, and some favored young ladies of their own age, took
their seats.The other children found places around the table, and a
merrier fete champetre never was seen.The band continued to play lively
airs from time to time, and I really can give you my word as an author,
that nobody looked cross for a single minute!Between you and me, little reader, there had been a secret arrangement
among the grown folks interested in the regiment, to get all this up in
such fine style.Every one had contributed something to give the Zouaves
their flag and music, while to Mr.Schermerhorn it fell to supply the
supper; and arrangements had been made and invitations issued since the
beginning of the week.The regiment, certainly, had the credit, however,
of getting up the review, it only having been the idea of their good
friends to have the entertainment and flag presentation.So there was a
pleasant surprise on both sides; and each party in the transaction, was
quite as much astonished and delighted as the other could wish.The long sunset shadows were rapidly stealing over the velvet sward as
the company rose from table, adding a new charm to the beauty of the
scene.Everywhere the grass was dotted with groups of elegant ladies and
gentlemen, and merry children, in light summer dresses and quaintly
pretty uniforms.The little camp, with the stacks of guns down its
centre, the bayonets flashing in the last rays of the sun, was all
crowded and brilliant with happy people; looking into the tents and
admiring their exquisite order, inspecting the bright muskets, and
listening eagerly or good-humoredly, as they happened to be children or
grown people, to the explanations and comments of the Zouaves.And on the little grassy knoll, where the flag staff was planted,
central figure of the scene, stood Colonel Freddy, silent and thoughtful
for the first time to-day, with Jerry beside him.The old man had
scarcely left his side since the boy took the flag; he would permit no
one else to wait upon him at table, and his eyes followed him as he
moved among the gay crowd, with a glance of the utmost pride and
affection.The old volunteer seemed to feel that the heart of a soldier
beat beneath the little dandy ruffled shirt and gold-laced jacket of the
young Colonel.Suddenly, the boy snatches up again the regimental
colors; the Stars and Stripes, and little Jessie's flag, and shakes
them out to the evening breeze; and as they flash into view and once
more the cheers of the Zouaves greet their colors, he says, with
quivering lip and flashing eye, "Jerry, if God spares me to be a man,
I'll live and die a soldier!"The soft evening light was deepening into night, and the beautiful
planet Venus rising in the west, when the visitors bade adieu to the
camp; the Zouaves were shaken hands with until their wrists fairly
ached; and then they all shook hands with "dear" Jessie, as Charley was
heard to call her before the end of the day, and heard her say in her
soft little voice how sorry she was they must go to-morrow (though she
certainly couldn't have been sorrier than _they_ were), and then the
good people all got into their carriages again, and drove off; waving
their handkerchiefs for good-by as long as the camp could be seen; and
so, with the sound of the last wheels dying away in the distance, ended
the very end of

                                THE GRAND REVIEW.AND now, at last, had come that "day of disaster," when Camp McClellan
must be deserted.The very sun didn't shine so brilliantly as usual,
thought the Zouaves; and it was positively certain that the past five
days, although they had occurred in the middle of summer, were the very
shortest ever known!Eleven o'clock was the hour appointed for the
breaking up of the camp, in order that they might return to the city by
the early afternoon boat."Is it possible we have been here a week?"exclaimed Jimmy, as he sat
down to breakfast."It seems as if we had only come yesterday.""What a jolly time it has been!""I don't want
to go to Newport a bit."To Baltimore--but I don't mean to Secesh!"added Tom, with a little
blush."I have a cousin in the Palmetto Guards at Charleston, and that's
one too many rebels in the family."cried George Chadwick; "the Pringles are a first rate
family; the rest of you are loyal enough, I'm sure!"and George gave
Tom such a slap on the back, in token of his good will, that it quite
brought the tears into his eyes.When breakfast was over, the Zouaves repaired to their tents, and
proceeded to pack their clothes away out of the lockers.They were not
very scientific packers, and, in fact, the usual mode of doing the
business was to ram everything higgledy-piggledy into their valises, and
then jump on them until they consented to come together and be locked.Presently Jerry came trotting down with a donkey cart used on the farm,
and under his directions the boys folded their blankets neatly up, and
placed them in the vehicle, which then drove off with its load, leaving
them to get out and pile together the other furnishings of the tents;
for, of course, as soldiers, they were expected to wind up their own
affairs, and we all know that boys will do considerable _hard work_ when
it comes in the form of _play_.Just as the cart, with its vicious
little wrong-headed steed, had tugged, and jerked, and worried itself
out of sight, a light basket carriage, drawn by two dashing black
Canadian ponies, drew up opposite the camp, and the reins were let fall
by a young lady in a saucy "pork pie" straw hat, who was driving--no
other than Miss Carlton, with Jessie beside her.The boys eagerly
surrounded the little carriage, and Miss Carlton said, laughing, "Jessie
begged so hard for a last look at the camp, that I had to bring her."Really," repeated Freddy; "but I am so glad you came, Miss Jessie, just
in time to see us off.""You know soldiers take themselves away houses and all," said George;
"you will see the tents come down with a run presently."As he spoke, the donkey
cart rattled up, and Jerry, touching his cap to the ladies, got out, and
prepared to superintend the downfall of the tents.By his directions,
two of the Zouaves went to each tent, and pulled the stakes first from
one corner, then the other; then they grasped firmly the pole which
supported the centre, and when the sergeant ejaculated "Now!"the tents slid smoothly to the ground all at the same moment,
just as you may have made a row of blocks fall down by upsetting the
first one.And now came the last ceremony, the hauling down of the flag.shouted Jerry, and instantly a company was
detached, who brought the six little cannon under the flagstaff, and
charged them with the last of the double headers, saved for this
purpose; Freddy stood close to the flagstaff, with the halyards ready in
his hands.and the folds of the flag stream out proudly in the breeze, as it
rapidly descends the halyards, and flutters softly to the greensward.There was perfectly dead silence for a moment; then the voice of Mr.Schermerhorn was heard calling, "Come, boys, are you ready?Jump in,
then, it is time to start for the boat."The boys turned and saw the
carriages which had brought them so merrily to the camp waiting to
convey them once more to the wharf; while a man belonging to the farm
was rapidly piling the regimental luggage into a wagon.With sorrowful faces the Zouaves clustered around the pretty pony
chaise; shaking hands once more with Jessie, and internally vowing to
adore her as long as they lived.Then they got into the carriages, and
old Jerry grasped Freddy's hand with an affectionate "Good-by, my little
Colonel, God bless ye!Old Jerry won't never forget your noble face as
long as he lives."It would have seemed like insulting the old man to
offer him money in return for his loving admiration, but the handsome
gilt-edged Bible that found its way to him soon after the departure of
the regiment, was inscribed with the irregular schoolboy signature of
"Freddy Jourdain, with love to his old friend Jeremiah Pike."As for the regimental standards, they were found to be rather beyond
the capacity of a rockaway crammed full of Zouaves, so Tom insisted on
riding on top of the baggage, that he might have the pleasure of
carrying them all the way.Up he mounted, as brisk as a lamplighter,
with that monkey, Peter, after him, the flags were handed up, and with
three ringing cheers, the vehicles started at a rapid trot, and the
regiment was fairly off.They almost broke their necks leaning back to
see the last of "dear Jessie," until the locusts hid them from sight,
when they relapsed into somewhat dismal silence for full five minutes.As Peter was going on to Niagara with his father, Mr.Schermerhorn
accompanied the regiment to the city, which looked dustier and red
brickier (what a word!)than ever, now that they were fresh from the
lovely green of the country.Schermerhorn's advice, the party
took possession of two empty Fifth avenue stages which happened to be
waiting at the Fulton ferry, and rode slowly up Broadway to Chambers
street, where Peter and his father bid them good-by, and went off to the
depot.As Peter had declined changing his clothes before he left, they
had to travel all the way to Buffalo with our young friend in this
unusual guise; but, as people had become used to seeing soldiers
parading about in uniform, they didn't seem particularly surprised,
whereat Master Peter was rather disappointed.To go back to the Zouaves, however.When the stages turned into Fifth
avenue, they decided to get out; and after forming their ranks in fine
style, they marched up the avenue, on the sidewalk this time, stopping
at the various houses or street corners where they must bid adieu to one
and another of their number, promising to see each other again as soon
as possible.At last only Tom and Freddy were left to go home by themselves.As they
marched along, keeping faultless step, Freddy exclaimed, "I tell you
what, Tom!I mean to ask my father, the minute he comes home, to let me
go to West Point as soon as I leave school!I must be a soldier--I
can't think of anything else!""That's just what I mean to do!"cried Tom, with sparkling eyes; "and,
Fred, if you get promoted before me, promise you will have me in your
regiment, won't you?"answered Freddy; "but you're the oldest, Tom,
and, you know, the oldest gets promoted first; so mind you don't forget
me when you come to your command!"As he spoke, they reached his own home; and our hero, glad after all to
come back to father, mother, and sister, bounded up the steps, and rang
the bell good and _hard_, just to let Joseph know that a personage of
eminence had arrived.As the door opened, he turned gayly round, cap in
hand, saying, "Good-by, Maryland; you've left the regiment, but you'll
never leave the Union!"and the last words he heard Tom say were, "No,
by George, _never_!"*       *       *       *       *

And now, dear little readers, my boy friends in particular, the history
of Freddy Jourdain must close.He still lives in New York, and attends
Dr.Larned's school, where he is at the head of all his classes.The Dashahed Zouaves have met very often since the encampment, and had
many a good drill in their room--the large attic floor which Mr.Jourdain allowed them for their special accommodation, and where the
beautiful regimental colors are carefully kept, to be proudly displayed
in every parade of the Zouaves.When he is sixteen, the boy Colonel is to enter West Point Academy, and
learn to be a real soldier; while Tom--poor Tom, who went down to
Baltimore that pleasant July month, promising so faithfully to join
Freddy in the cadet corps, may never see the North again.And in conclusion let me say, that should our country again be in danger
in after years, which God forbid, we may be sure that first in the
field, and foremost in the van of the grand army, will be our gallant
young friend,

                                 COLONEL FREDDY.IT took a great many Saturday afternoons to finish the story of "Colonel
Freddy," and the children returned to it at each reading with renewed
and breathless interest.George and Helen couldn't help jumping up off
their seats once or twice and clapping their hands with delight when
anything specially exciting took place in the pages of the wonderful
story that was seen "before it was printed," and a great many "oh's" and
"ah's" testified to their appreciation of the gallant "Dashahed
Zouaves."They laughed over the captive Tom, and cried over the true
story of the old sergeant; and when at length the very last word had
been read, and their mother had laid down the manuscript, George sprang
up once more, exclaiming; "Oh, I wish I could be a boy soldier!Mamma,
mayn't I recruit a regiment and camp out too?"cried his sister; "I wish I had been Jessie; what a
pity it wasn't all true!""And what if I should tell you," said their mother, laughing, "that a
little bird has whispered in my ear that 'Colonel Freddy' was
wonderfully like your little Long Island friend Hilton R----?""Oh, something funny I heard about him last summer; never mind what!"The children wisely concluded that it was no use to ask any more
questions; at the same moment solemnly resolving that the very next time
they paid a visit to their aunt, who lived at Astoria, they would beg
her to let them drive over to Mr.R----'s place, and find out all about
it.After this, there were no more readings for several Saturdays; but at
last one morning when the children had almost given up all hopes of more
stories, George opened his eyes on the sock hanging against the door,
which looked more bulgy than ever.he shouted; "Aunt Fanny's
daughter hasn't forgotten us, after all!"and dressing himself in a
double quick, helter-skelter fashion, George dashed out into the entry,
forgot his good resolution, and slid down the banisters like a streak of
lightning and began pummelling on his sister's door with both fists;
shouting, "Come, get up!here's another Sock story for
us!"This delightful announcement was quite sufficient to make Helen's
stockings, which she was just drawing on in a lazy fashion, fly up to
their places in a hurry; then she popped her button-over boots on the
wrong feet, and had to take them off and try again; and, in short, the
whole of her dressing was an excellent illustration of that time-honored
maxim, "The more _haste_, the worse _speed_;" George, meanwhile,
performing a distracted Indian war dance in the entry outside, until his
father opened his door and wanted to know what the racket was all about.At this moment Helen came out, and the two children scampered down
stairs, and sitting down side by side on the sofa, they proceeded to
examine this second instalment of the Sock stories.They found it was
again a whole book; and the title, on a little page by itself, read
"GERMAN SOCKS.""These must be more stories like that
dear 'Little White Angel.'"And so they proved to be; for, on their mother's commencing to read the
first story, it was found to be called, "God's Pensioners;" and
commenced, "It was a cold--" but stop!This book was to be devoted
to "Colonel Freddy;" but if you will only go to Mr.Leavitt's, the
publishers, you will there discover what was the rest of the second Sock
Stories.*       *       *       *       *

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Red, White, Blue Socks.The Round Dance demands that a certain fixed grouping of the partners be
maintained in order that the rotation around a common moving centre may
be accomplished, and it is here that the most serious problem is to be
found.The dancing profession long ago undertook to settle upon arbitrary
groupings satisfactory to the needs of the dancers, and conforming to
all the requirements of propriety and hygienic exercise.[Illustration]

Acting upon this basis, the reputable teachers of dancing throughout the
world have adopted and promulgated three fundamental groupings for the
Round Dance which are so constructed as to provide the greatest ease of
execution and freedom of action.They are known as the Waltz Position,
the Open Position, and the Side Position of the Waltz.All round dances
are executed in one or another of these groupings, which are not only
accepted by all good teachers, but, with the exception of certain minor
and unimportant variations, rigidly adhered to in all their work.In the Waltz Position the partners stand facing one another, with
shoulders parallel, and looking over one another's right shoulder.Special attention must be paid to the parallel position of the
shoulders, in order to fit the individual movements of the partners
along the line of direction.The gentleman places his right hand lightly upon the lady's back, at a
point about half-way across, between the waist-line and the
shoulder-blades.The fingers are so rounded as to permit the free
circulation of air between the palm of the hand and the lady's back, and
should not be spread.The lady places her left hand lightly upon the gentleman's arm, allowing
her fore-arm to rest gently upon his arm.The partners stand at an easy
distance from one another, inclining toward the common centre very
slightly.The free hands are lightly joined at the side.This is merely
to provide occupation for the disengaged arms, and the gentleman holds
the tip of the lady's hand lightly in the bended fingers of his own.Guiding is accomplished by the gentleman through a slight lifting of his
right elbow.[Illustration]


THE OPEN POSITION

The Open Position needs no explanation, and can be readily understood
from the illustration facing page 8.THE SIDE POSITION OF THE WALTZ

The side position of the Waltz differs from the Waltz Position only in
the fact that the partners stand side by side and with the engaged arms
more widely extended.The free arms are held as in the frontispiece.In
the actual rotation this position naturally resolves itself into the
regular Waltz Position.THE STEP OF THE BOSTON

The preparatory step of the Boston differs materially from that of any
other Social Dance.There is _only one position_ of the feet in the
Boston--the 4th.That is to say, the feet are separated one from the
other as in walking.On the first count of the measure the whole leg swings freely, and as a
unit, from the hip, and the foot is put down practically flat upon the
floor, where it immediately receives the entire weight of the body
_perpendicularly_.The weight is held entirely upon this foot during the
remainder of the measure, whether it be in 3/4 or 2/4 time.The following preparatory exercises must be practiced forward and
backward until the movements become natural, before proceeding.In going backward, the foot must be carried to the rear as far as
possible, and the weight must always be perpendicular to the supporting
foot.These movements are identical with walking, and except the particular
care which must be bestowed upon the placing of the foot on the first
count of the measure, they require no special degree of attention.On the second count the free leg swings forward until the knee has
become entirely straightened, and is held, suspended, during the third
count of the measure.This should be practiced, first with the weight
resting upon the entire sole of the supporting foot, and then, when this
has been perfectly accomplished, the same exercise may be supplemented
by raising the heel (of the supporting foot) on the second count and
lowering it on the third count._Great care must be taken not to divide
the weight._

For the purpose of instruction, it is well to practice these steps to
Mazurka music, because of the clearness of the count.[Illustration]

When the foregoing exercises have been so fully mastered as to become,
in a sense, muscular habits, we may, with safety, add the next feature.This consists in touching the floor with the point of the free foot, at
a point as far forward or backward as can be done without dividing the
weight, on the second count of the measure.Thus, we have accomplished,
as it were, an interrupted, or, at least, an arrested step, and this is
the true essence of the Boston.Too great care cannot be expended upon this phase of the step, and it
must be practiced over and over again, both forward and backward, until
the movement has become second nature.All this must precede any attempt
to turn.The turning of the Boston is simplicity itself, but it is, nevertheless,
the one point in the instruction which is most bothersome to
learners.The turn is executed upon the ball of _the supporting foot_,
and consists in twisting half round without lifting either foot from the
ground.In this, the weight is held altogether upon the supporting foot,
and there is no crossing.In carrying the foot forward for the second movement, the knees must
pass close to one another, and care must be taken that _the entire half
turn comes upon the last count of the measure_.To sum up:--

Starting with the weight upon the left foot, step forward, placing the
entire weight upon the right foot, as in the illustration facing page 14
(count 1); swing left leg quickly forward, straightening the left knee
and raising the right heel, and touch the floor with the extended left
foot as in the illustration facing page 16, but without placing any
weight upon that foot (count 2); execute a half-turn to the left,
backward, upon the ball of the supporting (right) foot, at the same time
lowering the right heel, and finish as in the illustration opposite page
18 (count 3).[Illustration]

Starting again, this time with the weight wholly upon the right foot,
and with the left leg extended backward, and the point of the left foot
lightly touching the floor, step backward, throwing the weight entirely
upon the left foot which sinks to a position flat upon the floor, as
shown in the illustration facing page 21, (count 4); carry the right
foot quickly backward, and touch with the point as far back as possible
upon the line of direction without dividing the weight, at the same time
raising the left heel as in the illustration facing page 22, (count 5);
and complete the rotation by executing a half-turn to the right,
forward, upon the ball of the left foot, simultaneously lowering the
left heel, and finishing as in the illustration facing page 24, (count
6).THE REVERSE

The reverse of the step should be acquired at the same time as the
rotation to the right, and it is, therefore, of great importance to
alternate from the right to the left rotation from the beginning of the
turning exercise.The reverse itself, that is to say, the act of
alternating is effected in a single measure without turning (see
preparatory exercise, page 13) which may be taken backward by the
gentleman and forward by the lady, whenever they have completed a whole
turn.The mechanism of the reverse turn is exactly the same as that of the
turn to the right, except that it is accomplished with the other foot,
and in the opposite direction.There is no better or more efficacious exercise to perfect the Boston,
than that which is made up of one complete turn to the right, a measure
to reverse, and a complete turn to the left.This should be practised
until one has entirely mastered the motion and rhythm of the dance.The
writer has used this exercise in all his work, and finds it not only
helpful and interesting to the pupil, but of special advantage in
obviating the possibility of dizziness, and the consequent
unpleasantness and loss of time.[Illustration]

After acquiring a degree of ease in the execution of these movements to
Mazurka music, it is advisable to vary the rhythm by the introduction of
Spanish or other clearly accented Waltz music, before using the more
liquid compositions of Strauss or such modern song waltzes as those of
Danglas, Sinibaldi, etc.It is one of the remarkable features of the Boston that the weight is
always opposite the line of direction--that is to say, in going forward,
the weight is retained upon the rear foot, and in going backward, the
weight is always upon the front foot (direction always radiates from the
dancer).Thus, in proceeding around the room, the weight must always be
held back, instead of inclining slightly forward as in the other round
dances.This seeming contradiction of forces lends to the Boston a
unique charm which is to be found in no other dance.As the dancer becomes more familiar with the Boston, the movement
becomes so natural that little or no thought need be paid to technique,
in order to develop the peculiar grace of it.The fact of its being a dance altogether in one position calls for
greater skill in the execution of the Boston, than would be the case if
there were other changes and contrasts possible, just as it is more
difficult to play a melody upon a violin of only one string.The Boston, in its completed form, resolves itself into a sort of
walking movement, so natural and easy that it may be enjoyed for a
whole evening without more fatigue than would be the result of a single
hour of the Waltz and Two-Step.Aside from the attractiveness of the Boston as a social dance, its
physical benefits are more positive than those of any other Round Dance
that we have ever had.The action is so adjusted as to provide the
maximum of muscular exercise and the minimum of physical effort.This
tends towards the conservation of energy, and produces and maintains, at
the same time an evenness of blood pressure and circulation.The
movements also necessitate a constant exercise of the ankles and insteps
which is very strengthening to those parts, and cannot fail to raise and
support the arch of the foot.Taken from any standpoint, the Boston is one of the most worthy forms of
the social dance ever devised, and the distortions of position which
are now occasionally practiced must soon give way to the genuinely
refining influence of the action.[Illustration]

Of the various forms of the Boston, there is little to be said beyond
the description of the manner of their execution, which will be treated
in the following pages.It is hoped that this book will help toward a more complete
understanding of the beauties and attractions of the Boston, and further
the proper appreciation of it._All descriptions of dances given in this book relate to the lady's
part.The gentleman's is exactly the same, but in the countermotion._


THE LONG BOSTON

The ordinary form of the Boston as described in the foregoing pages is
commonly known as the "Long" Boston to distinguish it from other forms
and variations.It is danced in 3/4 time, either Waltz or Mazurka, and
at any tempo desired.As this is the fundamental form of the Boston, it
should be thoroughly acquired before undertaking any other.[Illustration]


THE SHORT BOSTON

The "Short" Boston differs from the "Long" Boston only in measure.It is
danced in either 2/4 or 6/8 time, and the first movement (in 2/4 time)
occupies the duration of a quarter-note.The second and third movements
each occupy the duration of an eighth-note.Thus, there exists between
the "Long" and the "Short" Boston the same difference as between the
Waltz and the Galop.In the more rapid forms of the "Short" Boston, the
rising and sinking upon the second and third movements naturally take
the form of a hop or skip.The dance is more enjoyable and less
fatiguing in moderate tempo.THE OPEN BOSTON

The "Open" Boston contains two parts of eight measures each.The first
part is danced in the positions shown in the illustrations facing pages
8 and 10, and the second part consists of 8 measures of the "Long"
Boston.In the first part, the dancers execute three Boston steps forward,
without turning, and one Boston step turning (towards the partner) to
face directly backward (1/2 turn).This is followed by three Boston steps backward (without turning) in the
position shown in the illustration facing page 10, followed by one
Boston step turning (toward the partner) and finishing in regular Waltz
Position for the execution of the second part.[Illustration]


THE BOSTON DIP

The "Dip" is a combination dance in 3/4 or 3/8 time, and contains 4
measures of the "Long" Boston, preceded by 4 measures, as follows:

Standing upon the left foot, step directly to the side, and transfer the
weight to the right foot (count 1); swing the left leg to the right in
front of the right, at the same time raising the right heel (count 2);
lower the right heel (count 3); return the left foot to its original
place where it receives the weight (count 4); swing the right leg across
in front of the left, raising the left heel (count 5); and lower the
left heel (count 6).Swing the right foot to the right, and put it down directly at the side
of the left (count 1); hop on the right foot and swing the left across
in front (count 2); fall back upon the right foot (count 3); put down
the left foot, crossing in front of the right, and transfer weight to it
(count 4); with right foot step a whole step to the right (count 5); and
finish by bringing the left foot against the right, where it receives
the weight (count 6).In executing the hop upon counts 2 and 3 of the third measure, the
movement must be so far delayed that the falling back will exactly
coincide with the third count of the music.[Illustration]




THE TURKEY TROT

_Preparation:--Side Position of the Waltz._


During the first four measures take four Boston steps without turning
(lady forward, gentleman backward), and bending the supporting knee,
stretch the free foot backward, (lady's left, gentleman's right) as
shown in the illustration opposite.Execute four drawing steps to the side (lady's right, gentleman's left)
swaying the shoulders and body in the direction of the drawn foot, and
pointing with the free foot upon the fourth, as shown in figure.Eight whole turns, Short Boston or Two-Step.*       *       *       *       *

  A splendid specimen for this dance will be found in "The Gobbler" by
  J. Monroe.THE AEROPLANE GLIDE


The "Aeroplane Glide" is very similar to the Boston Dip.It is supposed
to represent the start of the flight of an aeroplane, and derives its
name from that fact.The sole difference between the "Dip" and "Aeroplane" consists in the
six running steps which make up the first two measures.Of these running
steps, which are executed sidewise and with alternate crossings, before
and behind, only the fourth, at the beginning of the second measure
requires special description.Upon this step, the supporting knee is
noticeably bended to coincide with the accent of the music.The rest of the dance is identical with the "Dip".[Illustration]




THE TANGO


The Tango is a Spanish American dance which contains much of the
peculiar charm of the other Spanish dances, and its execution depends
largely upon the ability of the dancers so to grasp the rhythm of the
music as to interpret it by their movements.The steps are all simple,
and the dancers are permitted to vary or improvise the figures at will.Of these figures the two which follow are most common, and lend
themselves most readily to verbal description.1

The partners face one another as in Waltz Position.The gentleman takes
the lady's right hand in his left, and, stretching the arms to the full
extent, holding them at the shoulder height, he places her right hand
upon his left shoulder, and holds it there, as in the illustration
opposite page 30.In starting, the gentleman throws his right shoulder slightly back and
steps directly backward with his left foot, while the lady follows
forward with her right.In this manner both continue two steps, crossing
one foot over the other and then execute a half-turn in the same
direction.This is followed by four measures of the Two-Step and the
whole is repeated at will.[Illustration]


TANGO No.2

This variant starts from the same position as Tango No.The gentleman
takes two steps backward with the lady following forward, and then two
steps to the side (the lady's right and the gentleman's left) and two
steps in the opposite direction to the original position.These steps to the side should be marked by the swaying of the bodies as
the feet are drawn together on the second count of the measure, and the
whole is followed by 8 measures of the Two-Step.IDEAL MUSIC FOR THE "BOSTON"

  Text in italics is surrounded with underscores: _italics_.He had, I confess, served the tyrant Cromwell, when a young man, but it
was without malice, as a soldier of fortune; and he readily submitted,
and that with joy, bringing an entire fleet with him from the Sound, at
the first tidings of his Majesty's restoration.I verily believe him as
faithful a subject as any that were not his friends.I am yet heartily
grieved at this mighty loss, nor do I call it to my thoughts without
emotion.[Sidenote: ROCHESTER]

2d June, 1672.Trinity Sunday, I passed at Rochester; and, on the 5th,
there was buried in the Cathedral Monsieur Rabiniere, Rear Admiral of
the French squadron, a gallant person, who died of the wounds he
received in the fight.This ceremony lay on me, which I performed with
all the decency I could, inviting the Mayor and Aldermen to come in
their formalities.Sir Jonas Atkins was there with his guards; and the
Dean and Prebendaries: one of his countrymen pronouncing a funeral
oration at the brink of his grave, which I caused to be dug in the
choir.This is more at large described in the "Gazette" of that day;
Colonel Reymes, my colleague in commission, assisting, who was so kind
as to accompany me from London, though it was not his district; for
indeed the stress of both these wars lay more on me by far than on any
of my brethren, who had little to do in theirs.I went to see Upnore
Castle, which I found pretty well defended, but of no great moment.Next day I sailed to the fleet, now riding at the buoy of the "Nore,"
where I met his Majesty, the Duke, Lord Arlington, and all the great
men, in the "Charles," lying miserably shattered; but the miss of Lord
Sandwich redoubled the loss to me, and showed the folly of hazarding so
brave a fleet, and losing so many good men, for no provocation but that
the Hollanders exceeded us in industry, and in all things but envy.At Sheerness, I gave his Majesty and his Royal Highness an account of my
charge, and returned to Queenborough; next day dined at Major Dorel's,
Governor of Sheerness; thence, to Rochester; and the following day,
home.To London to his Majesty, to solicit for money for the
sick and wounded, which he promised me.Most of this week busied
with the sick and wounded.To Lord Sandwich's funeral, which was by water to
Westminster, in solemn pomp.I entertained the Maids of Honor (among whom there was
one I infinitely esteemed for her many and extraordinary virtues[31]) at
a comedy this afternoon, and so went home.Blagg whom Evelyn never tires of instancing and
    characterizing as a rare example of piety and virtue, in so rare a
    wit, beauty, and perfection, in a licentious court, and depraved
    age.Godolphin, and her life,
    written by Evelyn, has been edited and published by the Bishop of
    Oxford.]I was at the betrothal of Lord Arlington's only
daughter (a sweet child if ever there was any[32]) to the Duke of
Grafton, the King's natural son by the Duchess of Cleveland; the
Archbishop of Canterbury officiating, the King and the grandees being
present.I had a favor given me by my Lady; but took no great joy at the
thing for many reasons.[Footnote 32: She was then only fifteen years old.]Sir James Hayes, Secretary to Prince Rupert, dined
with me; after dinner I was sent to Gravesend to dispose of no fewer
than 800 sick men.That night I got to the fleet at the buoy of the
"Nore," where I spoke with the King and the Duke; and, after dinner next
day, returned to Gravesend.I spent this week in soliciting for moneys, and in
reading to my Lord Clifford my papers relating to the first Holland war.Now, our Council of Plantations met at Lord Shaftesbury's (Chancellor of
the Exchequer) to read and reform the draft of our new Patent, joining
the Council of Trade to our political capacities.After this, I returned
home, in order to another excursion to the seaside, to get as many as
possible of the men who were recovered on board the fleet.I lay at Gravesend, thence to Rochester, returning
on the 11th.Duport, Greek Professor of Cambridge, preached
before the King, on 1 Timothy vi.No great preacher, but a very
worthy and learned man.I dined at Lord John Berkeley's, newly arrived
out of Ireland, where he had been Deputy; it was in his new house, or
rather palace; for I am assured it stood him in near L30,000.It was
very well built, and has many noble rooms, but they are not very
convenient, consisting but of one _Corps de Logis_; they are all rooms
of state, without closets.The staircase is of cedar, the furniture is
princely: the kitchen and stables are ill placed, and the corridor
worse, having no report to the wings they join to.For the rest, the
fore-court is noble, so are the stables; and, above all, the gardens,
which are incomparable by reason of the inequality of the ground, and a
pretty piscina.The holly hedges on the terrace I advised the planting
of.The porticos are in imitation of a house described by Palladio; but
it happens to be the worst in his book, though my good friend, Mr.Hugh
May, his Lordship's architect, effected it.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th September, 1672.I carried with me to dinner my Lord H. Howard (now
to be made Earl of Norwich and Earl Marshal of England) to Sir Robert
Clayton's, now Sheriff of London, at his new house, where we had a great
feast; it is built indeed for a great magistrate, at excessive cost.The
cedar dining room is painted with the history of the Giants' War,
incomparably done by Mr.Streeter, but the figures are too near the eye.Thistlethwaite preached at Whitehall on Rev.2,--a young, but good preacher.Blandford, Bishop of Worcester, and Dean of the Chapel, officiating.Dined at my Lord Clifford's, with Lord Mulgrave, Sir Gilbert Talbot, and
Sir Robert Holmes.I took leave of my Lady Sunderland, who was going to
Paris to my Lord, now ambassador there.She made me stay to dinner at
Leicester House, and afterward sent for Richardson, the famous
fire-eater.He devoured brimstone on glowing coals before us, chewing
and swallowing them; he melted a beer-glass and ate it quite up; then,
taking a live coal on his tongue, he put on it a raw oyster, the coal
was blown on with bellows till it flamed and sparkled in his mouth, and
so remained till the oyster gaped and was quite boiled.Then, he melted
pitch and wax with sulphur, which he drank down as it flamed; I saw it
flaming in his mouth a good while; he also took up a thick piece of
iron, such as laundresses use to put in their smoothing boxes, when it
was fiery hot, held it between his teeth, then in his hand, and threw it
about like a stone; but this, I observed, he cared not to hold very
long; then he stood on a small pot, and, bending his body, took a
glowing iron with his mouth from between his feet, without touching the
pot, or ground, with his hands; with divers other prodigious feats.After sermon (being summoned before), I went to my
Lord Keeper's, Sir Orlando Bridgeman, at Essex House, where our new
patent was opened and read, constituting us that were of the Council of
Plantations, to be now of the Council of Trade also, both united.After
the patent was read, we all took our oaths, and departed.Met in Council, the Earl of Shaftesbury, now our
president, swearing our secretary and his clerks, which was Mr.Locke,
an excellent learned gentleman, and student of Christ Church, Mr.We dispatched a letter to Sir Thomas Linch, Governor of
Jamaica, giving him notice of a design of the Dutch on that island.I went to hear that famous preacher, Dr.Giles's, on Psalm xxxix.This divine had been twice at
Jerusalem, and was not only a very pious and holy man, but excellent in
the pulpit for the moving affections.At Council, we debated the business of the consulate
of Leghorn.I was of the committee with Sir Humphry Winch, the chairman,
to examine the laws of his Majesty's several plantations and colonies in
the West Indies, etc.Many merchants were summoned about the consulate of
Venice; which caused great disputes; the most considerable thought it
useless.This being the Queen-Consort's birthday, there was an
extraordinary appearance of gallantry, and a ball danced at Court.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st January, 1672-73.After public prayers in the chapel at Whitehall,
when I gave God solemn thanks for all his mercies to me the year past,
and my humble supplications to him for his blessing the year now
entering, I returned home, having my poor deceased servant (Adams) to
bury, who died of pleurisy.My son now published his version of "_Raptinus
Hortorum_."Visited Don Francisco de Melos, the Portugal
Ambassador, who showed me his curious collection of books and pictures.He was a person of good parts, and a virtuous man.To Council about reforming an abuse of the dyers
with _saundus_, and other false drugs; examined divers of that trade.The Bishop of Chichester preached before the King
on Coloss.14, 15, admirably well, as he can do nothing but what is
well.Holden, preached in Whitehall
chapel, on Psalm iv.This gentleman is a very excellent and
universal scholar, a good and wise man; but he had not the popular way
of preaching, nor is in any measure fit for our plain and vulgar
auditory, as his predecessor was.There was, however, no comparison
between their parts for profound learning.But time and experience may
form him to a more practical way than that he is in of University
lectures and erudition; which is now universally left off for what is
much more profitable.I heard the speech made to the Lords in their House by
Sir Samuel Tuke, in behalf of the <DW7>s, to take off the penal laws;
and then dined with Colonel Norwood.Pearson, Bishop of Chester, preached on Hebrews
ix.14; a most incomparable sermon from one of the most learned divines
of our nation.I dined at my Lord Arlington's with the Duke and Duchess
of Monmouth; she is one of the wisest and craftiest of her sex, and has
much wit.Here was also the learned Isaac Vossius.During Lent there is constantly the most excellent preaching by the most
eminent bishops and divines of the nation.I was sworn a younger brother of the Trinity House,
with my most worthy and long-acquainted noble friend, Lord Ossory
(eldest son to the Duke of Ormond), Sir Richard Browne, my
father-in-law, being now Master of that Society; after which there was a
great collation.I carried my son to the Bishop of Chichester, that
learned and pious man, Dr.Peter Gunning, to be instructed by him before
he received the Holy Sacrament, when he gave him most excellent advice,
which I pray God may influence and remain with him as long as he lives;
and O that I had been so blessed and instructed, when first I was
admitted to that sacred ordinance!Myself and son received the blessed
Communion, it being his first time, and with that whole week's more
extraordinary preparation.I beseech God to make him a sincere and good
Christian, while I endeavor to instill into him the fear and love of
God, and discharge the duty of a father.At the sermon _coram Rege_, preached by Dr.Sparrow, Bishop of Exeter,
to a most crowded auditory; I stayed to see whether, according to
custom, the Duke of York received the Communion with the King; but he
did not, to the amazement of everybody.This being the second year he
had forborne, and put it off, and within a day of the Parliament
sitting, who had lately made so severe an Act against the increase of
Popery, gave exceeding grief and scandal to the whole nation, that the
heir of it, and the son of a martyr for the Protestant religion, should
apostatize.What the consequence of this will be, God only knows, and
wise men dread.I dined with the plenipotentiaries designed for the
treaty of Nimeguen.I carried Lady Tuke to thank the Countess of Arlington
for speaking to his Majesty in her behalf, for being one of the Queen
Consort's women.She carried us up into her new dressing room at Goring
House, where was a bed, two glasses, silver jars, and vases, cabinets,
and other so rich furniture as I had seldom seen; to this excess of
superfluity were we now arrived and that not only at Court, but almost
universally, even to wantonness and profusion.Compton, brother to the Earl of Northampton, preached on 1 Corinth.11-16, showing the Church's power in ordaining things indifferent;
this worthy person's talent is not preaching, but he is likely to make a
grave and serious good man.I saw her Majesty's rich toilet in her dressing room, being all of massy
gold, presented to her by the King, valued at L4,000.Martin's the Holy
Sacrament following, which I partook of, upon obligation of the late Act
of Parliament, enjoining everybody in office, civil or military, under
penalty of L500, to receive it within one month before two authentic
witnesses; being engrossed on parchment, to be afterward produced in the
Court of Chancery, or some other Court of Record; which I did at the
Chancery bar, as being one of the Council of Plantations and Trade;
taking then also the oath of allegiance and supremacy, signing the
clause in the said Act against Transubstantiation.My son was made a younger brother of the Trinity House.The new master was Sir J. Smith, one of the Commissioners of the Navy, a
stout seaman, who had interposed and saved the Duke from perishing by a
fire ship in the late war.I carried one Withers, an ingenious shipwright, to the
King to show him some new method of building.I saw the Italian comedy at the Court, this afternoon.Came to visit and dine with me my Lord Viscount
Cornbury and his Lady; Lady Frances Hyde, sister to the Duchess of York;
and Mrs.We went, after dinner, to see
the formal and formidable camp on Blackheath, raised to invade Holland;
or, as others suspected for another design.Thence, to the Italian
glass-house at Greenwich, where glass was blown of finer metal than that
of Murano, at Venice.Came to visit us, with other ladies of rank, Mrs.Sedley,[33] daughter to Sir Charles, who was none of the most virtuous,
but a wit.[Footnote 33: The Duke of York's mistress, afterward created by him
    Countess of Dorchester.]Congratulated the new Lord Treasurer, Sir Thomas
Osborne, a gentleman with whom I had been intimately acquainted at
Paris, and who was every day at my father-in-law's house and table
there; on which account I was too confident of succeeding in his favor,
as I had done in his predecessor's; but such a friend shall I never
find, and I neglected my time, far from believing that my Lord Clifford
would have so rashly laid down his staff, as he did, to the amazement of
all the world, when it came to the test of his receiving the Communion,
which I am confident he forbore more from some promise he had entered
into to gratify the Duke, than from any prejudice to the Protestant
religion, though I found him wavering a pretty while.[Sidenote: LONDON]

23d June, 1673.To London, to accompany our Council who went in a body
to congratulate the new Lord Treasurer, no friend to it because promoted
by my Lord Arlington, whom he hated.Came visitors from Court to dine with me and see the
army still remaining encamped on Blackheath.[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th July, 1673.This evening I went to the funeral of my dear and
excellent friend, that good man and accomplished gentleman, Sir Robert
Murray, Secretary of Scotland.He was buried by order of his Majesty in
Westminster Abbey.I went to Tunbridge Wells, to visit my Lord Clifford,
late Lord Treasurer, who was there to divert his mind more than his
body; it was believed that he had so engaged himself to the Duke, that
rather than take the Test, without which he was not capable of holding
any office, he would resign that great and honorable station.This, I am
confident, grieved him to the heart, and at last broke it; for, though
he carried with him music, and people to divert him, and, when I came to
see him, lodged me in his own apartment, and would not let me go from
him, I found he was struggling in his mind; and being of a rough and
ambitious nature, he could not long brook the necessity he had brought
on himself, of submission to this conjuncture.Besides, he saw the Dutch
war, which was made much by his advice, as well as the shutting up of
the Exchequer, very unprosperous.These things his high spirit could not
support.Having stayed here two or three days, I obtained leave of my
Lord to return.In my way, I saw my Lord of Dorset's house at Knowle, near Sevenoaks, a
great old-fashioned house.To Council, where the business of transporting wool was
brought before us.I went to see the pictures of all the judges and
eminent men of the Long Robe, newly painted by Mr.Wright, and set up in
Guildhall, costing the city L1,000.Most of them are very like the
persons they represent, though I never took Wright to be any
considerable artist.I rode to Durdans, where I dined at my Lord
Berkeley's of Berkeley Castle, my old and noble friend, it being his
wedding anniversary, where I found the Duchess of Albemarle, and other
company, and returned home on that evening late.Came to visit me my Lord Chancellor, the Earl of
Shaftesbury.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th August, 1673.My Lord Clifford, being about this time returned
from Tunbridge, and preparing for Devonshire, I went to take my leave of
him at Wallingford House; he was packing up pictures, most of which were
of hunting wild beasts and vast pieces of bull-baiting, bear-baiting,
etc.I found him in his study, and restored to him several papers of
state, and others of importance, which he had furnished me with, on
engaging me to write the "History of the Holland War," with other
private letters of his acknowledgments to my Lord Arlington, who from a
private gentleman of a very noble family, but inconsiderable fortune,
had advanced him from almost nothing.The first thing was his being in
Parliament, then knighted, then made one of the Commissioners of sick
and wounded, on which occasion we sat long together; then, on the death
of Hugh Pollard, he was made Comptroller of the Household and Privy
Councillor, yet still my brother Commissioner; after the death of Lord
Fitz-Harding, Treasurer of the Household, he, by letters to Lord
Arlington, which that Lord showed me, begged of his Lordship to obtain
it for him as the very height of his ambition.These were written with
such submissions and professions of his patronage, as I had never seen
any more acknowledging.The Earl of Southampton then dying, he was made
one of the Commissioners of the Treasury.His Majesty inclining to put
it into one hand, my Lord Clifford, under pretense of making all his
interest for his patron, my Lord Arlington, cut the grass under his
feet, and procured it for himself, assuring the King that Lord Arlington
did not desire it.Indeed, my Lord Arlington protested to me that his
confidence in Lord Clifford made him so remiss and his affection to him
was so particular, that he was absolutely minded to devolve it on Lord
Clifford, all the world knowing how he himself affected ease and quiet,
now growing into years, yet little thinking of this go-by.This was the
great ingratitude Lord Clifford showed, keeping my Lord Arlington in
ignorance, continually assuring him he was pursuing his interest, which
was the Duke's into whose great favor Lord Clifford was now gotten; but
which certainly cost him the loss of all, namely, his going so
irrevocably far in his interest.For the rest, my Lord Clifford was a valiant, incorrupt gentleman,
ambitious, not covetous; generous, passionate, a most constant, sincere
friend, to me in particular, so as when he laid down his office, I was
at the end of all my hopes and endeavors.These were not for high
matters, but to obtain what his Majesty was really indebted to my
father-in-law, which was the utmost of my ambition, and which I had
undoubtedly obtained, if this friend had stood.Sir Thomas Osborn, who
succeeded him, though much more obliged to my father-in-law and his
family, and my long and old acquaintance, being of a more haughty and
far less obliging nature, I could hope for little; a man of excellent
natural parts; but nothing of generous or grateful.Taking leave of my Lord Clifford, he wrung me by the hand, and, looking
earnestly on me, bid me God-b'ye, adding, "Mr.Evelyn, I shall never see
thee more."said I, "my Lord, what's the meaning of this?I hope I
shall see you often, and as great a person again."Evelyn, do
not expect it, I will never see this place, this city, or Court again,"
or words of this sound.In this manner, not without almost mutual tears,
I parted from him; nor was it long after, but the news was that he was
dead, and I have heard from some who I believe knew, he made himself
away, after an extraordinary melancholy.This is not confidently
affirmed, but a servant who lived in the house, and afterward with Sir
Robert Clayton, Lord Mayor, did, as well as others, report it, and when
I hinted some such thing to Mr.Prideaux, one of his trustees, he was
not willing to enter into that discourse.It was reported with these particulars, that, causing his servant to
leave him unusually one morning, locking himself in, he strangled
himself with his cravat upon the bed-tester; his servant, not liking the
manner of dismissing him, and looking through the keyhole (as I
remember), and seeing his master hanging, broke in before he was quite
dead, and taking him down, vomiting a great deal of blood, he was heard
to utter these words: "Well; let men say what they will, there is a God,
a just God above"; after which he spoke no more.This, if true, is
dismal.Really, he was the chief occasion of the Dutch war, and of all
that blood which was lost at Bergen in attacking the Smyrna fleet, and
that whole quarrel.This leads me to call to mind what my Lord Chancellor Shaftesbury
affirmed, not to me only, but to all my brethren the Council of Foreign
Plantations, when not long after, this accident being mentioned as we
were one day sitting in Council, his Lordship told us this remarkable
passage: that, being one day discoursing with him when he was only Sir
Thomas Clifford, speaking of men's advancement to great charges in the
nation, "Well," says he, "my Lord, I shall be one of the greatest men in
England.Don't impute what I say either to fancy, or vanity; I am
certain that I shall be a mighty man; but it will not last long; I shall
not hold it, but die a bloody death.""What," says my Lord, "your
horoscope tells you so?""No matter for that, it will be as I tell you.""Well," says my Lord Chancellor Shaftesbury, "if I were of that opinion,
I either would not be a great man, but decline preferment, or prevent my
danger."This my Lord affirmed in my hearing before several gentlemen and
noblemen sitting in council at Whitehall.And I the rather am confident
of it, remembering what Sir Edward Walker (Garter King-at-Arms) had
likewise affirmed to me a long time before, even when he was first made
a Lord; that carrying his pedigree to Lord Clifford on his being created
a peer, and, finding him busy, he bade him go into his study and divert
himself there till he was at leisure to discourse with him about some
things relating to his family; there lay, said Sir Edward, on his table,
his horoscope and nativity calculated, with some writing under it, where
he read that he should be advanced to the highest degree in the state
that could be conferred upon him, but that he should not long enjoy it,
but should die, or expressions to that sense; and I think, (but cannot
confidently say) a bloody death.This Sir Edward affirmed both to me and
Sir Richard Browne; nor could I forbear to note this extraordinary
passage in these memoirs.Creighton, son to the late eloquent Bishop of
Bath and Wells, preached to the Household on Isaiah, lvii.I procured L4,000 of the Lords of the Treasury,
and rectified divers matters about the sick and wounded.Bernard
Grenville, at Abs Court in Surrey; an old house in a pretty park.I went to see Paradise, a room in Hatton Garden
furnished with a representation of all sorts of animals handsomely
painted on boards or cloth, and so cut out and made to stand, move, fly,
crawl, roar, and make their several cries.The man who showed it, made
us laugh heartily at his formal poetry.To Council, about sending succors to recover New
York: and then we read the commission and instructions to Sir Jonathan
Atkins, the new Governor of Barbadoes.This night the youths of the city burned the Pope in
effigy, after they had made procession with it in great triumph, they
being displeased at the Duke for altering his religion and marrying an
Italian lady.Andrew's day I first saw the new Duchess of
York, and the Duchess of Modena, her mother.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st December, 1673.To Gresham College, whither the city had invited the
Royal Society by many of their chief aldermen and magistrates, who gave
us a collation, to welcome us to our first place of assembly, from
whence we had been driven to give place to the City, on their making it
their Exchange on the dreadful conflagration, till their new Exchange
was finished, which it now was.The Society having till now been
entertained and having met at Arundel House.I dined with some friends, and visited the sick;
thence, to an almshouse, where was prayers and relief, some very ill and
miserable.It was one of the best days I ever spent in my life.There was at dinner my Lord Lockhart, designed
Ambassador for France, a gallant and sober person.I saw again the Italian Duchess and her brother, the
Prince Reynaldo.I had some discourse with certain strangers, not
unlearned, who had been born not far from Old Nineveh; they assured me
of the ruins being still extant, and vast and wonderful were the
buildings, vaults, pillars, and magnificent fragments;[34] but they
could say little of the Tower of Babel that satisfied me.But the
description of the amenity and fragrancy of the country for health and
cheerfulness, delighted me; so sensibly they spoke of the excellent air
and climate in respect of our cloudy and splenetic country.[Footnote 34: The remarkable discoveries of Mr.Layard give now a
    curious interest to this notice by Evelyn.]Visited the prisoners at Ludgate, taking orders
about the releasing of some.I gave Almighty God thanks for his infinite
goodness to me the year past, and begged his mercy and protection the
year following; afterward, invited my neighbors to spend the day with
me.I saw an Italian opera in music, the first that
had been in England of this kind.Sent for by his Majesty to write something against
the Hollanders about the duty of the Flag and Fishery.I dined at Knightsbridge, with the Bishops of
Salisbury, Chester, and Lincoln, my old friends.Demalhoy,
Roger L'Estrange, and several of my friends, came to dine with me on the
happy occasion.Dryden, the famous poet and now laureate, came to
give me a visit.It was the anniversary of my marriage, and the first
day I went into my new little cell and cabinet, which I built below
toward the south court, at the east end of the parlor.Jacombe's son's share in
the mill and land at Deptford, which I bought of the Beechers.I went to Windsor with my wife and son to see my
daughter Mary, who was there with my Lady Tuke and to do my duty to his
Majesty.Next day, to a great entertainment at Sir Robert Holmes's at
Cranbourne Lodge, in the Forest; there were his Majesty, the Queen,
Duke, Duchess, and all the Court.I returned in the evening with Sir
Joseph Williamson, now declared Secretary of State.He was son of a poor
clergyman somewhere in Cumberland, brought up at Queen's College,
Oxford, of which he came to be a fellow; then traveled with... and
returning when the King was restored, was received as a clerk under Mr.Sir Henry Bennett (now Lord Arlington) succeeding,
Williamson is transferred to him, who loving his ease more than business
(though sufficiently able had he applied himself to it) remitted all to
his man Williamson; and, in a short time, let him so into the secret of
affairs, that (as his Lordship himself told me) there was a kind of
necessity to advance him; and so, by his subtlety, dexterity, and
insinuation, he got now to be principal Secretary; absolutely Lord
Arlington's creature, and ungrateful enough.It has been the fate of
this obliging favorite to advance those who soon forgot their original.Sir Joseph was a musician, could play at _Jeu de Goblets_, exceedingly
formal, a severe master to his servants, but so inward with my Lord
O'Brien, that after a few months of that gentleman's death, he married
his widow,[35] who, being sister and heir of the Duke of Richmond,
brought him a noble fortune.It was thought they lived not so kindly
after marriage as they did before.She was much censured for marrying so
meanly, being herself allied to the Royal family.[Footnote 35: Lady Catherine Stuart, sister and heir to Charles
    Stuart, Duke of Richmond and Lennox, the husband of Mrs.Frances
    Stuart, one of the most admired beauties of the Court, with whom
    Charles II.was so deeply in love that he never forgave the Duke for
    marrying her, having already, it is thought, formed some similar
    intention himself.He took the first opportunity of sending the Duke
    into an honorable exile, as Ambassador to Denmark, where he shortly
    after died, leaving no issue by the Duchess.][Sidenote: GROOMBRIDGE]

6th August, 1674.I went to Groombridge, to see my old friend, Mr.Packer; the house built within a moat, in a woody valley.The old house
had been the place of confinement of the Duke of Orleans, taken by one
Waller (whose house it then was) at the battle of Agincourt, now
demolished, and a new one built in its place, though a far better
situation had been on the south of the wood, on a graceful ascent.At
some small distance, is a large chapel, not long since built by Mr.Packer's father, on a vow he made to do it on the return of King Charles
I. out of Spain, 1625, and dedicated to St.Charles, but what saint
there was then of that name I am to seek, for, being a Protestant, I
conceive it was not Borromeo.I went to see my farm at Ripe, near Lewes.His Majesty told me how exceedingly the Dutch were
displeased at my treatise of the "History of Commerce;" that the Holland
Ambassador had complained to him of what I had touched of the Flags and
Fishery, etc., and desired the book might be called in; while on the
other side, he assured me he was exceedingly pleased with what I had
done, and gave me many thanks.Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.However, it being just upon conclusion of
the treaty of Breda (indeed it was designed to have been published some
months before and when we were at defiance), his Majesty told me he must
recall it formally; but gave order that what copies should be publicly
seized to pacify the Ambassador, should immediately be restored to the
printer, and that neither he nor the vender should be molested.The
truth is, that which touched the Hollander was much less than what the
King himself furnished me with, and obliged me to publish, having caused
it to be read to him before it went to press; but the error was, it
should have been published before the peace was proclaimed.The noise of
this book's suppression made it presently to be bought up, and turned
much to the stationer's advantage.It was no other than the preface
prepared to be prefixed to my "History of the Whole War;" which I now
pursued no further.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st August, 1674.In one of the meadows at the foot of the long
Terrace below the Castle [Windsor], works were thrown up to show the
King a representation of the city of Maestricht, newly taken by the
French.Bastians, bulwarks, ramparts, palisadoes, graffs, horn-works,
counter-scarps, etc., were constructed.It was attacked by the Duke of
Monmouth (newly come from the real siege) and the Duke of York, with a
little army, to show their skill in tactics.On Saturday night they made
their approaches, opened trenches, raised batteries, took the
counter-scarp and ravelin, after a stout defense; great guns fired on
both sides, grenadoes shot, mines sprung, parties sent out, attempts of
raising the siege, prisoners taken, parleys; and, in short, all the
circumstances of a formal siege, to appearance, and, what is most
strange all without disorder, or ill accident, to the great satisfaction
of a thousand spectators.The
siege being over, I went with Mr.Pepys back to London, where we arrived
about three in the morning.To Council, about fetching away the English left
at Surinam, etc., since our reconciliation with Holland.I went to see the great loss that Lord Arlington
had sustained by fire at Goring House, this night consumed to the
ground, with exceeding loss of hangings, plate, rare pictures, and
cabinets; hardly anything was saved of the best and most princely
furniture that any subject had in England.My lord and lady were both
absent at the Bath.The Lord Chief Baron Turner, and Sergeant Wild,
Recorder of London, came to visit me.At Lord Berkeley's, I discoursed with Sir Thomas
Modiford, late Governor of Jamaica, and with Colonel Morgan, who
undertook that gallant exploit from Nombre de Dios to Panama, on the
Continent of America; he told me 10,000 men would easily conquer all the
Spanish Indies, they were so secure.They took great booty, and much
greater had been taken, had they not been betrayed and so discovered
before their approach, by which the Spaniards had time to carry their
vast treasure on board ships that put off to sea in sight of our men,
who had no boats to follow.They set fire to Panama, and ravaged the
country sixty miles about.The Spaniards were so supine and unexercised,
that they were afraid to fire a great gun.My birthday, 54th year of my life.It was also preparation day for the Holy Sacrament, in which I
participated the next day, imploring God's protection for the year
following, and confirming my resolutions of a more holy life, even upon
the Holy Book.The anniversary of my baptism: I first heard that
famous and excellent preacher, Dr.Burnet, author of the "History of the
Reformation" on Colossians iii.10, with such flow of eloquence and
fullness of matter, as showed him to be a person oL extraordinary parts.Being her Majesty's birthday, the Court was exceeding splendid in
clothes and jewels, to the height of excess.To Council, on the business of Surinam, where the
Dutch had detained some English in prison, ever since the first war,
1665.I heard that stupendous violin, Signor Nicholao
(with other rare musicians), whom I never heard mortal man exceed on
that instrument.He had a stroke so sweet, and made it speak like the
voice of a man, and, when he pleased, like a concert of several
instruments.He did wonders upon a note, and was an excellent composer.Here was also that rare lutanist, Dr.Wallgrave; but nothing approached
the violin in Nicholao's hand.He played such ravishing things as
astonished us all.Slingsby's, master of the mint, my worthy
friend, a great lover of music.Heard Signor Francisco on the
harpsichord, esteemed one of the most excellent masters in Europe on
that instrument; then, came Nicholao with his violin, and struck all
mute, but Mrs.Knight, who sung incomparably, and doubtless has the
greatest reach of any English woman; she had been lately roaming in
Italy, and was much improved in that quality.Saw a comedy at night, at Court, acted by the
ladies only, among them Lady Mary and Ann, his Royal Highness' two
daughters, and my dear friend Mrs.Blagg, who, having the principal
part, performed it to admiration.Was at the repetition of the "Pastoral," on which
occasion Mrs.Blagg had about her near L20,000 worth of jewels, of which
she lost one worth about L80, borrowed of the Countess of Suffolk.The
press was so great, that it is a wonder she lost no more.Streeter, that excellent painter
of perspective and landscape, to comfort and encourage him to be cut for
the stone, with which that honest man was exceedingly afflicted.[Sidenote: LONDON]

22d March, 1675.Supped at Sir William Petty's, with the Bishop of
Salisbury, and divers honorable persons.We had a noble entertainment in
a house gloriously furnished; the master and mistress of it were
extraordinary persons.Sir William was the son of a mean man somewhere
in Sussex, and sent from school to Oxford, where he studied Philosophy,
but was most eminent in Mathematics and Mechanics; proceeded Doctor of
Physic, and was grown famous, as for his learning so for his recovering
a poor wench that had been hanged for felony; and her body having been
begged (as the custom is) for the anatomy lecture, he bled her, put her
to bed to a warm woman, and, with spirits and other means, restored her
to life.The young scholars joined and made a little portion, and
married her to a man who had several children by her, she living fifteen
years after, as I have been assured.Sir William came from Oxford to be
tutor to a neighbor of mine; thence, when the rebels were dividing their
conquests in Ireland, he was employed by them to measure and set out the
land, which he did on an easy contract, so much per acre.This he
effected so exactly, that it not only furnished him with a great sum of
money; but enabled him to purchase an estate worth L4,000 a year.He
afterward married the daughter of Sir Hardress Waller; she was an
extraordinary wit as well as beauty, and a prudent woman.Sir William, among other inventions, was author of the double-bottomed
ship, which perished, and he was censured for rashness, being lost in
the Bay of Biscay in a storm, when, I think, fifteen other vessels
miscarried.This vessel was flat-bottomed, of exceeding use to put into
shallow ports, and ride over small depths of water.It consisted of two
distinct keels cramped together with huge timbers, etc., so as that a
violent stream ran between; it bore a monstrous broad sail, and he still
persists that it is practicable, and of exceeding use; and he has often
told me he would adventure himself in such another, could he procure
sailors, and his Majesty's permission to make a second Experiment; which
name the King gave the vessel at the launching.The Map of Ireland made by Sir William Petty is believed to be the most
exact that ever yet was made of any country.He did promise to publish
it; and I am told it has cost him near L1,000 to have it engraved at
Amsterdam.There is not a better Latin poet living, when he gives
himself that diversion; nor is his excellence less in Council and
prudent matters of state; but he is so exceedingly nice in sifting and
examining all possible contingencies, that he adventures at nothing
which is not demonstration.There was not in the whole world his equal
for a superintendent of manufacture and improvement of trade, or to
govern a plantation.If I were a Prince, I should make him my second
Counsellor, at least.He is, besides,
courageous; on which account, I cannot but note a true story of him,
that when Sir Aleyn Brodrick sent him a challenge upon a difference
between them in Ireland, Sir William, though exceedingly purblind,
accepted the challenge, and it being his part to propound the weapon,
desired his antagonist to meet him with a hatchet, or axe, in a dark
cellar; which the other, of course, refused.Sir William was, with all this, facetious and of easy conversation,
friendly and courteous, and had such a faculty of imitating others, that
he would take a text and preach, now like a grave orthodox divine, then
falling into the Presbyterian way, then to the fanatical, the Quaker,
the monk and friar, the Popish priest, with such admirable action, and
alteration of voice and tone, as it was not possible to abstain from
wonder, and one would swear to hear several persons, or forbear to think
he was not in good earnest an enthusiast and almost beside himself;
then, he would fall out of it into a serious discourse; but it was very
rarely he would be prevailed on to oblige the company with this faculty,
and that only among most intimate friends.My Lord Duke of Ormond once
obtained it of him, and was almost ravished with admiration; but by and
by, he fell upon a serious reprimand of the faults and miscarriages of
some Princes and Governors, which, though he named none, did so sensibly
touch the Duke, who was then Lieutenant of Ireland, that he began to be
very uneasy, and wished the spirit laid which he had raised, for he was
neither able to endure such truths, nor could he but be delighted.At
last, he melted his discourse to a ridiculous subject, and came down
from the joint stool on which he had stood; but my lord would not have
him preach any more.He never could get favor at Court, because he
outwitted all the projectors that came near him.Having never known such
another genius, I cannot but mention these particulars, among a
multitude of others which I could produce.When I, who knew him in mean
circumstances, have been in his splendid palace, he would himself be in
admiration how he arrived at it; nor was it his value or inclination for
splendid furniture and the curiosities of the age, but his elegant lady
could endure nothing mean, or that was not magnificent.He was very
negligent himself, and rather so of his person, and of a philosophic
temper.would he say, "I can lie in straw with
as much satisfaction."He is author of the ingenious deductions from the bills of mortality,
which go under the name of Mr.Graunt; also of that useful discourse of
the manufacture of wool, and several others in the register of the Royal
Society.He was also author of that paraphrase on the 104th Psalm in
Latin verse, which goes about in MS., and is inimitable.In a word,
there is nothing impenetrable to him.Brideoak was elected Bishop of Chichester, on the
translation of Dr.3, the necessity
of those who are baptized to die to sin; a very excellent discourse from
an excellent preacher.Barrow, that excellent, pious, and most learned
man, divine, mathematician, poet, traveler, and most humble person,
preached at Whitehall to the household, on Luke xx.27, of love and
charity to our neighbors.I read my first discourse, "Of Earth and Vegetation,"
before the Royal Society as a lecture in course, after Sir Robert
Southwell had read his, the week before, "On Water."I was commanded by
our President and the suffrage of the Society, to print it.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th May, 1675.Blagg, married at the
Temple Church to my friend, Mr.Sidney Godolphin, Groom of the
Bedchamber to his Majesty.Bathurst, a Spanish merchant, my
neighbor.I went with Lord Ossory to Deptford, where we chose him
Master of the Trinity Company.I was at a conference of the Lords and Commons in the
Painted Chamber, on a difference about imprisoning some of their
members; and on the 3d, at another conference, when the Lords accused
the Commons for their transcendent misbehavior, breach of privilege,
Magna Charta, subversion of government, and other high, provoking, and
diminishing expressions, showing what duties and subjection they owed to
the Lords in Parliament, by record of Henry IV.This was likely to
create a notable disturbance.This afternoon came Monsieur Querouaille and his lady,
parents to the famous beauty and... favorite at Court, to see Sir R.
Browne, with whom they were intimately acquainted in Bretagne, at the
time Sir Richard was sent to Brest to supervise his Majesty's sea
affairs, during the latter part of the King's banishment.This
gentleman's house was not a mile from Brest; Sir Richard made an
acquaintance there, and, being used very civilly, was obliged to return
it here, which we did.He seemed a soldierly person and a good fellow,
as the Bretons generally are; his lady had been very handsome, and
seemed a shrewd understanding woman.Conversing with him in our garden,
I found several words of the Breton language the same with our Welsh.His daughter was now made Duchess of Portsmouth, and in the height of
favor; but he never made any use of it.At Ely House, I went to the consecration of my worthy
friend, the learned Dr.Barlow, Warden of Queen's College, Oxford, now
made Bishop of Lincoln.After it succeeded a magnificent feast, where
were the Duke of Ormond, Earl of Lauderdale, the Lord Treasurer, Lord
Keeper, etc.Howard and her two daughters toward
Northampton Assizes, about a trial at law, in which I was concerned for
them as a trustee.We lay this night at Henley-on-the Thames, at our
attorney, Mr.Stephens's, who entertained us very handsomely.Next day,
dining at Shotover, at Sir Timothy Tyrill's, a sweet place, we lay at
Oxford, where it was the time of the Act.Robert Spencer, uncle to
the Earl of Sunderland, and my old acquaintance in France, entertained
us at his apartment in Christ Church with exceeding generosity.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th July, 1675.Bathurst (who had formerly
taken particular care of my son), President of Trinity College invited
me to dinner, and did me great honor all the time of my stay.The next
day, he invited me and all my company, though strangers to him, to a
very noble feast.I was at all the academic exercises.--Sunday, at St.Mary's, preached a Fellow of Brasen-nose, not a little magnifying the
dignity of Churchmen.We heard the speeches, and saw the ceremony of creating
doctors in Divinity, Law and Physic.I had, early in the morning, heard
Dr.Morison, Botanic Professor, read on divers plants in the Physic
Garden; and saw that rare collection of natural curiosities of Dr.Plot's, of Magdalen Hall, author of "The Natural History of
Oxfordshire," all of them collected in that shire, and indeed
extraordinary, that in one county there should be found such variety of
plants, shells, stones, minerals, marcasites, fowls, insects, models of
works, crystals, agates, and marbles.He was now intending to visit
Staffordshire, and, as he had of Oxfordshire, to give us the natural,
topical, political, and mechanical history.Pity it is that more of this
industrious man's genius were not employed so to describe every county
of England; it would be one of the most useful and illustrious works
that was ever produced in any age or nation.I visited also the Bodleian Library and my old friend, the learned
Obadiah Walker, head of University College, which he had now almost
rebuilt, or repaired.We then proceeded to Northampton, where we arrived
the next day.In this journey, went part of the way Mr.James Graham (since Privy
Purse to the Duke), a young gentleman exceedingly in love with Mrs.Dorothy Howard, one of the maids of honor in our company.I could not
but pity them both, the mother not much favoring it.This lady was not
only a great beauty, but a most virtuous and excellent creature, and
worthy to have been wife to the best of men.My advice was required, and
I spoke to the advantage of the young gentleman, more out of pity than
that she deserved no better match; for, though he was a gentleman of
good family, yet there was great inequality.I went to see my Lord Sunderland's Seat at Althorpe,
four miles from the ragged town of Northampton (since burned, and well
rebuilt).It is placed in a pretty open bottom, very finely watered and
flanked with stately woods and groves in a park, with a canal, but the
water is not running, which is a defect.The house, a kind of modern
building, of freestone, within most nobly furnished; the apartments very
commodious, a gallery and noble hall; but the kitchen being in the body
of the house, and chapel too small, were defects.There is an old yet
honorable gatehouse standing awry, and out-housing mean, but designed to
be taken away.It was moated round, after the old manner, but it is now
dry, and turfed with a beautiful carpet.Above all, are admirable and
magnificent the several ample gardens furnished with the choicest fruit,
and exquisitely kept.Great plenty of oranges, and other curiosities.The park full of fowl, especially herons, and from it a prospect to
Holmby House, which being demolished in the late civil wars, shows like
a Roman ruin shaded by the trees about it, a stately, solemn, and
pleasing view.Our cause was pleaded in behalf of the mother, Mrs.Howard and her daughters, before Baron Thurland, who had formerly been
steward of Courts for me; we carried our cause, as there was reason, for
here was an impudent as well as disobedient son against his mother, by
instigation, doubtless, of his wife, one Mrs.Ogle (an ancient maid),
whom he had clandestinely married, and who brought him no fortune, he
being heir-apparent to the Earl of Berkshire.We lay at Brickhill, in
Bedfordshire, and came late the next day to our journey's end.This was a journey of adventures and knight-errantry.One of the lady's
servants being as desperately in love with Mrs.Graham was with her daughter, and she riding on horseback behind his
rival, the amorous and jealous youth having a little drink in his pate,
had here killed himself had he not been prevented; for, alighting from
his horse, and drawing his sword, he endeavored twice or thrice to fall
on it, but was interrupted by our coachman, and a stranger passing by.After this, running to his rival, and snatching his sword from his side
(for we had beaten his own out of his hand), and on the sudden pulling
down his mistress, would have run both of them through; we parted them,
not without some blood.This miserable creature poisoned himself for her
not many days after they came to London.[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th July, 1675.The Lord Treasurer's Chaplain preached at Wallingford
House.Sprat, prebend of Westminster, and Chaplain to the
Duke of Buckingham, preached on the 3d Epistle of Jude, showing what the
primitive faith was, how near it and how excellent that of the Church of
England, also the danger of departing from it.I visited the Bishop of Rochester, at Bromley, and
dined at Sir Philip Warwick's, at Frogpoole [Frognall].I went to see Dulwich College, being the pious
foundation of one Alleyn, a famous comedian, in King James's time.The
chapel is pretty, the rest of the hospital very ill contrived; it yet
maintains divers poor of both sexes.It is in a melancholy part of
Camberwell parish.I came back by certain medicinal Spa waters, at a
place called Sydenham Wells, in Lewisham parish, much frequented in
summer.I was casually shown the Duchess of Portsmouth's
splendid apartment at Whitehall, luxuriously furnished, and with ten
times the richness and glory beyond the Queen's; such massy pieces of
plate, whole tables, and stands of incredible value.I saw the Italian Scaramuccio act before the King
at Whitehall, people giving money to come in, which was very scandalous,
and never so before at Court diversions.Having seen him act before in
Italy, many years past, I was not averse from seeing the most excellent
of that kind of folly.Dined at Kensington with my old acquaintance, Mr.Henshaw, newly returned from Denmark, where he had been left resident
after the death of the Duke of Richmond, who died there Ambassador.I got an extreme cold, such as was afterward so
epidemical, as not only to afflict us in this island, but was rife over
all Europe, like a plague.It was after an exceedingly dry summer and
autumn.I settled affairs, my son being to go into France with my Lord Berkeley,
designed Ambassador-extraordinary for France and Plenipotentiary for the
general treaty of peace at Nimeguen.Dined at Lord Chamberlain's with the Holland
Ambassador L. Duras, a valiant gentleman whom his Majesty made an
English Baron, of a cadet, and gave him his seat of Holmby, in
Northamptonshire.Lord Berkeley coming into Council, fell down in the
gallery at Whitehall, in a fit of apoplexy, and being carried into my
Lord Chamberlain's lodgings, several famous doctors were employed all
that night, and with much ado he was at last recovered to some sense, by
applying hot fire pans and spirit of amber to his head; but nothing was
found so effectual as cupping him on the shoulders.It was almost a
miraculous restoration.The next day he was carried to Berkeley House.This stopped his journey for the present, and caused my stay in town.He
had put all his affairs and his whole estate in England into my hands
during his intended absence, which though I was very unfit to undertake,
in regard of many businesses which then took me up, yet, upon the great
importunity of my lady and Mr.Godolphin (to whom I could refuse
nothing) I did take it on me.It seems when he was Deputy in Ireland,
not long before, he had been much wronged by one he left in trust with
his affairs, and therefore wished for some unmercenary friend who would
take that trouble on him; this was to receive his rents, look after his
houses and tenants, solicit supplies from the Lord Treasurer, and
correspond weekly with him, more than enough to employ any drudge in
England; but what will not friendship and love make one do?Dined at my Lord Chamberlain's, with my son.There
were the learned Isaac Vossius, and Spanhemius, son of the famous man of
Heidelberg; nor was this gentleman less learned, being a general
scholar.Among other pieces, he was author of an excellent treatise on
Medals.Being the day appointed for my Lord Ambassador to
set out, I met them with my coach at New Cross.There were with him my
Lady his wife, and my dear friend, Mrs.Godolphin, who, out of an
extraordinary friendship, would needs accompany my lady to Paris, and
stay with her some time, which was the chief inducement for permitting
my son to travel, but I knew him safe under her inspection, and in
regard my Lord himself had promised to take him into his special favor,
he having intrusted all he had to my care.Thus we set out three coaches (besides mine), three wagons, and about
forty horses.It being late, and my Lord as yet but valetudinary, we got
but to Dartford, the first day, the next to Sittingbourne.Cony, then an officer of mine for the sick
and wounded of that place, gave the ladies a handsome refreshment as we
came by his house.[Sidenote: DOVER]

12th November, 1675.We came to Canterbury: and, next morning, to Dover.There was in my Lady Ambassadress's company my Lady Hamilton, a
sprightly young lady, much in the good graces of the family, wife of
that valiant and worthy gentleman, George Hamilton, not long after slain
in the wars.She had been a maid of honor to the Duchess, and now turned
<DW7>.Being Sunday, my Lord having before delivered to me
his letter of attorney, keys, seal, and his Will, we took a solemn leave
of one another upon the beach, the coaches carrying them into the sea to
the boats, which delivered them to Captain Gunman's yacht, the "Mary."Being under sail, the castle gave them seventeen guns, which Captain
Gunman answered with eleven.Hence, I went to church, to beg a blessing
on their voyage.Being returned home, I visited Lady Mordaunt at
Parson's Green, my Lord, her son, being sick.This pious woman delivered
to me L100 to bestow as I thought fit for the release of poor prisoners,
and other charitable uses.Visited her Ladyship again, where I found the
Bishop of Winchester, whom I had long known in France; he invited me to
his house at Chelsea.Lady Sunderland gave me ten guineas, to bestow in
charities.Gunning, Bishop of Ely, preached before the
King from St.21, 22, 23, chiefly against an anonymous book,
called "Naked Truth," a famous and popular treatise against the
corruption in the Clergy, but not sound as to its quotations, supposed
to have been the Bishop of Hereford's and was answered by Dr.Turner, it
endeavoring to prove an equality of order of Bishop and Presbyter.Pritchard, Bishop of Gloucester, preached at
Whitehall, on Isaiah v.5, very allegorically, according to his manner,
yet very gravely and wittily.Povey, one of the Masters of
Requests, a nice contriver of all elegancies, and exceedingly formal.Supped with Sir J. Williamson, where were of our Society Mr.Robert
Boyle, Sir Christopher Wren, Sir William Petty, Dr.Holden, subdean of
his Majesty's Chapel, Sir James Shaen, Dr.Whistler, and our Secretary,
Mr.Sir Thomas Linch was returned from his government of
Jamaica.The Countess of Sunderland and I went by water to
Parson's Green, to visit my Lady Mordaunt, and to consult with her about
my Lord's monument.Lloyd, late Curate of Deptford, but now Bishop of
Llandaff, preached before the King, on 1 Cor.57, that though sin
subjects us to death, yet through Christ we become his conquerors.To Twickenham Park, Lord Berkeley's country seat, to
examine how the bailiffs and servants ordered matters.Brideoake, Bishop of Chichester, preached a mean
discourse for a Bishop.Fleetwood, Bishop of Worcester,
on Matt.38, of the sorrows of Christ, a deadly sorrow caused by
our sins; he was no great preacher.Dining with my Lady Sunderland, I saw a fellow swallow
a knife, and divers great pebble stones, which would make a plain
rattling one against another.The knife was in a sheath of horn.North, son of my Lord North, preached before the King, on Isaiah
liii.57, a very young but learned and excellent person.This was
the first time the Duke appeared no more in chapel, to the infinite
grief and threatened ruin of this poor nation.I had now notice that my dear friend Mrs.Godolphin, was
returning from Paris.On the 6th, she arrived to my great joy, whom I
most heartily welcomed.My wife entertained her Majesty at Deptford, for which
the Queen gave me thanks in the withdrawing room at Whitehall.The University of Oxford presented me with the "_Marmora Oxoniensia
Arundeliana_"; the Bishop of Oxford writing to desire that I would
introduce Mr.Prideaux, the editor (a young man most learned in
antiquities) to the Duke of Norfolk, to present another dedicated to his
Grace, which I did, and we dined with the Duke at Arundel House, and
supped at the Bishop of Rochester's with Isaac Vossius.I spoke to the Duke of York about my Lord Berkeley's
going to Nimeguen.Thence, to the Queen's Council at Somerset House,
about Mrs.Godolphin's lease of Spalding, in Lincolnshire.Montague's new palace, near Bloomsbury, built by Mr.Hooke, of our
Society, after the French manner.[36]

    [Footnote 36: Now the British Museum.]Returned home, and found my son returned from France;
praised be God!A chaplain of my Lord Ossory's preached,
after which we took barge to Trinity House in London.Pepys
(Secretary of the Admiralty) succeeded my Lord as Master.[Sidenote: ENFIELD]

2d June, 1676.I went with my Lord Chamberlain to see a garden, at
Enfield town; thence, to Mr.It
is a very pretty place, the house commodious, the gardens handsome, and
our entertainment very free, there being none but my Lord and myself.That which I most wondered at was, that, in the compass of twenty-five
miles, yet within fourteen of London, there is not a house, barn,
church, or building, besides three lodges.To this Lodge are three great
ponds, and some few inclosures, the rest a solitary desert, yet stored
with no less than 3,000 deer.These are pretty retreats for gentlemen,
especially for those who are studious and lovers of privacy.We returned in the evening by Hampstead, to see Lord Wotton's house and
garden (Bellsize House), built with vast expense by Mr.O'Neale, an
Irish gentleman who married Lord Wotton's mother, Lady Stanhope.The
furniture is very particular for Indian cabinets, porcelain, and other
solid and noble movables.The gallery very fine, the gardens very large,
but ill kept, yet woody and chargeable.The soil a cold weeping clay,
not answering the expense.I went to see Sir Thomas Bond's new and fine house by
Peckham; it is on a flat, but has a fine garden and prospect through the
meadows to London.Castillion, Prebend of Canterbury, preached before
the King, on John xv.Went to the funeral of Sir William Sanderson, husband
to the Mother of the Maids, and author of two large but mean histories
of King James and King Charles I. He was buried at Westminster.James's Chapel,
was christened a daughter of Dr.Leake's, the Duke's Chaplain:
godmothers were Lady Mary, daughter of the Duke of York, and the Duchess
of Monmouth: godfather, the Earl of Bath.Came to dine with me my Lord Halifax, Sir Thomas
Meeres, one of the Commissioners of the Admiralty, Sir John Clayton, Mr.Dined with Sir John Banks at his house in Lincoln's
Inn Fields, on recommending Mr.Upman to be tutor to his son going into
France.This Sir John Banks was a merchant of small beginning, but had
amassed L100,000.I dined at the Admiralty with Secretary Pepys, and
supped at the Lord Chamberlain's.Here was Captain Baker, who had been
lately on the attempt of the Northwest passage.He reported prodigious
depth of ice, blue as a sapphire, and as transparent.The thick mists
were their chief impediment, and cause of their return.I paid L1,700 to the Marquis de Sissac, which he had
lent to my Lord Berkeley, and which I heard the Marquis lost at play in
a night or two.The Dean of Chichester preached before the King, on Acts xxiv.Crichton preached the second sermon before him on Psalm xc.12, of
wisely numbering our days, and well employing our time.Dined at Captain Graham's, where I became acquainted
with Dr.Compton (brother to the Earl of Northampton), now Bishop of
London, and Mr.North, son to the Lord North, brother to the Lord
Chief-Justice and Clerk of the Closet, a most hopeful young man.The
Bishop had once been a soldier, had also traveled in Italy, and became a
most sober, grave, and excellent prelate.Supped at the Lord Chamberlain's, where also supped
the famous beauty and errant lady, the Duchess of Mazarine (all the
world knows her story), the Duke of Monmouth, Countess of Sussex (both
natural children of the King by the Duchess of Cleveland[37]), and the
Countess of Derby, a virtuous lady, daughter to my best friend, the Earl
of Ossory.[Footnote 37: Evelyn makes a slip here.The Duke of Monmouth's
    mother was, it is well known, Lucy Walters, sometimes called Mrs.Barlow, and heretofore mentioned in the "Diary."Nor is he more
    correct as to the Countess of Sussex.Lady Anne Fitzroy, as she is
    called in the Peerage books, was married to Lennard Dacre, Earl of
    Sussex, by whom she left a daughter only, who succeeded on her
    father's death to the Barony of Dacre.On the other hand, the Duke
    of Southampton, the Duke of Grafton, and the Duke of Northumberland,
    were all of them children of Charles II.by the Duchess of
    Cleveland.]Flamsted, the learned astrologer
and mathematician, whom his Majesty had established in the new
Observatory in Greenwich Park, furnished with the choicest instruments.To London, to take order about the building of a
house, or rather an apartment, which had all the conveniences of a
house, for my dear friend, Mr.Godolphin and lady, which I undertook to
contrive and survey, and employ workmen until it should be quite
finished; it being just over against his Majesty's wood-yard by the
Thames side, leading to Scotland Yard.To Lambeth, to that rare magazine of marble, to
take order for chimney-pieces, etc., for Mr.The
owner of the works had built for himself a pretty dwelling house; this
Dutchman had contracted with the Genoese for all their marble.We also
saw the Duke of Buckingham's glasswork, where they made huge vases of
metal as clear, ponderous, and thick as crystal; also looking-glasses
far larger and better than any that come from Venice.Godolphin and my wife to Blackwall,
to see some Indian curiosities; the streets being slippery, I fell
against a piece of timber with such violence that I could not speak nor
fetch my breath for some space; being carried into a house and let
blood, I was removed to the water-side and so home, where, after a day's
rest, I recovered.This being one of my greatest deliverances, the Lord
Jesus make me ever mindful and thankful!Being my birthday, and fifty-six years old, I spent
the morning in devotion and imploring God's protection, with solemn
thanksgiving for all his signal mercies to me, especially for that
escape which concerned me this month at Blackwall.Godolphin, and returned home through a prodigious and dangerous mist.Finished the lease of Spalding, for Mr.My son and I dining at my Lord Chamberlain's, he
showed us among others that incomparable piece of Raphael's, being a
Minister of State dictating to Guicciardini, the earnestness of whose
face looking up in expectation of what he was next to write, is so to
the life, and so natural, as I esteem it one of the choicest pieces of
that admirable artist.There was a woman's head of Leonardo da Vinci; a
Madonna of old Palma, and two of Vandyke's, of which one was his own
picture at length, when young, in a leaning posture; the other, an
eunuch, singing.I saw the great ball danced by all the gallants and
ladies at the Duchess of York's.There fell so deep a snow as hindered us from
church.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th December, 1676.To London, in so great a snow, as I remember not
to have seen the like.More snow falling, I was not able to get to church.I went to Roehampton, with my Lady Duchess of
Ormond.The garden and perspective is pretty, the prospect most
agreeable.Came the Earl of Peterborough, to desire me to be a
trustee for Lord Viscount Mordaunt and the Countess, for the sale of
certain lands set out by Act of Parliament, to pay debts.I went to London, to give the Lord Ambassador Berkeley
(now returned from the treaty at Nimeguen) an account of the great trust
reposed in me during his absence, I having received and remitted to him
no less than L20,000 to my no small trouble and loss of time, that
during his absence, and when the Lord Treasurer was no great friend [of
his] I yet procured him great sums, very often soliciting his Majesty in
his behalf; looking after the rest of his estates and concerns entirely,
without once accepting any kind of acknowledgment, purely upon the
request of my dear friend, Mr.I returned with abundance of
thanks and professions from my Lord Berkeley and my Lady.This business being now at an end, and myself delivered
from that intolerable servitude and correspondence, I had leisure to be
somewhat more at home and to myself.I sealed the deeds of sale of the manor of Blechingley to
Sir Robert Clayton, for payment of Lord Peterborough's debts, according
to the trust of the Act of Parliament.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

16th July, 1677.Evans, curate of Abinger,
preached an excellent sermon on Matt.Duncomb's, at Sheere, whose house stands
environed with very sweet and quick streams.Bohun, my Son's late tutor, preached at Abinger, on
Phil., iv.I went to visit my Lord Brounker, now taking the
waters at Dulwich.Dined at the Earl of Peterborough's the day after the
marriage of my Lord of Arundel to Lady Mary Mordaunt, daughter of the
Earl of Peterborough.To visit my Lord Chamberlain, in Suffolk; he sent his
coach and six to meet and bring me from St.Edmund's Bury to Euston.We hunted in the Park and killed a very fat buck.I went to visit my Lord Crofts, now dying at St.Edmunds Bury, and took the opportunity to see this ancient town, and the
remains of that famous monastery and abbey.There is little standing
entire, save the gatehouse; it has been a vast and magnificent Gothic
structure, and of great extent.The gates are wood, but quite plated
over with iron.There are also two stately churches, one especially.I went to Thetford, to the borough-town, where
stand the ruins of a religious house: there is a round mountain
artificially raised, either for some castle, or monument, which makes a
pretty landscape.As we went and returned, a tumbler showed his
extraordinary address in the Warren.I also saw the Decoy; much pleased
with the stratagem.There dined this day at my Lord's one Sir John
Gaudy, a very handsome person, but quite dumb, yet very intelligent by
signs, and a very fine painter; he was so civil and well bred, as it was
not possible to discern any imperfection in him.His lady and children
were also there, and he was at church in the morning with us.A stranger preached at Euston Church, and fell into
a handsome panegyric on my Lord's new building the church, which indeed
for its elegance and cheerfulness, is one of the prettiest country
churches in England.My Lord told me his heart smote him that, after he
had bestowed so much on his magnificent palace there, he should see
God's House in the ruin it lay in.He has also rebuilt the
parsonage-house, all of stone, very neat and ample.[Sidenote: EUSTON]

10th September, 1677.To divert me, my Lord would needs carry me to see
Ipswich, when we dined with one Mr.Mann by the way, who was Recorder of
the town.There were in our company my Lord Huntingtower, son to the
Duchess of Lauderdale, Sir Edward Bacon, a learned gentleman of the
family of the great Chancellor Verulam, and Sir John Felton, with some
other knights and gentlemen.After dinner came the bailiff and
magistrates in their formalities with their maces to compliment my Lord,
and invite him to the town-house, where they presented us a collation of
dried sweetmeats and wine, the bells ringing, etc.Then, we went to see
the town, and first, the Lord Viscount Hereford's house, which stands in
a park near the town, like that at Brussels, in Flanders; the house not
great, yet pretty, especially the hall.The stews for fish succeeded one
another, and feed one the other, all paved at bottom.There is a good
picture of the blessed virgin in one of the parlors, seeming to be of
Holbein, or some good master.Then we saw the Haven, seven miles from
Harwich.The tide runs out every day, but the bedding being soft mud, it
is safe for shipping and a station.The trade of Ipswich is for the most
part Newcastle coals, with which they supply London; but it was formerly
a clothing town.There is not any beggar asks alms in the whole place, a
thing very extraordinary, so ordered by the prudence of the magistrates.It has in it fourteen or fifteen beautiful churches: in a word, it is
for building, cleanness, and good order, one of the best towns in
England.Cardinal Wolsey was a butcher's son of Ipswich, but there is
little of that magnificent Prelate's foundation here, besides a school
and I think a library, which I did not see.His intentions were to build
some great thing.We returned late to Euston, having traveled about
fifty miles this day.Since first I was at this place, I found things exceedingly improved.It is seated in a bottom between two graceful swellings, the main
building being now in the figure of a Greek II with four pavilions, two
at each corner, and a break in the front, railed and balustered at the
top, where I caused huge jars to be placed full of earth to keep them
steady upon their pedestals between the statues, which make as good a
show as if they were of stone, and, though the building be of brick, and
but two stories besides cellars and garrets covered with blue slate, yet
there is room enough for a full court, the offices and outhouses being
so ample and well disposed.The King's apartment is painted _a fresco_,
and magnificently furnished.There are many excellent pictures of the
great masters.The gallery is a pleasant, noble room; in the break, or
middle, is a billiard table, but the wainscot, being of fir, and
painted, does not please me so well as Spanish oak without paint.The
chapel is pretty, the porch descending to the gardens.The orange garden
is very fine, and leads into the greenhouse, at the end of which is a
hall to eat in, and the conservatory some hundred feet long, adorned
with maps, as the other side is with the heads of the Caesars, ill cut in
alabaster; above are several apartments for my Lord, Lady, and Duchess,
with kitchens and other offices below, in a lesser form; lodgings for
servants, all distinct for them to retire to when they please and would
be in private, and have no communication with the palace, which he tells
me he will wholly resign to his son-in-law and daughter, that charming
young creature.The canal running under my Lady's dressing room chamber window, is full
of carps and fowl, which come and are fed there.The cascade at the end
of the canal turns a cornmill that provides the family, and raises water
for the fountains and offices.To pass this canal into the opposite
meadows, Sir Samuel Morland has invented a screw bridge, which, being
turned with a key, lands you fifty feet distant at the entrance of an
ascending walk of trees, a mile in length,--as it is also on the front
into the park,--of four rows of ash trees, and reaches to the park pale,
which is nine miles in compass, and the best for riding and meeting the
game that I ever saw.There were now of red and fallow deer almost a
thousand, with good covert, but the soil barren and flying sand, in
which nothing will grow kindly.The tufts of fir, and much of the other
wood, were planted by my direction some years before.This seat is
admirably placed for field sports, hawking, hunting, or racing.The
mutton is small, but sweet.The stables hold thirty horses and four
coaches.The out-offices make two large quadrangles, so as servants
never lived with more ease and convenience; never master more civil.Strangers are attended and accommodated as at their home, in pretty
apartments furnished with all manner of conveniences and privacy.There is a library full of excellent books; bathing rooms, elaboratory,
dispensary, a decoy, and places to keep and fat fowl in.He had now in
his new church (near the garden) built a dormitory, or vault, with
several repositories, in which to bury his family.In the expense of this pious structure, the church is most laudable,
most of the houses of God in this country resembling rather stables and
thatched cottages than temples in which to serve the Most High.He has
built a lodge in the park for the keeper, which is a neat dwelling, and
might become any gentleman.The same has he done for the parson, little
deserving it for murmuring that my Lord put him some time out of his
wretched hovel, while it was building.He has also erected a fair inn at
some distance from his palace, with a bridge of stone over a river near
it, and repaired all the tenants' houses, so as there is nothing but
neatness and accommodations about his estate, which I yet think is not
above L1,500 a year.I believe he had now in his family one hundred
domestic servants.His lady (being one of the Brederode's daughters, grandchild to a
natural son of Henry Frederick, Prince of Orange) is a good-natured and
obliging woman.They love fine things, and to live easily, pompously,
and hospitably; but, with so vast expense, as plunges my Lord into debts
exceedingly.My Lord himself is given into no expensive vice but
building, and to have all things rich, polite, and princely.He never
plays, but reads much, having the Latin, French, and Spanish tongues in
perfection.He has traveled much, and is the best bred and courtly
person his Majesty has about him, so as the public Ministers more
frequent him than any of the rest of the nobility.While he was
Secretary of State and Prime Minister, he had gotten vastly, but spent
it as hastily, even before he had established a fund to maintain his
greatness; and now beginning to decline in favor (the Duke being no
great friend of his), he knows not how to retrench.He was son of a
Doctor of Laws, whom I have seen, and, being sent from Westminster
School to Oxford, with intention to be a divine, and parson of
Arlington, a village near Brentford, when Master of Arts the Rebellion
falling out, he followed the King's Army, and receiving an HONORABLE
WOUND IN THE FACE, grew into favor, and was advanced from a mean
fortune, at his Majesty's Restoration, to be an Earl and Knight of the
Garter, Lord Chamberlain of the Household, and first favorite for a long
time, during which the King married his natural son, the Duke of
Grafton, to his only daughter and heiress, as before mentioned, worthy
for her beauty and virtue of the greatest prince in Christendom.My Lord
is, besides this, a prudent and understanding person in business, and
speaks well; unfortunate yet in those he has advanced, most of them
proving ungrateful.The many obligations and civilities I have received
from this noble gentleman, extracts from me this character, and I am
sorry he is in no better circumstances.Having now passed near three weeks at Euston, to my great satisfaction,
with much difficulty he suffered me to look homeward, being very earnest
with me to stay longer; and, to engage me, would himself have carried me
to Lynn-Regis, a town of important traffic, about twenty miles beyond,
which I had never seen; as also the Traveling Sands, about ten miles
wide of Euston, that have so damaged the country, rolling from place to
place, and, like the Sands in the Deserts of Lybia, quite overwhelmed
some gentlemen's whole estates, as the relation extant in print, and
brought to our Society, describes at large.My Lord's coach conveyed me to Bury, and thence
baiting at Newmarket, stepping in at Audley-End to see that house again,
I slept at Bishop-Stortford, and, the next day, home.I was accompanied
in my journey by Major Fairfax, of a younger house of the Lord Fairfax,
a soldier, a traveler, an excellent musician, a good-natured, well-bred
gentleman.Phillips (nephew of Milton) to the
service of my Lord Chamberlain, who wanted a scholar to read to and
entertain him sometimes.With Sir Robert Clayton to Marden, an estate he had
bought lately of my kinsman, Sir John Evelyn, of Godstone, in Surrey,
which from a despicable farmhouse Sir Robert had erected into a seat
with extraordinary expense.It is in such a solitude among hills, as,
being not above sixteen miles from London, seems almost incredible, the
ways up to it are so winding and intricate.The gardens are large, and
well-walled, and the husbandry part made very convenient and perfectly
understood.The barns, the stacks of corn, the stalls for cattle, pigeon
house, etc., of most laudable example.Innumerable are the plantations
of trees, especially walnuts.The orangery and gardens are very curious.He and his lady (who is very
curious in distillery) entertained me three or four days very freely.I
earnestly suggested to him the repairing of an old desolate dilapidated
church, standing on the hill above the house, which I left him in good
disposition to do, and endow it better; there not being above four or
five houses in the parish, besides that of this prodigious rich
Scrivener.This place is exceedingly sharp in the winter, by reason of
the serpentining of the hills: and it wants running water; but the
solitude much pleased me.All the ground is so full of wild thyme,
marjoram, and other sweet plants, that it cannot be overstocked with
bees; I think he had near forty hives of that industrious insect.I went to church at Godstone, and to see old Sir
John Evelyn's DORMITORY, joining to the church, paved with marble, where
he and his Lady lie on a very stately monument at length; he in armor of
white marble.The inscription is only an account of his particular
branch of the family, on black marble.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th October, 1677.Returned to London; in the evening, I saw the Prince
of Orange, and supped with Lord Ossory.Saw again the Prince of Orange; his marriage with the
Lady Mary, eldest daughter to the Duke of York, by Mrs.Hyde, the late
Duchess, was now declared.I was all this week composing matters between old
Mrs.Howard and Sir Gabriel Sylvius, upon his long and earnest addresses
to Mrs.Anne, her second daughter, maid of honor to the Queen.Godolphin (who exceedingly loved the young lady) was most
industrious in it, out of pity to the languishing knight; so as though
there were great differences in their years, it was at last effected,
and they were married the 13th, in Henry VII.'s Chapel, by the Bishop of
Rochester, there being besides my wife and Mrs.We dined at the old lady's, and supped at
Mr.The Queen's birthday, a great ball at Court, where
the Prince of Orange and his new Princess danced.They went away, and I saw embarked my Lady Sylvius,
who went into Holland with her husband, made Hoffmaester to the Prince,
a considerable employment.We parted with great sorrow, for the great
respect and honor I bore her, a most pious and virtuous lady.Dined at the Lord Treasurer's with Prince Rupert,
Viscount Falkenburg, Earl of Bath, Lord O'Brien, Sir John Lowther, Sir
Christopher Wren, Dr.Sir Joseph Williamson, Principal Secretary of
State, was chosen President of the Royal Society, after my Lord Viscount
Brouncker had possessed the chair now sixteen years successively, and
therefore now thought fit to CHANGE, that prescription might not
prejudice.Being the first day of his taking the chair, he gave
us a magnificent supper.Carried to my Lord Treasurer an account of the Earl
of Bristol's Library, at Wimbledon, which my Lord thought of purchasing,
till I acquainted him that it was a very broken collection, consisting
much in books of judicial astrology, romances, and trifles.I gave my son an office, with instructions how to
govern his youth; I pray God give him the grace to make a right use of
it!Dined with the Duke of Norfolk, being the first
time I had seen him since the death of his elder brother, who died at
Padua in Italy, where he had resided above thirty years.The Duke had
now newly declared his marriage to his concubine, whom he promised me he
never would marry.I went with him to see the Duke of Buckingham, thence
to my Lord Sunderland, now Secretary of State, to show him that rare
piece of Vosterman's (son of old Vosterman), which was a view, or
landscape of my Lord's palace, etc., at Althorpe in Northamptonshire.Supping at my Lord Chamberlain's I had a long
discourse with the Count de Castel Mellor, lately Prime Minister in
Portugal, who, taking part with his master, King Alphonso, was banished
by his brother, Don Pedro, now Regent; but had behaved himself so
uncorruptly in all his ministry that, though he was acquitted, and his
estate restored, yet would they not suffer him to return.He is a very
intelligent and worthy gentleman.My Lord Treasurer sent for me to accompany him to
Wimbledon, which he had lately purchased of the Earl of Bristol; so
breaking fast with him privately in his chamber, I accompanied him with
two of his daughters, my Lord Conway, and Sir Bernard Gascoyne; and,
having surveyed his gardens and alterations, returned late at night.[Sidenote: LONDON]

22d February, 1678.Pierce preached at Whitehall, on 2 Thessalonians
iii.6, against our late schismatics, in a rational discourse, but a
little over-sharp, and not at all proper for the auditory there.South preached _coram Rege_, an incomparable
discourse on this text, "A wounded spirit who can bear!"Note: Now was
our Communion table placed altarwise; the church steeple, clock, and
other reparations finished.I showed Don Emmanuel de Lyra (Portugal Ambassador)
and the Count de Castel Mellor, the Repository of the Royal Society, and
the College of Physicians.I went to see new Bedlam Hospital, magnificently
built, and most sweetly placed in Moorfields, since the dreadful fire in
London.I went to Windsor with my Lord Chamberlain (the castle
now repairing with exceeding cost) to see the rare work of Verrio, an
incomparable carving of Gibbons.Returned with my Lord by Hounslow Heath, where we saw
the newly raised army encamped, designed against France, in pretense, at
least; but which gave umbrage to the Parliament.His Majesty and a world
of company were in the field, and the whole army in battalia; a very
glorious sight.Now were brought into service a new sort of soldiers,
called GRENADIERS, who were dexterous in flinging hand grenades,
everyone having a pouch full; they had furred caps with coped crowns
like Janizaries, which made them look very fierce, and some had long
hoods hanging down behind, as we picture fools.Their clothing being
likewise piebald, yellow and red.Came to dine with me my Lord Longford, Treasurer of
Ireland, nephew to that learned gentleman, my Lord Aungier, with whom I
was long since acquainted; also the Lady Stidolph, and other company.The Earl of Ossory came to take his leave of me, going
into Holland to command the English forces.I went to the Tower to try a metal at the
Assay-master's, which only proved sulphur; then saw Monsieur Rotiere,
that excellent graver belonging to the Mint, who emulates even the
ancients, in both metal and stone;[38] he was now molding a horse for
the King's statue, to be cast in silver, of a yard high.[Footnote 38: Doubtless Philip Rotiere, who introduced the figure of
    Britannia into the coinage, taking for his model the King's
    favorite, Frances Stewart, Duchess of Richmond.]Elias Ashmole's library and curiosities,
at Lambeth.He had divers MSS., but most of them astrological, to which
study he is addicted, though I believe not learned, but very
industrious, as his History of the order of the Garter proves.He showed
me a toad included in amber.The prospect from a turret is very fine, it
being so near London, and yet not discovering any house about the
country.The famous John Tradescant bequeathed his Repository to this
gentleman, who has given them to the University of Oxford, and erected a
lecture on them, over the laboratory, in imitation of the Royal Society.Godolphin was made master of the robes to the King.There was sent me L70; from whom I knew not, to be by
me distributed among poor people; I afterward found it was from that
dear friend (Mrs.Godolphin), who had frequently given me large sums to
bestow on charities.I went to Lady Mordaunt, who put L100 into my hand to
dispose of for pious uses, relief of prisoners, poor, etc.Many a sum
had she sent me on similar occasions; a blessed creature she was, and
one that loved and feared God exemplarily.[Sidenote: WEYBRIDGE]

23d August, 1678.Upon Sir Robert Reading's importunity, I went to visit
the Duke of Norfolk, at his new palace at Weybridge, where he has laid
out in building near L10,000, on a copyhold, and in a miserable, barren,
sandy place by the street side; never in my life had I seen such expense
to so small purpose.The rooms are wainscotted, and some of them richly
pargeted with cedar, yew, cypress, etc.There are some good pictures,
especially that incomparable painting of Holbein's, where the Duke of
Norfolk, Charles Brandon and Henry VIII., are dancing with the three
ladies, with most amorous countenances, and sprightly motion exquisitely
expressed.It is a thousand pities (as I told my Lord of Arundel, his
son), that that jewel should be given away.Alban's house, at
Byfleet, an old, large building.Thence, to the papermills, where I
found them making a coarse white paper.They cull the rags which are
linen for white paper, woolen for brown; then they stamp them in troughs
to a pap, with pestles, or hammers, like the powder mills, then put it
into a vessel of water, in which they dip a frame closely wired with
wire as small as a hair and as close as a weaver's reed; on this they
take up the pap, the superfluous water draining through the wire; this
they dexterously turning, shake out like a pancake on a smooth board
between two pieces of flannel, then press it between a great press, the
flannel sucking out the moisture; then, taking it out, they ply and dry
it on strings, as they dry linen in the laundry; then dip it in alum
water, lastly, polish and make it up in quires.They put some gum in the
water in which they macerate the rags.The mark we find on the sheets is
formed in the wire.Sheldon (nephew to
the late Archbishop of Canterbury), and his pretty melancholy garden; I
took notice of the largest _arbor thuyris_ I had ever seen.The place is
finely watered, and there are many curiosities of India, shown in the
house.There was at Weybridge the Duchess of Norfolk, Lord Thomas Howard (a
worthy and virtuous gentleman, with whom my son was sometime bred in
Arundel House), who was newly come from Rome, where he had been some
time; also one of the Duke's daughters, by his first lady.My Lord
leading me about the house made no scruple of showing me all the hiding
places for the Popish priests, and where they said mass, for he was no
bigoted <DW7>.He told me he never trusted them with any secret, and
used Protestants only in all businesses of importance.I went this evening with my Lord Duke to Windsor, where was a
magnificent Court, it being the first time of his Majesty's removing
thither since it was repaired.I took leave of the Duke, and dined at Mr.Henry
Bruncker's, at the Abbey of Sheene, formerly a monastery of Carthusians,
there yet remaining one of their solitary cells with a cross.Within
this ample inclosure are several pretty villas and fine gardens of the
most excellent fruits, especially Sir William Temple's (lately
Ambassador into Holland), and the Lord Lisle's, son to the Earl of
Leicester, who has divers rare pictures, above all, that of Sir Brian
Tuke's, by Holbein.After dinner I walked to Ham, to see the house and garden of the Duke of
Lauderdale, which is indeed inferior to few of the best villas in Italy
itself; the house furnished like a great Prince's; the parterres,
flower-gardens, orangeries, groves, avenues, courts, statues,
perspectives, fountains, aviaries, and all this at the banks of the
sweetest river in the world, must needs be admirable.Hence, I went to my worthy friend, Sir Henry Capel [at Kew], brother to
the Earl of Essex; it is an old timber-house; but his garden has the
choicest fruit of any plantation in England, as he is the most
industrious and understanding in it.I was called to London to wait upon the Duke of
Norfolk, who having at my sole request bestowed the Arundelian Library
on the Royal Society; sent to me to take charge of the books, and remove
them, only stipulating that I would suffer the Herald's chief officer,
Sir William Dugdale, to have such of them as concerned heraldry and the
marshal's office, books of armory and genealogies, the Duke being Earl
Marshal of England.I procured for our Society, besides printed books,
near one hundred MSS.The printed
books being of the oldest impressions, are not the less valuable; I
esteem them almost equal to MSS.Among them, are most of the Fathers,
printed at Basil, before the Jesuits abused them with their expurgatory
Indexes; there is a noble MS.Many of these books had been
presented by Popes, Cardinals, and great persons, to the Earls of
Arundel and Dukes of Norfolk; and the late magnificent Earl of Arundel
bought a noble library in Germany, which is in this collection.I should
not, for the honor I bear the family, have persuaded the Duke to part
with these, had I not seen how negligent he was of them, suffering the
priests and everybody to carry away and dispose of what they pleased; so
that abundance of rare things are irrecoverably gone.Having taken order here, I went to the Royal Society to give them an
account of what I had procured, that they might call a Council and
appoint a day to wait on the Duke to thank him for this munificent gift.[Sidenote: LONDON]

3d September, 1678.I went to London, to dine with Mrs.Godolphin, and
found her in labor; she was brought to bed of a son, who was baptized in
the chamber, by the name of Francis, the susceptors being Sir William
Godolphin (head of the family), Mr.John Hervey, Treasurer to the Queen,
and Mrs.Boscawen, sister to Sir William and the father.While I was at church came a letter from Mr.Godolphin, that my dear friend his lady was exceedingly ill, and
desiring my prayers and assistance.My wife and I took boat immediately,
and went to Whitehall, where, to my inexpressible sorrow, I found she
had been attacked with a new fever, then reigning this excessive hot
autumn, and which was so violent, that it was not thought she could last
many hours.She died in the 26th year of her age, to the
inexpressible affliction of her dear husband, and all her relations, but
of none in the world more than of myself, who lost the most excellent
and inestimable friend that ever lived.Never was a more virtuous and
inviolable friendship; never a more religious, discreet, and admirable
creature, beloved of all, admired of all, for all possible perfections
of her sex.She is gone to receive the reward of her signal charity, and
all other her Christian graces, too blessed a creature to converse with
mortals, fitted as she was, by a most holy life, to be received into the
mansions above.She was for wit, beauty, good nature, fidelity,
discretion, and all accomplishments, the most incomparable person.How
shall I ever repay the obligations to her for the infinite good offices
she did my soul by so often engaging me to make religion the terms and
tie of the friendship there was between us!She was the best wife, the
best mistress, the best friend, that ever husband had.But it is not
here that I pretend to give her character, HAVING DESIGNED TO CONSECRATE
HER WORTHY LIFE TO POSTERITY.Her husband, struck with unspeakable affliction, fell down as dead.The
King himself, and all the Court, expressed their sorrow.To the poor and
miserable, her loss was irreparable; for there was no degree but had
some obligation to her memory.So careful and provident was she to be
prepared for all possible accidents, that (as if she foresaw her end)
she received the heavenly viaticum but the Sunday before, after a most
solemn recollection.She put all her domestic concerns into the exactest
order, and left a letter directed to her husband, to be opened in case
she died in childbed, in which with the most pathetic and endearing
expressions of the most loyal and virtuous wife, she begs his kindness
to her memory might be continued by his care and esteem of those she
left behind, even to her domestic servants, to the meanest of which she
left considerable legacies, as well as to the poor.It was now seven
years since she was maid of honor to the Queen, that she regarded me as
a father, a brother, and what is more, a friend.We often prayed,
visited the sick and miserable, received, read, discoursed, and
communicated in all holy offices together.She was most dear to my wife,
and affectionate to my children.This only is my
comfort, that she is happy in Christ, and I shall shortly behold her
again.She desired to be buried in the dormitory of his family, near
three hundred miles from all her other friends.So afflicted was her
husband at this severe loss, that the entire care of her funeral was
committed to me.Having closed the eyes, and dropped a tear upon the
cheek of my dear departed friend, lovely even in death, I caused her
corpse to be embalmed and wrapped in lead, a plate of brass soldered
thereon, with an inscription, and other circumstances due to her worth,
with as much diligence and care as my grieved heart would permit me; I
then retired home for two days, which were spent in solitude and sad
reflection.She was, accordingly, carried to Godolphin, in
Cornwall, in a hearse with six horses, attended by two coaches of as
many, with about thirty of her relations and servants.There accompanied
the hearse her husband's brother, Sir William, two more of his brothers,
and three sisters; her husband was so overcome with grief, that he was
wholly unfit to travel so long a journey, till he was more composed.I
went as far as Hounslow with a sad heart; but was obliged to return upon
some indispensable affairs.The corpse was ordered to be taken out of
the hearse every night, and decently placed in the house, with tapers
about it, and her servants attending, to Cornwall; and then was
honorably interred in the parish church of Godolphin.This funeral cost
not much less than L1,000.Godolphin, I looked over and sorted his lady's papers, most of
which consisted of Prayers, Meditations, Sermon-notes, Discourses, and
Collections on several religious subjects, and many of her own happy
composing, and so pertinently digested, as if she had been all her life
a student in divinity.We found a diary of her solemn resolutions,
tending to practical virtue, with letters from select friends, all put
into exact method.It astonished us to see what she had read and
written, her youth considered.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st October, 1678.The Parliament and the whole Nation were alarmed
about a conspiracy of some eminent <DW7>s for the destruction of the
King and introduction of Popery, discovered by one Oates and Dr.Tongue,[39] WHICH LAST I KNEW, BEING THE TRANSLATOR OF THE "Jesuits'
Morals"; I went to see and converse with him at Whitehall, with Mr.Oates, one that was lately an apostate to the church of Rome, and now
returned again with this discovery.He seemed to be a bold man, and, in
my thoughts, furiously indiscreet; but everybody believed what he said;
and it quite changed the genius and motions of the Parliament, growing
now corrupt and interested with long sitting and court practices; but,
with all this, Popery would not go down.This discovery turned them all
as one man against it, and nothing was done but to find out the depth of
this.Oates was encouraged, and everything he affirmed taken for gospel;
the truth is, the Roman Catholics were exceedingly bold and busy
everywhere, since the Duke forbore to go any longer to the chapel.[Footnote 39: Ezrael Tonge was bred in University College, Oxford,
    and being puritanically inclined, quitted the University; but in
    1648 returned, and was made a Fellow.He had the living of Pluckley,
    in Kent, which he resigned in consequence of quarrels with his
    parishioners and Quakers.In 1657, he was made fellow of the
    newly-erected College at Durham, and that being dissolved in 1660,
    he taught school at Islington.He then went with Colonel Edward
    Harley to Dunkirk, and subsequently took a small living in
    Herefordshire (Lentwardine); but quitted it for St.Mary Stayning,
    in London, which, after the fire in 1666, was united to St.These he held till his death, in 1680.He was a great
    opponent of the Roman Catholics.Wood mentions several publications
    of his, among which are, "The Jesuits Unmasked," 1678; "Jesuitical
    Aphorisms," 1678; and "The Jesuits' Morals," 1680 (1670); the two
    latter translated from the French.(Wood's "_Athenae, Oxon._" vol.Evelyn speaks of the last of these translations as
    having been executed by his desire: and it figures in a notable
    passage of Oates's testimony.Oates said, for example, "that Thomas
    Whitbread, a priest, on 13th of June, 16.did tell the rector of
    St.Omer's that a Minister of the Church of England had scandalously
    put out the 'Jesuits' Morals' in English, and had endeavored to
    render them odious, and had asked the Rector whether he thought
    Oates might know him?and the Rector called, the deponent, who heard
    these words as he stood at the chamber door, and when he went into
    the chamber of the Provincial, he asked him 'If he knew the author
    of the "Jesuits' Morals?"'deponent answered, 'His person, but not
    his name.'Whitbread then demanded, whether he would undertake to
    poison, or assassinate the author; which deponent undertook, having
    L50 reward promised him, and appointed to return to England."]Godolphin requested me to continue the trust his
wife had reposed in me, in behalf of his little son, conjuring me to
transfer the friendship I had for his dear wife, on him and his.The murder of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, found
strangled about this time, as was manifest, by the <DW7>s, he being the
Justice of the Peace, and one who knew much of their practices, as
conversant with Coleman (a servant of the... now accused), put the
whole nation into a new ferment against them.Being the 58th of my age, required my humble
addresses to Almighty God, and that he would take off his heavy hand,
still on my family; and restore comforts to us after the death of my
excellent friend.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1678.Tillotson preached before the Commons at St.He said the <DW7>s were now arrived at that impudence, as
to deny that there ever was any such as the gunpowder-conspiracy; but he
affirmed that he himself had several letters written by Sir Everard
Digby (one of the traitors), in which he gloried that he was to suffer
for it; and that it was so contrived, that of the <DW7>s not above two
or three should have been blown up, and they, such as were not worth
saving.I never saw the Court more
brave, nor the nation in more apprehension and consternation.Coleman
and one Staly had now been tried, condemned, and executed.On this,
Oates grew so presumptuous as to accuse the Queen of intending to poison
the King; which certainly that pious and virtuous lady abhorred the
thoughts of, and Oates's circumstances made it utterly unlikely in my
opinion.He probably thought to gratify some who would have been glad
his Majesty should have married a fruitful lady; but the King was too
kind a husband to let any of these make impression on him.However,
divers of the Popish peers were sent to the Tower, accused by Oates; and
all the Roman Catholic lords were by a new Act forever excluded the
Parliament; which was a mighty blow.The King's, Queen's, and Duke's
servants, were banished, and a test to be taken by everybody who
pretended to enjoy any office of public trust, and who would not be
suspected of Popery.I went with Sir William Godolphin, a member of the
Commons' House, to the Bishop of Ely (Dr.Peter Gunning), to be resolved
whether masses were idolatry, as the text expressed it, which was so
worded, that several good Protestants scrupled, and Sir William, though
a learned man and excellent divine himself, had some doubts about it.The Bishop's opinion was that he might take it, though he wished it had
been otherwise worded in the text.I went with my Lady Sunderland to Chelsa, and
dined with the Countess of Bristol [her mother] in the great house,
formerly the Duke of Buckingham's, a spacious and excellent place for
the extent of ground and situation in a good air.The house is large but
ill-contrived, though my Lord of Bristol, who purchased it after he sold
Wimbledon to my Lord Treasurer, expended much money on it.There were
divers pictures of Titian and Vandyke, and some of Bassano, very
excellent, especially an Adonis and Venus, a Duke of Venice, a butcher
in his shambles selling meat to a Swiss; and of Vandyke, my Lord of
Bristol's picture, with the Earl of Bedford's at length, in the same
table.There was in the garden a rare collection of orange trees, of
which she was pleased to bestow some upon me.Houblon's, a French merchant, who had his house furnished _en Prince_,
and gave us a splendid entertainment.The Long Parliament, which had sat ever since the
Restoration, was dissolved by persuasion of the Lord Treasurer, though
divers of them were believed to be his pensioner.At this, all the
politicians were at a stand, they being very eager in pursuit of the
late plot of the <DW7>s.Cudworth preached before the King at Whitehall,
on 2 Timothy iii.5, reckoning up the perils of the last times, in
which, among other wickedness, treasons should be one of the greatest,
applying it to the occasion, as committed under a form of reformation
and godliness; concluding that the prophecy did intend more particularly
the present age, as one of the last times; the sins there enumerated,
more abundantly reigning than ever.[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d February, 1679.Durell, Dean of Windsor, preached to the
household at Whitehall, on 1 Cor.22; he read the whole sermon out
of his notes, which I had never before seen a Frenchman do, he being of
Jersey, and bred at Paris.Pierce, Dean of Salisbury, preached on 1 John,
iv.1, "Try the Spirits, there being so many delusory ones gone forth of
late into the world"; he inveighed against the pernicious doctrines of
Mr.My brother Evelyn, was now chosen Knight for the County of Surrey,
carrying it against my Lord Longford and Sir Adam Brown, of Bechworth
Castle.The country coming in to give him their suffrages were so many,
that I believe they ate and drank him out near L2,000, by a most
abominable custom.Godolphin, was now made one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury, and of the Privy Council.The Bishop of Gloucester preached in a manner very like
Bishop Andrews, full of divisions, and scholastical, and that with much
quickness.Our vicar preached exceedingly well on 1
Cor.The Holy Communion followed, at which I and my daughter, Mary
(now about fourteen years old), received for the first time.The Lord
Jesus continue his grace unto her, and improve this blessed beginning!The Duke of York, voted against by the Commons for his
recusancy, went over to Flanders; which made much discourse.Pepys in the Tower, he having been
committed by the House of Commons for misdemeanors in the Admiralty when
he was secretary; I believe he was unjustly charged.Here I saluted my
Lords Stafford and Petre, who were committed for the Popish plot.I saw the magnificent cavalcade and entry of the
Portugal Ambassador.I was godfather to a son of Sir Christopher Wren,
surveyor of his Majesty's buildings, that most excellent and learned
person, with Sir William Fermor, and my Lady Viscountess Newport, wife
of the Treasurer of the Household.Thence to Chelsea, to Sir Stephen Fox, and my lady, in order to the
purchase of the Countess of Bristol's house there, which she desired me
to procure a chapman for.I dined at Sir Robert Clayton's with Sir Robert Viner,
the great banker.There were now divers Jesuits executed about the plot,
and a rebellion in Scotland of the fanatics, so that there was a sad
prospect of public affairs.The new Commissioners of the Admiralty came to visit
me, viz, Sir Henry Capell, brother to the Earl of Essex, Mr.Finch,
eldest son to the Lord Chancellor, Sir Humphry Winch, Sir Thomas Meeres,
Mr.Hales, with some of the Commissioners of the Navy.I dined at Sir William Godolphin's, and with that
learned gentleman went to take the air in Hyde Park, where was a
glorious _cortege_.Sending a piece of venison to Mr.Pepys, still a
prisoner, I went and dined with him.Now were there papers, speeches, and libels, publicly
cried in the streets against the Dukes of York and Lauderdale, etc.,
obnoxious to the Parliament, with too much and indeed too shameful a
liberty; but the people and Parliament had gotten head by reason of the
vices of the great ones.[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was now brought up to London a child, son of one Mr.Wotton,
formerly amanuensis to Dr.Andrews, Bishop of Winton, who both read and
perfectly understood Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Arabic, Syriac, and most of
the modern languages; disputed in divinity, law, and all the sciences;
was skillful in history, both ecclesiastical and profane; in politics;
in a word, so universally and solidly learned at eleven years of age,
that he was looked on as a miracle.Lloyd, one of the most deeply
learned divines of this nation in all sorts of literature, with Dr.Burnet, who had severely examined him, came away astonished, and they
told me they did not believe there had the like appeared in the world.He had only been instructed by his father, who being himself a learned
person, confessed that his son knew all that he himself knew.But, what
was more admirable than his vast memory, was his judgment and invention,
he being tried with divers hard questions, which required maturity of
thought and experience.He was also dexterous in chronology,
antiquities, mathematics.In sum, an _intellectus universalis_, beyond
all that we read of Picus Mirandula, and other precocious wits, and yet
withal a very humble child.I went to see how things stood at Parson's Green, my
Lady Viscountess Mordaunt (now sick in Paris, whither she went for
health) having made me a trustee for her children, an office I could not
refuse to this most excellent, pious, and virtuous lady, my long
acquaintance.Sidney Godolphin, now one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury.I went early to the Old Bailey Sessions House, to the
famous trial of Sir George Wakeman, one of the Queen's physicians, and
three Benedictine monks; the first (whom I was well acquainted with, and
take to be a worthy gentleman abhorring such a fact), for intending to
poison the King; the others as accomplices to carry on the plot, to
subvert the government, and introduce Popery.The bench was crowded with
the judges, Lord Mayor justices, and innumerable spectators.Oates (as he called himself), and one Bedlow, a man of
inferior note.Their testimonies were not so pregnant, and I fear much
of it from hearsay, but swearing positively to some particulars, which
drew suspicion upon their truth; nor did circumstances so agree, as to
give either the bench or jury so entire satisfaction as was expected.After, therefore, a long and tedious trial of nine hours, the jury
brought them in not guilty, to the extraordinary triumph of the <DW7>s,
and without sufficient disadvantage and reflections on witnesses,
especially Oates and Bedlow.This was a happy day for the lords in the Tower, who, expecting their
trial, had this gone against the prisoners at the bar, would all have
been in the utmost hazard.For my part, I look on Oates as a vain,
insolent man, puffed up with the favor of the Commons for having
discovered something really true, more especially as detecting the
dangerous intrigue of Coleman, proved out of his own letters, and of a
general design which the Jesuited party of the <DW7>s ever had and
still have, to ruin the Church of England; but that he was trusted with
those great secrets he pretended, or had any solid ground for what he
accused divers noblemen of, I have many reasons to induce my contrary
belief.That among so many commissions as he affirmed to have delivered
to them from P. Oliva[40] and the Pope,--he who made no scruple of
opening all other papers, letters, and secrets, should not only not open
any of those pretended commissions, but not so much as take any copy or
witness of any one of them, is almost miraculous.But the Commons (some
leading persons I mean of them) had so exalted him that they took all he
said for Gospel, and without more ado ruined all whom he named to be
conspirators; nor did he spare whoever came in his way.But, indeed, the
murder of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, suspected to have been compassed by
the Jesuits' party for his intimacy with Coleman (a busy person whom I
also knew), and the fear they had that he was able to have discovered
things to their prejudice, did so exasperate not only the Commons, but
all the nation, that much of these sharpnesses against the more honest
Roman Catholics who lived peaceably, is to be imputed to that horrid
fact.[Footnote 40: Padre Oliva, General of the Order of Jesuits.]The sessions ended, I dined or rather supped (so late it was) with the
judges in the large room annexed to the place, and so returned home.Though it was not my custom or delight to be often present at any
capital trials, we having them commonly so exactly published by those
who take them in short-hand, yet I was inclined to be at this signal
one, that by the ocular view of the carriages and other circumstances of
the managers and parties concerned, I might inform myself, and regulate
my opinion of a cause that had so alarmed the whole nation.Dined at Clapham, at Sir D. Gauden's; went thence with
him to Windsor, to assist him in a business with his Majesty.I lay that
night at Eton College, the Provost's lodgings (Dr.Craddock), where I
was courteously entertained.[Sidenote: LONDON]

23d July, 1679.To Court: after dinner, I visited that excellent
painter, Verrio, whose works in _fresco_ in the King's palace, at
Windsor, will celebrate his name as long as those walls last.He showed
us his pretty garden, choice flowers, and curiosities, he himself being
a skillful gardener.I went to Clifden, that stupendous natural rock, wood, and prospect, of
the Duke of Buckingham's, and buildings of extraordinary expense.The
grots in the chalky rocks are pretty: it is a romantic object, and the
place altogether answers the most poetical description that can be made
of solitude, precipice, prospect, or whatever can contribute to a thing
so very like their imaginations.The stand, somewhat like Frascati as to
its front, and on the platform is a circular view to the utmost verge of
the horizon, which, with the serpenting of the Thames, is admirable.The
staircase is for its materials singular; the cloisters, descents,
gardens, and avenue through the wood, august and stately; but the land
all about wretchedly barren, and producing nothing but fern.Indeed, as
I told his Majesty that evening (asking me how I liked Clifden) without
flattery, that it did not please me so well as Windsor for the prospect
and park, which is without compare; there being but one only opening,
and that narrow, which led one to any variety; whereas that of Windsor
is everywhere great and unconfined.Returning, I called at my cousin Evelyn's, who has a very pretty seat in
the forest, two miles by hither Clifden, on a flat, with gardens
exquisitely kept, though large, and the house a staunch good old
building, and what was singular, some of the rooms floored dove
tail-wise without a nail, exactly close.One of the closets is pargeted
with plain deal, set in diamond, exceeding staunch and pretty.Dined at the Sheriff's, when, the Company of Drapers
and their wives being invited, there was a sumptuous entertainment,
according to the forms of the city, with music, etc., comparable to any
prince's service in Europe.I went this morning to show my Lord Chamberlain, his
Lady, and the Duchess of Grafton, the incomparable work of Mr.Gibbon,
the carver, whom I first recommended to his Majesty, his house being
furnished like a cabinet, not only with his own work, but divers
excellent paintings of the best hands.Thence, to Sir Stephen Fox's,
where we spent the day.After evening service, to see a neighbor, one Mr.Bohun, related to my son's late tutor of that name, a rich Spanish
merchant, living in a neat place, which he has adorned with many
curiosities, especially several carvings of Mr.Gibbons, and some
pictures by Streeter.To Windsor, to congratulate his Majesty on his
recovery; I kissed the Duke's hand, now lately returned from
Flanders[41] to visit his brother the King, on which there were various
bold and foolish discourses, the Duke of Monmouth being sent away.[Footnote 41: He returned the day before, the 12th of September.This is another of the indications that the entries of this Diary
    were not always made on the precise days they refer to.]My Lord Sunderland, one of the principal
Secretaries of State, invited me to dinner, where was the King's natural
son, the Earl of Plymouth, the Earl of Shrewsbury, Earl of Essex, Earl
of Mulgrave, Mr.After dinner I went to prayers
at Eton, and visited Mr.Henry Godolphin, fellow there, and Dr.Slingsby and Signor Verrio came to dine with
me, to whom I gave China oranges off my own trees, as good, I think, as
were ever eaten.Dined at my Lord Chamberlain's, the King being now
newly returned from his Newmarket recreations.Dined at the Lord Mayor's; and, in the evening, went
to the funeral of my pious, dear, and ancient learned friend, Dr.Jasper
Needham, who was buried at St.He was a true and holy
Christian, and one who loved me with great affection.Dove preached
with an eulogy due to his memory.I lost in this person one of my
dearest remaining sincere friends.I was invited to dine at my Lord Teviotdale's, a
Scotch Earl, a learned and knowing nobleman.Montague's new palace near Bloomsbury, built by our curator, Mr.Hooke, somewhat after the French; it was most nobly furnished, and a
fine, but too much exposed garden.[42]

6th November, 1679.Dined at the Countess of Sunderland's, and was this
evening at the remarriage of the Duchess of Grafton to the Duke (his
Majesty's natural son), she being now twelve years old.The ceremony was
performed in my Lord Chamberlain's (her father's) lodgings at Whitehall
by the Bishop of Rochester, his Majesty being present.A sudden and
unexpected thing, when everybody believed the first marriage would have
come to nothing; but, the measure being determined, I was privately
invited by my Lady, her mother, to be present.I confess I could give
her little joy, and so I plainly told her, but she said the King would
have it so, and there was no going back.This sweetest, most hopeful,
most beautiful, child, and most virtuous, too, was sacrificed to a boy
that had been rudely bred, without anything to encourage them but his
Majesty's pleasure.I pray God the sweet child find it to her advantage,
who, if my augury deceive me not, will in a few years be such a paragon
as were fit to make the wife of the greatest Prince in Europe!I staid
supper, where his Majesty sat between the Duchess of Cleveland (the
mother of the Duke of Grafton) and the sweet Duchess the bride; there
were several great persons and ladies, without pomp.My love to my Lord
Arlington's family, and the sweet child made me behold all this with
regret, though as the Duke of Grafton affects the sea, to which I find
his father intends to use him, he may emerge a plain, useful and robust
officer: and were he polished, a tolerable person; for he is exceedingly
handsome, by far surpassing any of the King's other natural issue.At Sir Stephen Fox's, and was agreeing for the
Countess of Bristol's house at Chelsea, within L500.I dined at my Lord Mayor's, being desired by the
Countess of Sunderland to carry her thither on a solemn day, that she
might see the pomp and ceremony of this Prince of Citizens, there never
having been any, who for the stateliness of his palace, prodigious
feasting, and magnificence, exceeded him.This Lord Mayor's acquaintance
had been from the time of his being apprentice to one Mr.Abbot, his
uncle, who being a scrivener, and an honest worthy man, one who was
condemned to die at the beginning of the troubles forty years past, as
concerned in the commission of array for King Charles I. had escaped
with his life; I often used his assistance in money matters.Robert
Clayton, then a boy, his nephew, became, after his uncle Abbot's death,
so prodigiously rich and opulent, that he was reckoned one of the
wealthiest citizens.He married a free-hearted woman, who became his
hospitable disposition; and having no children, with the accession of
his partner and fellow apprentice, who also left him his estate, he grew
excessively rich.He was a discreet magistrate, and though envied, I
think without much cause.Some believed him guilty of hard dealing,
especially with the Duke of Buckingham, much of whose estate he had
swallowed, but I never saw any ill by him, considering the trade he was
of.The reputation and known integrity of his uncle, Abbot, brought all
the royal party to him, by which he got not only great credit, but vast
wealth, so as he passed this office with infinite magnificence and
honor.Slingsby, Master of the Mint, with
my wife, invited to hear music, which was exquisitely performed by four
of the most renowned masters: Du Prue, a Frenchman, on the lute; Signor
Bartholomeo, an Italian, on the harpsichord; Nicholao on the violin;
but, above all, for its sweetness and novelty, the _viol d'amore_ of
five wire strings played on with a bow, being but an ordinary violin,
played on lyre-way, by a German.There was also a _flute douce_, now in
much request for accompanying the voice.Slingsby, whose son and
daughter played skillfully, had these meetings frequently in his house.I dined at my Lord Mayor's, to accompany my
worthiest and generous friend, the Earl of Ossory; it was on a Friday, a
private day, but the feast and entertainment might have become a King.Such an hospitable costume and splendid magistrature does no city in the
world show, as I believe.Allestree preached before the household on St.20, before the King, showing with
how little reason the <DW7>s applied those words of our blessed Savior
to maintain the pretended infallibility they boast of.I never heard a
more Christian and excellent discourse; yet were some offended that he
seemed to say the Church of Rome was a true church; but it was a
captious mistake; for he never affirmed anything that could be more to
their reproach, and that such was the present Church of Rome, showing
how much it had erred.There was not in this sermon so much as a shadow
for censure, no person of all the clergy having testified greater zeal
against the errors of the <DW7>s than this pious and most learned
person.I dined at the Bishop of Rochester's, and then went to St.Paul's to hear that great wit, Dr.His talent was a great memory,
never making use of notes, a readiness of expression in a most pure and
plain style of words, full of matter, easily delivered.I met the Earl of Clarendon with the rest of my
fellow executors of the Will of my late Lady Viscountess Mordaunt,
namely, Mr.Laurence Hyde, one of the Commissioners of the Treasury, and
lately Plenipotentiary-Ambassador at Nimeguen; Andrew Newport; and Sir
Charles Wheeler; to examine and audit and dispose of this year's account
of the estate of this excellent Lady, according to the direction of her
Will.I went to see Sir John Stonehouse, with whom I was
treating a marriage between my son and his daughter-in-law.Came over the Duke of Monmouth from Holland
unexpectedly to his Majesty; while the Duke of York was on his journey
to Scotland, whither the King sent him to reside and govern.The bells
and bonfires of the city at this arrival of the Duke of Monmouth
publishing their joy, to the no small regret of some at Court.This
Duke, whom for distinction they called the Protestant Duke (though the
son of an abandoned woman), the people made their idol.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th December, 1679.I dined, together with Lord Ossory and the Earl of
Chesterfield, at the Portugal Ambassador's, now newly come, at Cleveland
House, a noble palace, too good for that infamous.... The staircase is
sumptuous, and the gallery and garden; but, above all, the costly
furniture belonging to the Ambassador, especially the rich Japan
cabinets, of which I think there were a dozen.There was a billiard
table, with as many more hazards as ours commonly have; the game being
only to prosecute the ball till hazarded, without passing the port, or
touching the pin; if one miss hitting the ball every time, the game is
lost, or if hazarded.It is more difficult to hazard a ball, though so
many, than in our table, by reason the bound is made so exactly even,
and the edges not stuffed; the balls are also bigger, and they for the
most part use the sharp and small end of the billiard stick, which is
shod with brass, or silver.The entertainment was exceedingly civil;
but, besides a good olio, the dishes were trifling, hashed and condited
after their way, not at all fit for an English stomach, which is for
solid meat.There was yet good fowls, but roasted to coal, nor were the
sweetmeats good.I went to meet Sir John Stonehouse, and give him a
particular of the settlement on my son, who now made his addresses to
the young lady his daughter-in-law, daughter of Lady Stonehouse.Cave, author of "Primitive Christianity,"
etc., a pious and learned man, preached at Whitehall to the household,
on James iii.17, concerning the duty of grace and charity.I supped with Sir Stephen Fox, now made one of the
Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.The writings for the settling jointure and other
contracts of marriage of my son were finished and sealed.The lady was
to bring L5,000, in consideration of a settlement of L500 a year present
maintenance, which was likewise to be her jointure, and L500 a year
after mine and my wife's decease.But, with God's blessing, it will be
at the least L1,000 a year more in a few years.I pray God make him
worthy of it, and a comfort to his excellent mother, who deserves much
from him!Martha
Spencer, daughter to my Lady Stonehouse by a former gentleman, at St.Andrew's, Holborn, by our Vicar, borrowing the church of Dr.We afterward
dined at a house in Holborn; and, after the solemnity and dancing was
done, they were bedded at Sir John Stonehouse's lodgings in Bow Street,
Convent Garden.To the Royal Society, where I met an Irish Bishop
with his Lady, who was daughter to my worthy and pious friend, Dr.Jeremy Taylor, late Bishop of Down and Connor; they came to see the
Repository.She seemed to be a knowing woman, beyond the ordinary talent
of her sex.I dined at my Lord Mayor's, in order to the meeting of
my Lady Beckford, whose daughter (a rich heiress) I had recommended to
my brother of Wotton for his only son, she being the daughter of the
lady by Mr.To London, to receive L3,000 of my daughter-in-law's
portion, which was paid in gold.The Dean of Sarum preached on Jerem.5, an hour
and a half from his common-place book, of kings and great men retiring
to private situations.[Sidenote: CASHIOBURY]

18th April, 1680.On the earnest invitation of the Earl of Essex, I went
with him to his house at Cashiobury, in Hertfordshire.It was on Sunday,
but going early from his house in the square of St.James, we arrived by
ten o'clock; this he thought too late to go to church, and we had
prayers in his chapel.The house is new, a plain fabric, built by my
friend, Mr.There are divers fair and good rooms, and
excellent carving by Gibbons, especially the chimney-piece of the
library.There is in the porch, or entrance, a painting by Verrio, of
Apollo and the Liberal Arts.One room pargeted with yew, which I liked
well.Some of the chimney mantels are of Irish marble, brought by my
Lord from Ireland, when he was Lord-Lieutenant, and not much inferior to
Italian.The tympanum, or gable, at the front is a bass-relievo of Diana
hunting, cut in Portland stone, handsomely enough.I do not approve of
the middle doors being round: but, when the hall is finished as
designed, it being an oval with a cupola, together with the other wing,
it will be a very noble palace.The library is large, and very nobly
furnished, and all the books are richly bound and gilded; but there are
no MSS., except the Parliament Rolls and Journals, the transcribing and
binding of which cost him, as he assured me, L500.No man has been more industrious than this noble Lord in planting about
his seat, adorned with walks, ponds, and other rural elegancies; but the
soil is stony, churlish, and uneven, nor is the water near enough to the
house, though a very swift and clear stream runs within a flight-shot
from it in the valley, which may fitly be called Coldbrook, it being
indeed excessively cold, yet producing fair trouts.It is a pity the
house was not situated to more advantage: but it seems it was built just
where the old one was, which I believe he only meant to repair; this
leads men into irremediable errors, and saves but a little.The land about is exceedingly addicted to wood, but the coldness of the
place hinders the growth.Black cherry trees prosper even to
considerable timber, some being eighty feet long; they make also very
handsome avenues.There is a pretty oval at the end of a fair walk, set
about with treble rows of Spanish chestnut trees.The gardens are very rare, and cannot be otherwise, having so skillful
an artist to govern them as Mr.Cooke, who is, as to the mechanic part,
not ignorant in mathematics, and pretends to astrology.There is an
excellent collection of the choicest fruit.As for my Lord, he is a sober, wise, judicious, and pondering person,
not illiterate beyond the rate of most noblemen in this age, very well
versed in English history and affairs, industrious, frugal, methodical,
and every way accomplished.His Lady (being sister of the late Earl of
Northumberland) is a wise, yet somewhat melancholy woman, setting her
heart too much on the little lady, her daughter, of whom she is over
fond.My Lord was not long since come from his Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland,
where he showed his abilities in administration and government, as well
as prudence in considerably augmenting his estate without reproach.He
had been Ambassador-extraordinary in Denmark, and, in a word, such a
person as became the son of that worthy hero his father to be, the late
Lord Capel, who lost his life for King Charles I.

We spent our time in the mornings in walking, or riding, and contriving
[alterations], and the afternoons in the library, so as I passed my time
for three or four days with much satisfaction.He was pleased in
conversation to impart to me divers particulars of state, relating to
the present times.He being no great friend to the D---- was now laid
aside, his integrity and abilities being not so suitable in this
conjuncture.To a meeting of the executors of late Viscountess
Mordaunt's estate, to consider of the sale of Parson's Green, being in
treaty with Mr.Loftus, and to settle the half year's account.Was a meeting of the feoffees of the poor of our parish.This year I would stand one of the collectors of their rents, to give
example to others.My son was added to the feoffees.This afternoon came to visit me Sir Edward Deering, of Surrendon, in
Kent, one of the Lords of the Treasury, with his daughter, married to my
worthy friend, Sir Robert Southwell, Clerk of the Council, now
Extraordinary-Envoy to the Duke of Brandenburgh, and other Princes in
Germany, as before he had been in Portugal, being a sober, wise, and
virtuous gentleman.Shish, master-shipwright
of his Majesty's Yard here, an honest and remarkable man, and his death
a public loss, for his excellent success in building ships (though
altogether illiterate), and for breeding up so many of his children to
be able artists.I held up the pall with three knights, who did him that
honor, and he was worthy of it.It was the custom of this good man to
rise in the night, and to pray, kneeling in his own coffin, which he had
lying by him for many years.He was born that famous year, the
Gunpowder-plot, 1605.Came to dine with us the Countess of Clarendon, Dr.Lloyd, Dean of Bangor (since Bishop of St.Burnet, author of
the "History of the Reformation," and my old friend, Mr.After
dinner we all went to see the Observatory, and Mr.Flamsted, who showed
us divers rare instruments, especially the great quadrant.[Sidenote: WINDSOR]

24th July, 1680.Went with my wife and daughter to Windsor, to see that
stately court, now near finished.There was erected in the court the
King on horseback, lately cast in copper, and set on a rich pedestal of
white marble, the work of Mr.Gibbons, at the expense of Toby Rustate, a
page of the back stairs, who by his wonderful frugality had arrived to a
great estate in money, and did many works of charity, as well as this of
gratitude to his master, which cost him L1,000.He is very simple,
ignorant, but honest and loyal creature.We all dined at the Countess of Sunderland's, afterward to see Signor
Verrio's garden, thence to Eton College, to salute the provost, and
heard a Latin speech of one of the alumni (it being at the election) and
were invited to supper; but took our leave, and got to London that night
in good time.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th July, 1680.My most noble and illustrious friend, the Earl of
Ossory, espying me this morning after sermon in the privy gallery,
calling to me, told me he was now going his journey (meaning to Tangier,
whither he was designed Governor, and General of the forces, to regain
the losses we had lately sustained from the Moors, when Inchiquin was
Governor).I asked if he would not call at my house (as he always did
whenever he went out of England on any exploit).He said he must embark
at Portsmouth, "wherefore let you and me dine together to-day; I am
quite alone, and have something to impart to you; I am not well, shall
be private, and desire your company."Being retired to his lodgings, and set down on a couch, he sent to his
secretary for the copy of a letter which he had written to Lord
Sunderland (Secretary of State), wishing me to read it; it was to take
notice how ill he resented it, that he should tell the King before Lord
Ossory's face, that Tangier was not to be kept, but would certainly be
lost, and yet added that it was fit Lord Ossory should be sent, that
they might give some account of it to the world, meaning (as supposed)
the next Parliament, when all such miscarriages would probably be
examined; this Lord Ossory took very ill of Lord Sunderland, and not
kindly of the King, who resolving to send him with an incompetent force,
seemed, as his Lordship took it, to be willing to cast him away, not
only on a hazardous adventure, but in most men's opinion, an
impossibility, seeing there was not to be above 300 or 400 horse, and
4,000 foot for the garrison and all, both to defend the town, form a
camp, repulse the enemy, and fortify what ground they should get in.This touched my Lord deeply, that he should be so little considered as
to put him on a business in which he should probably not only lose his
reputation, but be charged with all the miscarriage and ill success;
whereas, at first they promised 6,000 foot and 600 horse effective.My Lord, being an exceedingly brave and valiant person, and who had so
approved himself in divers signal battles, both at sea and land; so
beloved and so esteemed by the people, as one they depended on, upon all
occasions worthy of such a captain;--he looked on this as too great an
indifference in his Majesty, after all his services, and the merits of
his father, the Duke of Ormond, and a design of some who envied his
virtue.It certainly took so deep root in his mind, that he who was the
most void of fear in the world (and assured me he would go to Tangier
with ten men if his Majesty commanded him) could not bear up against
this unkindness.Having disburdened himself of this to me after dinner,
he went with his Majesty to the sheriffs at a great supper in
Fishmongers' Hall; but finding himself ill, took his leave immediately
of his Majesty, and came back to his lodging.Not resting well this
night, he was persuaded to remove to Arlington House, for better
accommodation.His disorder turned to a malignant fever, which
increasing, after all that six of the most able physicians could do, he
became delirious, with intervals of sense, during which Dr.Lloyd (after
Bishop of St.Asaph) administered the Holy Sacrament, of which I also
participated.He died the Friday following, the 30th of July, to the
universal grief of all that knew or heard of his great worth, nor had
any a greater loss than myself.Oft would he say I was the oldest
acquaintance he had in England (when his father was in Ireland), it
being now of about thirty years, contracted abroad, when he rode in the
Academy in Paris, and when we were seldom asunder.His Majesty never lost a worthier subject, nor father a better or more
dutiful son; a loving, generous, good-natured, and perfectly obliging
friend; one who had done innumerable kindnesses to several before they
knew it; nor did he ever advance any that were not worthy; no one more
brave, more modest; none more humble, sober, and every way virtuous.Unhappy England in this illustrious person's loss!Universal was the
mourning for him, and the eulogies on him; I stayed night and day by his
bedside to his last gasp, to close his dear eyes!O sad father, mother,
wife, and children!He deserved all that a sincere
friend, a brave soldier, a virtuous courtier, a loyal subject, an honest
man, a bountiful master, and good Christian, could deserve of his prince
and country.One thing more let me note, that he often expressed to me
the abhorrence he had of that base and unworthy action which he was put
upon, of engaging the Smyrna fleet in time of peace, in which though he
behaved himself like a great captain, yet he told me it was the only
blot in his life, and troubled him exceedingly.Though he was commanded,
and never examined further when he was so, yet he always spoke of it
with regret and detestation.The Countess was at the seat of her
daughter, the Countess of Derby, about 200 miles off.I went to visit a French gentleman, one Monsieur
Chardin, who having been thrice in the East Indies, Persia, and other
remote countries, came hither in our return ships from those parts, and
it being reported that he was a very curious and knowing man, I was
desired by the Royal Society to salute him in their name, and to invite
him to honor them with his company.Sir Joseph Hoskins and Sir
Christopher Wren accompanied me.We found him at his lodgings in his
eastern habit, a very handsome person, extremely affable, a modest,
well-bred man, not inclined to talk wonders.He spoke Latin, and
understood Greek, Arabic, and Persian, from eleven years' travels in
those parts, whither he went in search of jewels, and was become very
rich.After the usual civilities, we
asked some account of the extraordinary things he must have seen in
traveling over land to those places where few, if any, northern
Europeans used to go, as the Black and Caspian Sea, Mingrelia, Bagdad,
Nineveh, Persepolis, etc.He told us that the things most worthy of our
sight would be, the draughts he had caused to be made of some noble
ruins, etc.; for that, besides his own little talent that way, he had
carried two good painters with him, to draw landscapes, measure and
design the remains of the palace which Alexander burned in his frolic at
Persepolis, with divers temples, columns, relievos, and statues, yet
extant, which he affirmed to be sculpture far exceeding anything he had
observed either at Rome, in Greece, or in any other part of the world
where magnificence was in estimation.He said there was an inscription
in letters not intelligible, though entire.He was sorry he could not
gratify the curiosity of the Society at present, his things not being
yet out of the ship; but would wait on them with them on his return from
Paris, whither he was going the next day, but with intention to return
suddenly, and stay longer here, the persecution in France not suffering
Protestants, and he was one, to be quiet.He told us that Nineveh was a vast city, now all buried in her ruins,
the inhabitants building on the subterranean vaults, which were, as
appeared, the first stories of the old city, that there were frequently
found huge vases of fine earth, columns, and other antiquities; that the
straw which the Egyptians required of the Israelites, was not to burn,
or cover the rows of bricks as we use, but being chopped small to mingle
with the clay, which being dried in the sun (for they bake not in the
furnace) would else cleave asunder; that in Persia are yet a race of
Ignicolae, who worship the sun and the fire as Gods; that the women of
Georgia and Mingrelia were universally, and without any compare, the
most beautiful creatures for shape, features, and figure, in the world,
and therefore the Grand Seignor and Bashaws had had from thence most of
their wives and concubines; that there had within these hundred years
been Amazons among them, that is to say, a sort or race of valiant
women, given to war; that Persia was extremely fertile; he spoke also of
Japan and China, and of the many great errors of our late geographers,
as we suggested matter for discourse.We then took our leave, failing of
seeing his papers; but it was told us by others that indeed he dared not
open, or show them, till he had first showed them to the French King;
but of this he himself said nothing.[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d September, 1680.I had an opportunity, his Majesty being still at
Windsor, of seeing his private library at Whitehall, at my full ease.I
went with expectation of finding some curiosities, but, though there
were about 1,000 volumes, there were few of importance which I had not
perused before.They consisted chiefly of such books as had from time to
time been dedicated, or presented to him; a few histories, some Travels
and French books, abundance of maps and sea charts, entertainments and
pomps, buildings and pieces relating to the navy, some mathematical
instruments; but what was most rare, were three or four Romish
breviaries, with a great deal of miniature and monkish painting and
gilding, one of which is most exquisitely done, both as to the figures,
grotesques, and compartments, to the utmost of that curious art.There
is another in which I find written by the hand of King Henry VII., his
giving it to his dear daughter, Margaret, afterward Queen of Scots, in
which he desires her to pray for his soul, subscribing his name at
length.There is also the process of the philosophers' great elixir,
represented in divers pieces of excellent miniature, but the discourse
is in high Dutch, a MS.in quarto, of above 300
years old, in French, being an institution of physic, and in the
botanical part the plants are curiously painted in miniature; also a
folio MS.of good thickness, being the several exercises, as Themes,
Orations, Translations, etc., of King Edward VI., all written and
subscribed by his own hand, and with his name very legible, and divers
of the Greek interleaved and corrected after the manner of schoolboys'
exercises, and that exceedingly well and proper; with some epistles to
his preceptor, which show that young prince to have been extraordinarily
advanced in learning, and as Cardan, who had been in England affirmed,
stupendously knowing for his age.There is likewise his journal, no less
testifying his early ripeness and care about the affairs of state.There are besides many pompous volumes, some embossed with gold, and
intaglios on agates, medals, etc.I spent three or four entire days,
locked up, and alone, among these books and curiosities.In the rest of
the private lodgings contiguous to this, are divers of the best pictures
of the great masters, Raphael, Titian, etc., and in my esteem, above
all, the "_Noli me tangere_" of our blessed Savior to Mary Magdalen
after his Resurrection, of Hans Holbein; than which I never saw so much
reverence and kind of heavenly astonishment expressed in a picture.There are also divers curious clocks, watches, and pendules of exquisite
work, and other curiosities.An ancient woman who made these lodgings
clean, and had all the keys, let me in at pleasure for a small reward,
by means of a friend.I dined with Sir Stephen Fox, now one of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury.This gentleman came first a poor boy from
the choir of Salisbury, then he was taken notice of by Bishop Duppa, and
afterward waited on my Lord Percy (brother to Algernon, Earl of
Northumberland), who procured for him an inferior place among the clerks
of the kitchen and Greencloth side, where he was found so humble,
diligent, industrious, and prudent in his behavior, that his Majesty
being in exile, and Mr.Fox waiting, both the King and Lords about him
frequently employed him about their affairs, and trusted him both with
receiving and paying the little money they had.Returning with his
Majesty to England, after great want and great sufferings, his Majesty
found him so honest and industrious, and withal so capable and ready,
that, being advanced from clerk of the kitchen to that of the
Greencloth, he procured to be paymaster of the whole army, and by his
dexterity and punctual dealing he obtained such credit among the
bankers, that he was in a short time able to borrow vast sums of them
upon any exigence.The continual turning thus of money, and the
soldiers' moderate allowance to him for keeping touch with them, did so
enrich him, that he is believed to be worth at least L200,000, honestly
got and unenvied; which is next to a miracle.With all this he continues
as humble and ready to do a courtesy as ever he was.He is generous, and lives very honorably, of a sweet nature,
well-spoken, well-bred, and is so highly in his Majesty's esteem, and so
useful, that being long since made a knight, he is also advanced to be
one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and has the reversion of
the Cofferer's place after Harry Brouncker.He has married his eldest
daughter to my Lord Cornwallis, and gave her L12,000, and restored that
entangled family besides.Trollop, who brings
with her (besides a great sum) near, if not altogether, L2,000 per
annum.Sir Stephen's lady (an excellent woman) is sister to Mr.Whittle,
one of the King's chirurgeons.In a word, never was man more fortunate
than Sir Stephen; he is a handsome person, virtuous, and very religious.Came to my house some German strangers and Signor
Pietro, a famous musician, who had been long in Sweden in Queen
Christina's Court; he sung admirably to a guitar, and had a perfect good
tenor and bass, and had set to Italian composure many of Abraham
Cowley's pieces which showed extremely well.He told me that in Sweden
the heat in some part of summer was as excessive as the cold in winter;
so cold, he affirmed, that the streets of all the towns are desolate, no
creatures stirring in them for many months, all the inhabitants retiring
to their stoves.He spoke high things of that romantic Queen's learning
and skill in languages, the majesty of her behavior, her exceeding wit,
and that the histories she had read of other countries, especially of
Italy and Rome, had made her despise her own.That the real occasion of
her resigning her crown was the nobleman's importuning her to marry, and
the promise which the Pope had made her of procuring her to be Queen of
Naples, which also caused her to change her religion; but she was
cheated by his crafty Holiness,[43] working on her ambition; that the
reason of her killing her secretary at Fontainebleau, was, his revealing
that intrigue with the Pope.But, after all this, I rather believe it
was her mad prodigality and extreme vanity, which had consumed those
vast treasures the great Adolphus, her father, had brought out of
Germany during his [campaigns] there and wonderful successes; and that,
if she had not voluntarily resigned, as foreseeing the event, the
Estates of her kingdom would have compelled her to do so.[Footnote 43: Pope Alexander VII., of the family of Chighi, at
    Sienna.][Sidenote: LONDON]

30th October, 1680.I went to London to be private, my birthday being
the next day, and I now arrived at my sixtieth year; on which I began a
more solemn survey of my whole life, in order to the making and
confirming my peace with God, by an accurate scrutiny of all my actions
past, as far as I was able to call them to mind.How difficult and
uncertain, yet how necessary a work!The Lord be merciful to me, and
accept me!Teach me, therefore, so to
number my days, that I may apply my heart unto wisdom, and make my
calling and election sure.A stranger
preached at Whitehall[44] on Luke xvi.15; the
Holy Communion followed, at which I participated, humbly imploring God's
assistance in the great work I was entering into.Margaret's, on Acts xvii.[Footnote 44: Probably to the King's household, very early in the
    morning, as the custom was.]I began and spent the whole week in examining my life, begging pardon
for my faults, assistance and blessing for the future, that I might, in
some sort, be prepared for the time that now drew near, and not have the
great work to begin, when one can work no longer.I therefore stirred little abroad till the 5th of
November, when I heard Dr.Tenison, the now vicar of St.Lloyd, the former incumbent, being made Bishop of St.I participated of the blessed Communion, finishing
and confirming my resolutions of giving myself up more entirely to God,
to whom I had now most solemnly devoted the rest of the poor remainder
of life in this world; the Lord enabling me, who am an unprofitable
servant, a miserable sinner, yet depending on his infinite goodness and
mercy accepting my endeavors.Came to dine with us Sir Richard Anderson, his
lady, son and wife, sister to my daughter-in-law.[Sidenote: LONDON]

30th November, 1680.The anniversary election at the Royal Society
brought me to London, where was chosen President that excellent person
and great philosopher, Mr.Robert Boyle, who indeed ought to have been
the very first; but neither his infirmity nor his modesty could now any
longer excuse him.I desired I might for this year be left out of the
Council, by reason my dwelling was in the country.The Society according
to custom dined together.The signal day begun the trial (at which I was present) of my Lord
Viscount Stafford, (for conspiring the death of the King), second son to
my Lord Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Earl Marshal of
England, and grandfather to the present Duke of Norfolk, whom I so well
knew, and from which excellent person I received so many favors.It was
likewise his birthday, The trial was in Westminster Hall, before the
King, Lords, and Commons, just in the same manner as, forty years past,
the great and wise Earl of Strafford (there being but one letter
differing their names) received his trial for pretended ill government
in Ireland, in the very same place, this Lord Stafford's father being
then High Steward.The place of sitting was now exalted some
considerable height from the paved floor of the hall, with a stage of
boards.The throne, woolsacks for the Judges, long forms for the Peers,
chair for the Lord Steward, exactly ranged, as in the House of Lords.The sides on both hands scaffolded to the very roof for the members of
the House of Commons.At the upper end, and on the right side of the
King's state, was a box for his Majesty, and on the left others for the
great ladies, and over head a gallery for ambassadors and public
ministers.At the lower end, or entrance, was a bar, and place for the
prisoner, the Lieutenant of the Tower of London, the ax-bearer and
guards, my Lord Stafford's two daughters, the Marchioness of Winchester
being one; there was likewise a box for my Lord to retire into.At the
right hand, in another box, somewhat higher, stood the witnesses; at the
left, the managers, in the name of the Commons of England, namely,
Serjeant Maynard (the great lawyer, the same who prosecuted the cause
against the Earl of Strafford forty years before, being now near eighty
years of age), Sir William Jones, late Attorney-General, Sir Francis
Winnington, a famous pleader, and Mr.Treby, now Recorder of London, not
appearing in their gowns as lawyers, but in their cloaks and swords, as
representing the Commons of England: to these were joined Mr.Poule, Colonel Titus, Sir Thomas Lee, all gentlemen
of quality, and noted parliamentary men.The first two days, in which
were read the commission and impeachment, were but a tedious entrance
into matter of fact, at which I was but little present.But, on
Thursday, I was commodiously seated among the Commons, when the
witnesses were sworn and examined.Oates
swore that he delivered a commission to Viscount Stafford from the Pope,
to be Paymaster-General to an army intended to be raised; Dugdale, that
being at Lord Aston's, the prisoner dealt with him plainly to murder his
Majesty; and Turberville, that at Paris he also proposed the same to
him.The depositions of my Lord's witnesses were taken, to
invalidate the King's witnesses; they were very slight persons, but,
being fifteen or sixteen, they took up all that day, and in truth they
rather did my Lord more injury than service.Came other witnesses of the Commons to corroborate
the King's, some being Peers, some Commons, with others of good quality,
who took off all the former day's objections, and set the King's
witnesses _recti in curia_.Sir William Jones summed up the evidence; to him
succeeded all the rest of the managers, and then Mr.Henry Poule made a
vehement oration.After this my Lord, as on all occasions, and often
during the trial, spoke in his own defense, denying the charge
altogether, and that he had never seen Oates, or Turberville, at the
time and manner affirmed: in truth, their testimony did little weigh
with me; Dugdale's only seemed to press hardest, to which my Lord spoke
a great while, but confusedly, without any method.One thing my Lord said as to Oates, which I confess did exceedingly
affect me: That a person who during his depositions should so vauntingly
brag that though he went over to the Church of Rome, yet he was never a
<DW7>, nor of their religion, all the time that he seemed to apostatize
from the Protestant, but only as a spy; though he confessed he took
their sacrament; worshiped images, went through all their oaths and
discipline of their proselytes, swearing secrecy and to be faithful, but
with intent to come over again and betray them; that such a hypocrite,
that had so deeply prevaricated as even to turn idolater (for so we of
the Church of England termed it), attesting God so solemnly that he was
entirely theirs and devoted to their interest, and consequently (as he
pretended) trusted; I say, that the witness of such a profligate wretch
should be admitted against the life of a peer,--this my Lord looked upon
as a monstrous thing, and such as must needs redound to the dishonor of
our religion and nation.And verily I am of his Lordship's opinion: such
a man's testimony should not be taken against the life of a dog.But the
merit of something material which he discovered against Coleman, put him
in such esteem with the Parliament, that now, I fancy, he stuck at
nothing, and thought everybody was to take what he said for Gospel.The
consideration of this, and some other circumstances, began to stagger
me; particularly how it was possible that one who went among the <DW7>s
on such a design, and pretended to be intrusted with so many letters and
commissions from the Pope and the party,--nay, and delivered them to so
many great persons,--should not reserve one of them to show, nor so much
as one copy of any commission, which he who had such dexterity in
opening letters might certainly have done, to the undeniable conviction
of those whom he accused; but, as I said, he gained credit on Coleman.But, as to others whom he so madly flew upon, I am little inclined to
believe his testimony, he being so slight a person, so passionate, ill
bred, and of such impudent behavior; nor is it likely that such piercing
politicians as the Jesuits should trust him with so high and so
dangerous secrets.On Tuesday, I was again at the trial, when judgment
was demanded; and, after my Lord had spoken what he could in denying the
fact, the managers answering the objections, the Peers adjourned to
their House, and within two hours returned again.There was, in the
meantime, this question put to the judges, "whether there being but one
witness to any single crime, or act, it could amount to convict a man of
treason."They gave an unanimous opinion that in case of treason they
all were overt acts for though no man should be condemned by one witness
for any one act, yet for several acts to the same intent, it was valid;
which was my Lord's case.This being past, and the Peers in their seats
again, the Lord Chancellor Finch (this day the Lord High-Steward)
removing to the woolsack next his Majesty's state, after summoning the
Lieutenant of the Tower to bring forth his prisoner, and proclamation
made for silence, demanded of every Peer (who were in all eighty-six)
whether William, Lord Viscount Stafford, were guilty of the treason laid
to his charge, or not guilty.Then the Peer spoken to, standing up, and laying his right hand upon his
breast, said guilty, or not guilty, upon my honor, and then sat down,
the Lord Steward noting their suffrages as they answered upon a paper:
when all had done, the number of not guilty being but 31, the guilty 55;
and then, after proclamation for silence again, the Lord Steward
directing his speech to the prisoner, against whom the ax was turned
edgeways and not before, in aggravation of his crime, he being ennobled
by the King's father, and since received many favors from his present
Majesty: after enlarging on his offense, deploring first his own
unhappiness that he who had never condemned any man before should now be
necessitated to begin with him, he then pronounced sentence of death by
hanging, drawing, and quartering, according to form, with great
solemnity and dreadful gravity; and, after a short pause, told the
prisoner that he believed the Lords would intercede for the omission of
some circumstances of his sentence, beheading only excepted; and then
breaking his white staff, the Court was dissolved.My Lord Stafford
during all this latter part spoke but little, and only gave their
Lordships thanks after the sentence was pronounced; and indeed behaved
himself modestly, and as became him.It was observed that all his own relations of his name and family
condemned him, except his nephew, the Earl of Arundel, son to the Duke
of Norfolk.And it must be acknowledged that the whole trial was carried
on with exceeding gravity: so stately and august an appearance I had
never seen before; for, besides the innumerable spectators of gentlemen
and foreign ministers, who saw and heard all the proceedings, the
prisoner had the consciences of all the Commons of England for his
accusers, and all the Peers to be his judges and jury.He had likewise
the assistance of what counsel he would, to direct him in his plea, who
stood by him.And yet I can hardly think that a person of his age and
experience should engage men whom he never saw before (and one of them
that came to visit him as a stranger at Paris) POINT BLANK to murder the
King: God only, who searches hearts, can discover the truth.Lord
Stafford was not a man beloved especially of his own family.This evening, looking out of my chamber window
toward the west, I saw a meteor of an obscure bright color, very much in
shape like the blade of a sword, the rest of the sky very serene and
clear.What this may portend, God only knows; but such another
phenomenon I remember to have seen in 1640, about the trial of the great
Earl of Strafford, preceding our bloody Rebellion.We have had of late several comets, which though I believe
appear from natural causes, and of themselves operate not, yet I cannot
despise them.They may be warnings from God, as they commonly are
forerunners of his animadversions.After many days and nights of snow,
cloudy and dark weather, the comet was very much wasted.My daughter-in-law was brought to bed of a son,
christened Richard.A solemn public Fast that God would prevent all
Popish plots, avert his judgments, and give a blessing to the
proceedings of Parliament now assembled, and which struck at the
succession of the Duke of York.The Viscount Stafford was beheaded on Towerhill.I was at the wedding of my nephew, John Evelyn
of Wotton, married by the Bishop of Rochester at Westminster, in Henry
VII.'s chapel, to the daughter and heir of Mr.Eversfield, of Sussex,
her portion L8,000.The solemnity was kept with a few friends only at
Lady Beckford's, the lady's mother.Visited and dined at the Earl of Essex's, with whom I
spent most of the afternoon alone.Thence to my (yet living) godmother
and kinswoman, Mrs.Keightley, sister to Sir Thomas Evelyn and niece to
my father, being now eighty-six years of age, sprightly, and in perfect
health, her eyes serving her as well as ever, and of a comely
countenance, that one would not suppose her above fifty.Great
expectation of his Royal Highness's case as to the succession, against
which the House was set.An extraordinary sharp, cold spring, not yet a leaf on the trees, frost
and snow lying: while the whole nation was in the greatest ferment.Asaph) at
his house in Leicester Fields, now going to reside in his diocese.Brisbane's, Secretary to the Admiralty,
a learned and industrious person, whither came Dr.Burnet, to thank me
for some papers I had contributed toward his excellent "History of the
Reformation."[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th April, 1681.I dined at Don Pietro Ronquillo's, the Spanish
Ambassador, at Wild House, who used me with extraordinary civility.The
dinner was plentiful, half after the Spanish, half after the English
way.After dinner, he led me into his bedchamber, where we fell into a
long discourse concerning religion.Though he was a learned man in
politics, and an advocate, he was very ignorant in religion, and unable
to defend any point of controversy; he was, however, far from being
fierce.At parting, he earnestly wished me to apply humbly to the
blessed virgin to direct me, assuring me that he had known divers who
had been averse from the Roman Catholic religion, wonderfully
enlightened and convinced by her intercession.He importuned me to come
and visit him often.Came to dine with me Sir William Fermor, of
Northamptonshire, and Sir Christopher Wren, his Majesty's architect and
surveyor, now building the Cathedral of St.Paul, and the column in
memory of the city's conflagration, and was in hand with the building of
fifty parish churches.Came my Lady Sunderland, to desire that I would propose
a match to Sir Stephen Fox for her son, Lord Spencer, to marry Mrs.I excused myself all I was able; for the
truth is, I was afraid he would prove an extravagant man: for, though a
youth of extraordinary parts, and had an excellent education to render
him a worthy man, yet his early inclinations to extravagance made me
apprehensive, that I should not serve Sir Stephen by proposing it, like
a friend; this being now his only daughter, well-bred, and likely to
receive a large share of her father's opulence.Lord Sunderland was much
sunk in his estate by gaming and other prodigalities, and was now no
longer Secretary of State, having fallen into displeasure of the King
for siding with the Commons about the succession; but which, I am
assured, he did not do out of his own inclination, or for the
preservation of the Protestant religion, but by mistaking the ability of
the party to carry it.However, so earnest and importunate was the
Countess, that I did mention it to Sir Stephen, who said it was too
great an honor, that his daughter was very young, as well as my Lord,
and he was resolved never to marry her without the parties' mutual
liking; with other objections which I neither would or could contradict.He desired me to express to the Countess the great sense he had of the
honor done him, that his daughter and her son were too young, that he
would do nothing without her liking, which he did not think her capable
of expressing judiciously, till she was sixteen or seventeen years of
age, of which she now wanted four years, and that I would put it off as
civilly as I could.Our new curate preached, a pretty hopeful young man, yet
somewhat raw, newly come from college, full of Latin sentences, which in
time will wear off.There came to visit me Sir William Walter and Sir John
Elowes: and the next day, the Earl of Kildare, a young gentleman related
to my wife, and other company.There had scarce fallen any rain since
Christmas.I went to Hampton Court, when the Surrey gentlemen
presented their addresses to his Majesty, whose hand I kissed,
introduced by the Duke of Albemarle.Being at the Privy Council, I took
another occasion of discoursing with Sir Stephen Fox about his daughter
and to revive that business, and at least brought it to this: That in
case the young people liked one the other, after four years, he first
desiring to see a particular of my Lord's present estate if I could
transmit it to him privately, he would make her portion L14,000, though
to all appearance he might likely make it L50,000 as easily, his eldest
son having no child and growing very corpulent.It still continued so great a drought as had never been
known in England, and it was said to be universal.No sermon this afternoon, which I think did not
happen twice in this parish these thirty years; so gracious has God been
to it, and indeed to the whole nation: God grant that we abuse not this
great privilege either by our wantonness, schism, or unfaithfulness,
under such means as he has not favored any other nation under Heaven
besides![Sidenote: WOTTON]

23d August, 1681.I went to Wotton, and, on the following day, was
invited to Mr.Denzil Onslow's at his seat at Purford, where was much
company, and such an extraordinary feast, as I had hardly seen at any
country gentleman's table.What made it more remarkable was, that there
was not anything save what his estate about it did afford; as venison,
rabbits, hares, pheasants, partridges, pigeons, quails, poultry, all
sorts of fowl in season from his own decoy near his house, and all sorts
of fresh fish.After dinner we went to see sport at the decoy, where I
never saw so many herons.The seat stands on a flat, the ground pasture, rarely watered, and
exceedingly improved since Mr.Onslow bought it of Sir Robert Parkhurst,
who spent a fair estate.The house is timber, but commodious, and with
one ample dining-room, the hall adorned with paintings of fowl and
huntings, etc., the work of Mr.Barlow, who is excellent in this kind
from the life.Hussey (at Sutton in
Shere), who has a very pretty seat well watered, near my brother's.He
is the neatest husband for curious ordering his domestic and field
accommodations, and what pertains to husbandry, that I have ever seen,
as to his granaries, tacklings, tools, and utensils, plows, carts,
stables, wood piles, wood houses, even to hen roosts and hog troughs.Methought, I saw old Cato, or Varro, in him; all substantial, all in
exact order.The sole inconvenience he lies under, is the great quantity
of sand which the stream brings along with it, and fills his canals and
receptacles for fish too soon.The rest of my time of stay at Wotton was
spent in walking about the grounds and goodly woods, where I have in my
youth so often entertained my solitude; and so, on the 2d of September,
I once more returned to my home.Died my pretty grandchild, and was interred on the
8th [at Deptford].Dined with Sir Stephen Fox, who proposed to me the
purchasing of Chelsea College, which his Majesty had sometime since
given to our Society, and would now purchase it again to build a
hospital; or infirmary for soldiers there, in which he desired my
assistance as one of the Council of the Royal Society.I had another opportunity of visiting his
Majesty's private library at Whitehall.To Sir Samuel Morland's, to see his house and mechanics.I went with Monsieur Faubert about taking the
Countess of Bristol's house for an academy, he being lately come from
Paris for his religion, and resolving to settle here.I went to see Sir Thomas Bond's fine house and
garden at Peckham.I went to Camberwell, where that good man Dr.Parr
(late chaplain to Archbishop Usher) preached on Acts xvi.To Fulham, to visit the Bishop of London, in whose
garden I first saw the _Sedum arborescens_ in flower, which was
exceedingly beautiful.16, 17, before the
King, of the usurpation of the Church of Rome.This is one of the first
rank of pulpit men in the nation.I dined with the Earl of Essex who, after dinner
in his study, where we were alone, related to me how much he had been
scandalized and injured in the report of his being privy to the marriage
of his Lady's niece, the rich young widow of the late Lord Ogle, sole
daughter of the Earl of Northumberland; showing me a letter of Mr.Thynn's, excusing himself for not communicating his marriage to his
Lordship.He acquainted me also with the whole story of that unfortunate
lady being betrayed by her grandmother, the Countess of Northumberland,
and Colonel Bret, for money; and that though, upon the importunity of
the Duke of Monmouth, he had delivered to the grandmother a particular
of the jointure which Mr.Thynn pretended he would settle on the lady,
yet he totally discouraged the proceeding as by no means a competent
match for one that both by birth and fortune might have pretended to the
greatest prince in Christendom; that he also proposed the Earl of
Kingston, or the Lord Cranburn, but was by no means for Mr.[Sidenote: LONDON]

19th November, 1681.I dined with my worthy friend, Mr.Erskine, Master
of the Charter House, uncle to the Duchess of Monmouth; a wise and
learned gentleman, fitter to have been a privy councillor and minister
of state than to have been laid aside.I was at the audience of the Russian Ambassador
before both their Majesties in the Banqueting House.The presents were
carried before him, held up by his followers in two ranks before the
King's State, and consisted of tapestry (one suite of which was
doubtlessly brought from France as being of that fabric, the Ambassador
having passed through that kingdom as he came out of Spain), a large
Persian carpet, furs of sable and ermine, etc.; but nothing was so
splendid and exotic as the Ambassador who came soon after the King's
restoration.This present Ambassador was exceedingly offended that his
coach was not permitted to come into the Court, till, being told that no
King's Ambassador did, he was pacified, yet requiring an attestation of
it under the hand of Sir Charles Cotterell, the Master of the
Ceremonies; being, it seems, afraid he should offend his Master, if he
omitted the least punctilio.It was reported he condemned his son to
lose his head for shaving off his beard, and putting himself in the
French mode at Paris, and that he would have executed it, had not the
French King interceded--but qy.Sir Christopher Wren chosen President [of the Royal
Society], Mr.Plot, the ingenious author of
the "History of Oxfordshire."I saw the audience of the Morocco Ambassador,
his retinue not numerous.He was received in the Banqueting House, both
their Majesties being present.He came up to the throne without making
any sort of reverence, not bowing his head, or body.He spoke by a
renegado Englishman, for whose safe return there was a promise.They
were all clad in the Moorish habit, cassocks of  cloth, or silk,
with buttons and loops, over this an _alhaga_, or white woolen mantle,
so large as to wrap both head and body, a sash, or small turban,
naked-legged and armed, but with leather socks like the Turks, rich
scymetar, and large calico sleeved shirts.The Ambassador had a string
of pearls oddly woven in his turban.I fancy the old Roman habit was
little different as to the mantle and naked limbs.He was a handsome
person, well featured, of a wise look, subtle, and extremely civil.Their presents were lions and ostriches; their errand about a peace at
Tangier.But the concourse and tumult of the people was intolerable, so
as the officers could keep no order, which these strangers were
astonished at first, there being nothing so regular, exact, and
performed with such silence, as is on all these public occasions of
their country, and indeed over all the Turkish dominions.Dined at the Bishop of Rochester's, at the Abbey, it
being his marriage day, after twenty-four years.He related to me how he
had been treated by Sir William Temple, foreseeing that he might be a
delegate in the concern of my Lady Ogle now likely come in controversy
upon her marriage with Mr.Thynn; also how earnestly the late Earl of
Danby, Lord Treasurer, sought his friendship, and what plain and sincere
advice he gave him from time to time about his miscarriages and
partialities; particularly his outing Sir John Duncomb from being
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Sir Stephen Fox, above all, from being
Paymaster of the Army.The Treasurer's excuse and reason was, that Fox's
credit was so over great with the bankers and monied men, that he could
procure none but by his means, "for that reason," replied the Bishop, "I
would have made him my friend, Sir Stephen being a person both honest
and of credit."He told him likewise of his stateliness and difficulty
of access, and several other miscarriages, and which indeed made him
hated.To the Royal Society, where at the Council we
passed a new law for the more accurate consideration of candidates, as
whether they would really be useful; also concerning the honorary
members, that none should be admitted but by diploma.[Sidenote: LONDON]

This evening I was at the entertainment of the Morocco Ambassador at the
Duchess of Portsmouth's glorious apartments at Whitehall, where was a
great banquet of sweetmeats and music; but at which both the Ambassador
and his retinue behaved themselves with extraordinary moderation and
modesty, though placed about a long table, a lady between two Moors, and
among these were the King's natural children, namely, Lady Lichfield and
Sussex, the Duchess of Portsmouth, Nelly, etc., concubines, and cattle
of that sort, as splendid as jewels and excess of bravery could make
them; the Moors neither admiring nor seeming to regard anything,
furniture or the like, with any earnestness, and but decently tasting of
the banquet.They drank a little milk and water, but not a drop of wine;
they also drank of a sorbet and jacolatt;[45] did not look about, or
stare on the ladies, or express the least surprise, but with a courtly
negligence in pace, countenance, and whole behavior, answering only to
such questions as were asked with a great deal of wit and gallantry, and
so gravely took leave with this compliment, that God would bless the
Duchess of Portsmouth and the Prince, her son meaning the little Duke of
Richmond.The King came in at the latter end, just as the Ambassador was
going away.In this manner was this slave (for he was no more at home)
entertained by most of the nobility in town, and went often to Hyde Park
on horseback, where he and his retinue showed their extraordinary
activity in horsemanship, and flinging and catching their lances at full
speed; they rode very short, and could stand upright at full speed,
managing their spears with incredible agility.He went sometimes to the
theaters, where, upon any foolish or fantastical action, he could not
forbear laughing, but he endeavored to hide it with extraordinary
modesty and gravity.In a word, the Russian Ambassador, still at Court
behaved himself like a clown compared to this civil heathen.This evening, Sir Stephen Fox acquainted me again
with his Majesty's resolution of proceeding in the erection of a Royal
Hospital for emerited soldiers on that spot of ground which the Royal
Society had sold to his Majesty for L1,300, and that he would settle
L5,000 per annum on it, and build to the value of L20,000 for the relief
and reception of four companies, namely, 400 men, to be as in a college,
or monastery.I was therefore desired by Sir Stephen (who had not only
the whole managing of this, but was, as I perceived, himself to be a
grand benefactor, as well it became him who had gotten so vast an estate
by the soldiers) to assist him, and consult what method to cast it in,
as to the government.So, in his study we arranged the governor,
chaplain, steward, housekeeper, chirurgeon, cook, butler, gardener,
porter, and other officers, with their several salaries and
entertainments.I would needs have a library, and mentioned several
books, since some soldiers might possibly be studious, when they were at
leisure to recollect.Thus we made the first calculations, and set down
our thoughts to be considered and digested better, to show his Majesty
and the Archbishop.He also engaged me to consider of what laws and
orders were fit for the government, which was to be in every respect as
strict as in any religious convent.After supper, came in the famous treble, Mr.Abel, newly returned from
Italy; I never heard a more excellent voice; one would have sworn it had
been a woman's, it was so high, and so well and skillfully managed,
being accompanied by Signor Francesco on the harpsichord.Pepys, late Secretary to the Admiralty, showed
me a large folio containing the whole mechanic part and art of building
royal ships and men-of-war, made by Sir Anthony Dean, being so accurate
a piece from the very keel to the lead block, rigging, guns, victualing,
manning, and even to every individual pin and nail, in a method so
astonishing and curious, with a draught, both geometrical and in
perspective, and several sections, that I do not think the world can
show the like.My daughter, Mary, began to learn music of Signor
Bartholomeo, and dancing of Monsieur Isaac, reputed the best masters.Having had several violent fits of an ague, recourse was had to bathing
my legs in milk up to the knees, made as hot as I could endure it: and
sitting so in it in a deep churn, or vessel, covered with blankets, and
drinking _carduus_ posset, then going to bed and sweating, I not only
missed that expected fit, but had no more, only continued weak, that I
could not go to church till Ash Wednesday, which I had not missed, I
think, so long in twenty years, so gracious had God been to me.After this warning and admonition, I now began to look over and
methodize all my writings, accounts, letters, papers; inventoried the
goods, and other articles of the house, and put things into the best
order I could, and made my will; that now, growing in years, I might
have none of these secular things and concerns to distract me, when it
should please Almighty God to call me from this transitory life.With
this, I prepared some special meditations and devotions for the time of
sickness.The Lord Jesus grant them to be salutary for my poor soul in
that day, that I may obtain mercy and acceptance!My second grandchild was born, and christened the next
day by our vicar at Sayes Court, by the name of John.[46] I beseech God
to bless him![Footnote 46: Who became his successor, and was created a baronet in
    1713.]I went to church: our vicar preached on
Proverbs, showing what care and vigilance was required for the keeping
of the heart upright.The Holy Communion followed, on which I gave God
thanks for his gracious dealing with me in my late sickness, and
affording me this blessed opportunity of praising him in the
congregation, and receiving the cup of salvation with new and serious
resolutions.Came to see and congratulate my recovery, Sir John Lowther, Mr.Pepys, Sir Anthony Deane, and Mr.This day was executed Colonel Vrats, and some of his
accomplices, for the execrable murder of Mr.Thynn, set on by the
principal Koningsmark.He went to execution like an undaunted hero, as
one that had done a friendly office for that base coward, Count
Koningsmark, who had hopes to marry his widow, the rich Lady Ogle, and
was acquitted by a corrupt jury, and so got away.Vrats told a friend of
mine who accompanied him to the gallows, and gave him some advice that
he did not value dying of a rush, and hoped and believed God would deal
with him like a gentleman.Never man went, so unconcerned for his sad
fate.I went to see the corpse of that obstinate creature,
Colonel Vrats, the King permitting that his body should be transported
to his own country, he being of a good family, and one of the first
embalmed by a particular art, invented by one William Russell, a
coffin-maker, which preserved the body without disboweling, or to
appearance using any bituminous matter.The flesh was florid, soft, and
full, as if the person were only sleeping.He had now been dead near
fifteen days, and lay exposed in a very rich coffin lined with lead, too
magnificent for so daring and horrid a murderer.[Sidenote: LONDON]

At the meeting of the Royal Society were exhibited some pieces of amber
sent by the Duke of Brandenburg, in one of which was a spider, in
another a gnat, both very entire.There was a discourse of the tingeing
of glass, especially with red, and the difficulty of finding any red
color effectual to penetrate glass, among the glass-painters; that the
most diaporous, as blue, yellow, etc., did not enter into the substance
of what was ordinarily painted, more than very shallow, unless
incorporated in the metal itself, other reds and whites not at all
beyond the superfices.To the Royal Society, where at a Council was regulated
what collections should be published monthly, as formerly the
transactions, which had of late been discontinued, but were now much
called for by the curious abroad and at home.I went this afternoon with several of the Royal
Society to a supper which was all dressed, both fish and flesh, in
Monsieur Papin's digestors, by which the hardest bones of beef itself,
and mutton, were made as soft as cheese, without water or other liquor,
and with less than eight ounces of coals, producing an incredible
quantity of gravy; and for close of all, a jelly made of the bones of
beef, the best for clearness and good relish, and the most delicious
that I had ever seen, or tasted.We ate pike and other fish, bones and
all, without impediment; but nothing exceeded the pigeons, which tasted
just as if baked in a pie, all these being stewed in their own juice,
without any addition of water save what swam about the digestor, as _in
balneo_; the natural juice of all these provisions acting on the grosser
substances, reduced the hardest bones to tenderness; but it is best
descanted with more particulars for extracting tinctures, preserving and
stewing fruit, and saving fuel, in Dr.Papin's book, published and
dedicated to our Society of which he is a member.He is since gone to
Venice with the late Resident here (and also a member of our Society),
who carried this excellent mechanic, philosopher, and physician, to set
up a philosophical meeting in that city.This philosophical supper
caused much mirth among us, and exceedingly pleased all the company.I
sent a glass of the jelly to my wife, to the reproach of all that the
ladies ever made of their best hartshorn.[47]

    possessed so remarkable a knowledge of mathematics, that he very
    nearly brought the invention of the steam engine into working order.Boyle in his pneumatic experiments, and was
    afterward mathematical professor at Marburg.The season was unusually wet, with rain and thunder.I was desired by Sir Stephen Fox and Sir Christopher
Wren to accompany them to Lambeth, with the plot and design of the
college to be built at Chelsea, to have the Archbishop's approbation.It
was a quadrangle of 200 feet square, after the dimensions of the larger
quadrangle at Christ church, Oxford, for the accommodation of 440
persons, with governor and officers.The Duke and Duchess of York were just now come to London, after his
escape and shipwreck, as he went by sea for Scotland.At the Rolls' chapel preached the famous Dr.10, describing excellently well what was meant by election;
viz, not the effect of any irreversible decree, but so called because
they embraced the Gospel readily, by which they became elect, or
precious to God.It would be very needless to make our calling and
election sure, were they irreversible and what the rigid Presbyterians
pretend.Lawrence's church, a new and cheerful
pile.I gave notice to the Bishop of Rochester of what
Maimburg had published about the motives of the late Duchess of York's
perversion, in his "History of Calvinism;" and did myself write to the
Bishop of Winchester about it, who being concerned in it, I urged him to
set forth his vindication.The Morocco Ambassador being admitted an honorary member
of the Royal Society, and subscribing his name and titles in Arabic, I
was deputed by the Council to go and compliment him.The Bantam, or East India Ambassadors (at this time we
had in London the Russian, Moroccan, and Indian Ambassadors), being
invited to dine at Lord George Berkeley's (now Earl), I went to the
entertainment to contemplate the exotic guests.They were both very
hard-favored, and much resembling in countenance some sort of monkeys.We ate at two tables, the Ambassadors and interpreter by themselves.Their garments were rich Indian silks, flowered with gold, viz, a close
waistcoat to their knees, drawers, naked legs, and on their heads caps
made like fruit baskets.They wore poisoned daggers at their bosoms, the
hafts carved with some ugly serpents' or devils' heads, exceedingly
keen, and of Damascus metal.The second Ambassador
(sent it seems to succeed in case the first should die by the way in so
tedious a journey), having been at Mecca, wore a Turkish or Arab sash, a
little part of the linen hanging down behind his neck, with some other
difference of habit, and was half a <DW64>, bare legged and naked feet,
and deemed a very holy man.They sat cross-legged like Turks, and
sometimes in the posture of apes and monkeys; their nails and teeth as
black as jet, and shining, which being the effect, as to their teeth, of
perpetually chewing betel to preserve them from the toothache, much
raging in their country, is esteemed beautiful.The first ambassador was of an olive hue, a flat face, narrow eyes,
squat nose, and Moorish lips, no hair appeared; they wore several rings
of silver, gold and copper on their fingers, which was a token of
knighthood, or nobility.They were of Java Major, whose princes have
been turned Mahometans not above fifty years since; the inhabitants are
still pagans and idolaters.They seemed of a dull and heavy
constitution, not wondering at any thing they saw; but exceedingly
astonished how our law gave us propriety in our estates, and so thinking
we were all kings, for they could not be made to comprehend how subjects
could possess anything but at the pleasure of their Prince, they being
all slaves; they were pleased with the notion, and admired our
happiness.They were very sober, and I believe subtle in their way.Their meat was cooked, carried up, and they attended by several fat
slaves, who had no covering save drawers, which appeared very uncouth
and loathsome.They ate their pilaw, and other spoon-meat, without
spoons, taking up their pottage in the hollow of their fingers, and very
dexterously flung it into their mouths without spilling a drop.Came to dine with me, the Duke of Grafton and the young
Earl of Ossory, son to my most dear deceased friend.Went to visit our good neighbor, Mr.Bohun, whose whole
house is a cabinet of all elegancies, especially Indian; in the hall are
contrivances of Japan screens, instead of wainscot; and there is an
excellent pendule clock inclosed in the curious flowerwork of Mr.Gibbons, in the middle of the vestibule.The landscapes of the screens
represent the manner of living, and country of the Chinese.But, above
all, his lady's cabinet is adorned on the fret, ceiling, and
chimney-piece, with Mr.There are also some of
Streeter's best paintings, and many rich curiosities of gold and silver
as growing in the mines.The gardens are exactly kept, and the whole
place very agreeable and well watered.The owners are good neighbors,
and Mr.Bohun has also built and endowed a hospital for eight poor
people, with a pretty chapel, and every necessary accommodation.To the Bishop of London at Fulham, to review the
additions which Mr.Marshall had made to his curious book of flowers in
miniature, and collection of insects.With Sir Stephen Fox, to survey the foundations of the
Royal Hospital begun at Chelsea.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th August, 1682.The Council of the Royal Society had it recommended
to them to be trustees and visitors, or supervisors, of the Academy
which Monsieur Faubert did hope to procure to be built by subscription
of worthy gentlemen and noblemen, for the education of youth, and to
lessen the vast expense the nation is at yearly by sending children into
France to be taught military exercises.We thought to give him all the
encouragement our recommendation could procure.Rogers, an acquaintance of mine
long since at Padua.He was then Consul of the English nation, and
student in that University, where he proceeded Doctor in Physic;
presenting me now with the Latin oration he lately made upon the famous
Dr.Harvey's anniversary in the College of Physicians, at London.This night I saw another comet, near Cancer, very
bright, but the stream not so long as the former.Supped at Lord Clarendon's, with Lord Hyde, his
brother, now the great favorite, who invited himself to dine at my house
the Tuesday following.Being my birthday, and I now entering my great
climacterical of 63, after serious recollections of the years past,
giving Almighty God thanks for all his merciful preservations and
forbearance, begging pardon for my sins and unworthiness, and his
blessing on me the year entering, I went with my Lady Fox to survey her
building, and give some directions for the garden at Chiswick; the
architect is Mr.May,--somewhat heavy and thick, and not so well
understood: the garden much too narrow, the place without water, near a
highway, and near another great house of my Lord Burlington, little land
about it, so that I wonder at the expense; but women will have their
will.I was invited to dine with Monsieur Lionberg, the
Swedish Resident, who made a magnificent entertainment, it being the
birthday of his King.There dined the Duke of Albemarle, Duke of
Hamilton, Earl of Bath, Earl of Aylesbury, Lord Arran, Lord Castlehaven,
the son of him who was executed fifty years before, and several great
persons.I was exceedingly afraid of drinking (it being a Dutch feast),
but the Duke of Albemarle being that night to wait on his Majesty,
excess was prohibited; and, to prevent all, I stole away and left the
company as soon as we rose from table.[Sidenote: LONDON]

28th November, 1682.I went to the Council of the Royal Society, for the
auditing the last year's account, where I was surprised with a fainting
fit that for a time took away my sight; but God being merciful to me, I
recovered it after a short repose.I was exceedingly endangered and importuned to
stand the election,[48] having so many voices, but by favor of my
friends, and regard of my remote dwelling, and now frequent infirmities,
I desired their suffrages might be transferred to Sir John Hoskins, one
of the Masters of Chancery; a most learned virtuoso as well as lawyer,
who accordingly was elected.[Footnote 48: For President of the Royal Society.]Went to congratulate Lord Hyde (the great favorite)
newly made Earl of Rochester, and lately marrying his eldest daughter to
the Earl of Ossory.I sold my East India adventure of L250 principal
for L750 to the Royal Society, after I had been in that company
twenty-five years, being extraordinarily advantageous, by the blessing
of God.Sir Francis North, son to the Lord North, and Lord
Chief Justice, being made Lord Keeper on the death of the Earl of
Nottingham, the Lord Chancellor, I went to congratulate him.He is a
most knowing, learned, and ingenious man, and, besides being an
excellent person, of an ingenious and sweet disposition, very skillful
in music, painting, the new philosophy, and politer studies.Supped at Sir Joseph Williamson's, where was a
select company of our Society, Sir William Petty, Dr.Gale (that learned
schoolmaster of St.The
conversation was philosophical and cheerful, on divers considerable
questions proposed; as of the hereditary succession of the Roman
Emperors; the Pica mentioned in the preface to our Common Prayer, which
signifies only the Greek _Kalendarium_.James's, when I saw the sea
charts of Captain Collins, which that industrious man now brought to
show the Duke, having taken all the coasting from the mouth of the
Thames, as far as Wales, and exactly measuring every creek, island,
rock, soundings, harbors, sands, and tides, intending next spring to
proceed till he had finished the whole island, and that measured by
chains and other instruments: a most exact and useful undertaking.He
affirmed, that of all the maps put out since, there are none extant so
true as those of Joseph Norden, who gave us the first in Queen
Elizabeth's time; all since him are erroneous.This morning I received the news of the death of my
father-in-law, Sir Richard Browne, Knt.and Bart., who died at my house
at Sayes Court this day at ten in the morning, after he had labored
under the gout and dropsy for nearly six months, in the 78th year of his
age.The funeral was solemnized on the 19th at Deptford, with as much
decency as the dignity of the person, and our relation to him, required;
there being invited the Bishop of Rochester, several noblemen, knights,
and all the fraternity of the Trinity Company, of which he had been
Master, and others of the country.The vicar preached a short but proper
discourse on Psalm xxxix.10, on the frailty of our mortal condition,
concluding with an ample and well-deserved eulogy on the defunct,
relating to his honorable birth and ancestors, education, learning in
Greek and Latin, modern languages, travels, public employments, signal
loyalty, character abroad, and particularly the honor of supporting the
Church of England in its public worship during its persecution by the
late rebels' usurpation and regicide, by the suffrages of divers
Bishops, Doctors of the Church, and others, who found such an asylum in
his house and family at Paris, that in their disputes with the <DW7>s
(then triumphing over it as utterly lost) they used to argue for its
visibility and existence from Sir R. Browne's chapel and assembly there.Then he spoke of his great and loyal sufferings during thirteen years'
exile with his present Majesty, his return with him in the signal year
1660; his honorable employment at home, his timely recess to recollect
himself, his great age, infirmities, and death.He gave to the Trinity Corporation that land in Deptford on which are
built those almshouses for twenty-four widows of emerited seamen.He was
born the famous year of the Gunpowder Treason, in 1605, and being the
last [male] of his family, left my wife, his only daughter, heir.His
grandfather, Sir Richard Browne, was the great instrument under the
great Earl of Leicester (favorite to Queen Elizabeth) in his government
of the Netherland.He was Master of the Household to King James, and
Cofferer; I think was the first who regulated the compositions through
England for the King's household, provisions, progresses,[49] etc.,
which was so high a service, and so grateful to the whole nation, that
he had acknowledgments and public thanks sent him from all the counties;
he died by the rupture of a vein in a vehement speech he made about the
compositions in a Parliament of King James.By his mother's side he was
a Gunson, Treasurer of the Navy in the reigns of Henry VIII., Queen
Mary, and Queen Elizabeth, and, as by his large pedigree appears,
related to divers of the English nobility.Thus ended this honorable
person, after so many changes and tossings to and fro, in the same house
where he was born."Lord teach us so to number our days, that we may
apply our hearts unto wisdom!"[Footnote 49: Notice was taken of this in a previous passage of the
    "Diary."The different counties were bound to supply provisions of
    various kinds, and these were collected by officers called
    purveyors, whose extortions often excited the attention of
    Parliament.]By a special clause in his will, he ordered that his body should be
buried in the churchyard under the southeast window of the chancel,
adjoining to the burying places of his ancestors, since they came out of
Essex into Sayes Court, he being much offended at the novel custom of
burying everyone within the body of the church and chancel; that being a
favor heretofore granted to martyrs and great persons; this excess of
making churches charnel houses being of ill and irreverend example, and
prejudicial to the health of the living, besides the continual
disturbance of the pavement and seats, and several other indecencies.Hall, the pious Bishop of Norwich, would also be so interred, as may
be read in his testament.I went to see Sir Josiah Child's prodigious cost in
planting walnut trees about his seat, and making fish ponds, many miles
in circuit, in Epping Forest, in a barren spot, as oftentimes these
suddenly monied men for the most part seat themselves.He from a
merchant's apprentice, and management of the East India Company's stock,
being arrived to an estate (it is said) of L200,000; and lately married
his daughter to the eldest son of the Duke of Beaufort, late Marquis of
Worcester, with L50,000 portional present, and various expectations.Houblon's, a rich and gentle French merchant, who was
building a house in the Forest, near Sir J. Child's, in a place where
the late Earl of Norwich dwelt some time, and which came from his lady,
the widow of Mr.It will be a pretty villa, about five miles from
Whitechapel.Horneck preach at the Savoy Church,
on Phil.He was a German born, a most pathetic preacher, a person
of a saint-like life, and hath written an excellent treatise on
Consideration.Whistler's, at the Physicians' College,
with Sir Thomas Millington, both learned men; Dr.W. the most facetious
man in nature, and now Censor of the college.I was here consulted where
they should build their library; it is a pity this college is built so
near Newgate Prison, and in so obscure a hole, a fault in placing most
of our public buildings and churches in the city, through the avarice of
some few men, and his Majesty not overruling it, when it was in his
power after the dreadful conflagration.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st March, 1683.Tenison preached at Whitehall on 1 Cor.12; I
esteem him to be one of the most profitable preachers in the Church of
England, being also of a most holy conversation, very learned and
ingenious.The pains he takes and care of his parish will, I fear, wear
him out, which would be an inexpressible loss.Charleton's lecture on the heart in
the Anatomy Theater at the Physicians' College.To London, in order to my passing the following week,
for the celebration of the Easter now approaching, there being in the
Holy Week so many eminent preachers officiating at the Court and other
places.[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th April, 1683.There was in the afternoon, according to
custom, a sermon before the King, at Whitehall; Dr.Sprat preached for
the Bishop of Rochester.I was at the launching of the last of the thirty ships
ordered to be newly built by Act of Parliament, named the "Neptune," a
second rate, one of the goodliest vessels of the whole navy, built by my
kind neighbor, young Mr.Shish, his Majesty's master shipwright of this
dock.I went to Blackheath, to see the new fair, being the
first procured by the Lord Dartmouth.This was the first day, pretended
for the sale of cattle, but I think in truth to enrich the new tavern at
the bowling-green, erected by Snape, his Majesty's farrier, a man full
of projects.There appeared nothing but an innumerable assembly of
drinking people from London, peddlars, etc., and I suppose it too near
London to be of any great use to the country.March was unusually hot and dry, and all April excessively wet.I planted all the out limits of the garden and long walks with
holly.[50]

    5 in diameter, in my now ruined garden, thanks to the Czar of
    Muscovy."--"_Sylva_," book ii.Dined at Sir Gabriel Sylvius's and thence to visit the
Duke of Norfolk, to ask whether he would part with any of his cartoons
and other drawings of Raphael, and the great masters; he told me if he
might sell them all together he would, but that the late Sir Peter Lely
(our famous painter) had gotten some of his best.The person who desired
me to treat for them was Vander Douse, grandson to that great scholar,
contemporary and friend of Joseph Scaliger.Came to dinner and visited me Sir Richard Anderson, of
Pendley, and his lady, with whom I went to London.On my return home from the Royal Society, I found Mr.Wilbraham, a young gentleman of Cheshire.The Lord Dartmouth was elected Master of the Trinity
House; son to George Legge, late Master of the Ordnance, and one of the
grooms of the bedchamber; a great favorite of the Duke's, an active and
understanding gentleman in sea affairs.To our Society, where we received the Count de
Zinzendorp, Ambassador from the Duke of Saxony, a fine young man; we
showed him divers experiments on the magnet, on which subject the
Society were upon.I went to Windsor, dining by the way at Chiswick, at
Sir Stephen Fox's, where I found Sir Robert Howard (that universal
pretender), and Signor Verrio, who brought his draught and designs for
the painting of the staircase of Sir Stephen's new house.That which was new at Windsor since I was last there, and was surprising
to me, was the incomparable fresco painting in St.George's Hall,
representing the legend of St.George, and triumph of the Black Prince,
and his reception by Edward III.; the volto, or roof, not totally
finished; then the Resurrection in the Chapel, where the figure of the
Ascension is, in my opinion, comparable to any paintings of the most
famous Roman masters; the Last Supper, also over the altar.I liked the
contrivance of the unseen organ behind the altar, nor less the
stupendous and beyond all description the incomparable carving of our
Gibbons, who is, without controversy, the greatest master both for
invention and rareness of work, that the world ever had in any age; nor
doubt I at all that he will prove as great a master in the statuary art.Verrio's invention is admirable, his ordnance full and flowing, antique
and heroical; his figures move; and, if the walls hold (which is the
only doubt by reason of the salts which in time and in this moist
climate prejudice), the work will preserve his name to ages.There was now the terrace brought almost round the old castle; the
grass made clean, even, and curiously turfed; the avenues to the new
park, and other walks, planted with elms and limes, and a pretty canal,
and receptacle for fowl; nor less observable and famous is the throwing
so huge a quantity of excellent water to the enormous height of the
castle, for the use of the whole house, by an extraordinary invention of
Sir Samuel Morland.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with the Earls of
Bath, Castlehaven, Lords Viscounts Falconberg, Falkland, Bishop of
London, the Grand Master of Malta, brother to the Duke de Vendome (a
young wild spark), and Mr.After evening prayer, I
walked in the park with my Lord Clarendon, where we fell into discourse
of the Bishop of Salisbury (Dr.Seth Ward), his subtlety, etc.Durell, late Dean of Windsor, being dead, Dr.Turner, one of the Duke's
chaplains was made dean.I visited my Lady Arlington, groom of the stole to her Majesty, who
being hardly set down to supper, word was brought her that the Queen was
going into the park to walk, it being now near eleven at night; the
alarm caused the Countess to rise in all haste, and leave her supper to
us.By this one may take an estimate of the extreme slavery and subjection
that courtiers live in, who had not time to eat and drink at their
pleasure.It put me in mind of Horace's "Mouse," and to bless God for my
own private condition.Here was Monsieur de l'Angle, the famous minister of Charenton, lately
fled from the persecution in France, concerning the deplorable condition
of the Protestants there.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th June, 1683.I was present, and saw and heard the humble submission
and petition of the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen, on behalf of the
city of London, on the _quo warranto_ against their charter which they
delivered to his Majesty in the presence chamber.It was delivered
kneeling, and then the King and Council went into the council chamber,
the mayor and his brethren attending still in the presence chamber.After a short space they were called in, and my Lord Keeper made a
speech to them, exaggerating the disorderly and riotous behavior in the
late election, and polling for Papillon and Du Bois after the Common
hall had been formally dissolved: with other misdemeanors, libels on the
government, etc., by which they had incurred his Majesty's high
displeasure: and that but for this submission, and under such articles
as the King should require their obedience to, he would certainly enter
judgment against them, which hitherto he had suspended.The things
required were as follows: that they should neither elect mayor,
sheriffs, aldermen, recorder, common Serjeant town clerk, coroner, nor
steward of Southwark, without his Majesty's approbation; and that if
they presented any his Majesty did not like, they should proceed in
wonted manner to a second choice; if that was disapproved, his Majesty
to nominate them; and if within five days they thought good to assent to
this, all former miscarriages should be forgotten.And so they tamely
parted with their so ancient privileges after they had dined and been
treated by the King.What
the consequences will prove, time will show.Divers of the old and most
learned lawyers and judges were of opinion that they could not forfeit
their charter, but might be personally punished for their misdemeanors;
but the plurality of the younger judges and rising men judged it
otherwise.The Popish Plot also, which had hitherto made such a noise, began now
sensibly to dwindle, through the folly, knavery, impudence, and
giddiness of Oates, so as the <DW7>s began to hold up their heads
higher than ever, and those who had fled, flocked to London from abroad.Such sudden changes and eager doings there had been without anything
steady or prudent, for these last seven years.I returned to town in a coach with the Earl of
Clarendon, when passing by the glorious palace of his father, built but
a few years before, which they were now demolishing, being sold to
certain undertakers, I turned my head the contrary way till the coach
had gone past it, lest I might minister occasion of speaking of it;
which must needs have grieved him, that in so short a time their pomp
was fallen.After the Popish Plot, there was now a new and (as
they called it) a Protestant Plot discovered, that certain Lords and
others should design the assassination of the King and the Duke as they
were to come from Newmarket, with a general rising of the nation, and
especially of the city of London, disaffected to the present Government.Upon which were committed to the Tower, the Lord Russell, eldest son of
the Earl of Bedford, the Earl of Essex, Mr.Algernon Sidney, son to the
old Earl of Leicester, Mr.Trenchard, Hampden, Lord Howard of Escrick,
and others.A proclamation was issued against my Lord Grey, the Duke of
Monmouth, Sir Thomas Armstrong, and one Ferguson, who had escaped beyond
sea; of these some were said to be for killing the King, others for only
seizing on him, and persuading him to new counsels, on the pretense of
the danger of Popery, should the Duke live to succeed, who was now again
admitted to the councils and cabinet secrets.The Lords Essex and
Russell were much deplored, for believing they had any evil intention
against the King, or the Church; some thought they were cunningly drawn
in by their enemies for not approving some late counsels and management
relating to France, to Popery, to the persecution of the Dissenters,
etc.They were discovered by the Lord Howard of Escrick and some false
brethren of the club, and the design happily broken; had it taken
effect, it would, to all appearance, have exposed the Government to
unknown and dangerous events; which God avert!Was born my granddaughter at Sayes Court, and christened by the name of
Martha Maria, our Vicar officiating.I pray God bless her, and may she
choose the better part![Sidenote: LONDON]

13th July, 1683.As I was visiting Sir Thomas Yarborough and his Lady,
in Covent Garden, the astonishing news was brought to us of the Earl of
Essex having cut his throat, having been but three days a prisoner in
the Tower, and this happened on the very day and instant that Lord
Russell was on his trial, and had sentence of death.This accident
exceedingly amazed me, my Lord Essex being so well known by me to be a
person of such sober and religious deportment, so well at his ease, and
so much obliged to the King.It is certain the King and Duke were at the
Tower, and passed by his window about the same time this morning, when
my Lord asking for a razor, shut himself into a closet, and perpetrated
the horrid act.Yet it was wondered by some how it was possible he
should do it in the manner he was found, for the wound was so deep and
wide, that being cut through the gullet, windpipe, and both the
jugulars, it reached to the very vertebrae of the neck, so that the head
held to it by a very little skin as it were; the gapping too of the
razor, and cutting his own fingers, was a little strange; but more, that
having passed the jugulars he should have strength to proceed so far,
that an executioner could hardly have done more with an ax.The fatal news coming to Hicks's Hall upon the article of my Lord
Russell's trial, was said to have had no little influence on the Jury
and all the Bench to his prejudice.Others said that he had himself on
some occasions hinted that in case he should be in danger of having his
life taken from him by any public misfortune, those who thirsted for his
estate should miss of their aim; and that he should speak favorably of
that Earl of Northumberland,[51] and some others, who made away with
themselves; but these are discourses so unlike his sober and prudent
conversation that I have no inclination to credit them.What might
instigate him to this devilish act, I am not able to conjecture.My Lord
Clarendon, his brother-in-law, who was with him but the day before,
assured me he was then very cheerful, and declared it to be the effect
of his innocence and loyalty; and most believe that his Majesty had no
severe intentions against him, though he was altogether inexorable as to
Lord Russell and some of the rest.For my part, I believe the crafty and
ambitious Earl of Shaftesbury had brought them into some dislike of the
present carriage of matters at Court, not with any design of destroying
the monarchy (which Shaftesbury had in confidence and for unanswerable
reasons told me he would support to his last breath, as having seen and
felt the misery of being under mechanic tyranny), but perhaps of setting
up some other whom he might govern, and frame to his own platonic fancy,
without much regard to the religion established under the hierarchy, for
which he had no esteem; but when he perceived those whom he had engaged
to rise, fail of his expectations, and the day past, reproaching his
accomplices that a second day for an exploit of this nature was never
successful, he gave them the slip, and got into Holland, where the fox
died, three months before these unhappy Lords and others were discovered
or suspected.Every one deplored Essex and Russell, especially the last,
as being thought to have been drawn in on pretense only of endeavoring
to rescue the King from his present councilors, and secure religion from
Popery, and the nation from arbitrary government, now so much
apprehended; while the rest of those who were fled, especially Ferguson
and his gang, had doubtless some bloody design to get up a Commonwealth,
and turn all things topsy-turvy.Of the same tragical principles is
Sydney.[Footnote 51: Henry Percy, eighth Earl of Northumberland, shot
    himself in the Tower, to which he had been committed on a charge of
    high treason in June, 1585.]I had this day much discourse with Monsieur Pontaq, son to the famous
and wise prime President of Bordeaux.This gentleman was owner of that
excellent _vignoble_ of Pontaq and O'Brien, from whence come the
choicest of our Bordeaux wines; and I think I may truly say of him, what
was not so truly said of St.Paul, that much learning had made him mad.He had studied well in philosophy, but chiefly the Rabbins, and was
exceedingly addicted to cabalistical fancies, an eternal hablador
[romancer], and half distracted by reading abundance of the extravagant
Eastern Jews.He spoke all languages, was very rich, had a handsome
person, and was well bred, about forty-five years of age.Fraser, a learned Scotch gentleman, whom
I had formerly recommended to Lord Berkeley for the instruction and
government of his son, since dead at sea.He had now been in Holland at
the sale of the learned Heinsius's library, and showed me some very rare
and curious books, and some MSS., which he had purchased to good value.There were three or four Herbals in miniature, accurately done, divers
Roman antiquities of Verona, and very many books of Aldus's impression.A stranger, an old man, preached on Jerem.8, the
not hearkening to instruction, portentous of desolation to a people;
much after Bishop Andrew's method, full of logical divisions, in short
and broken periods, and Latin sentences, now quite out of fashion in the
pulpit, which is grown into a far more profitable way, of plain and
practical discourses, of which sort this nation, or any other, never had
greater plenty or more profitable (I am confident); so much has it to
answer for thriving no better on it.The public was now in great consternation on the late plot and
conspiracy; his Majesty very melancholy, and not stirring without double
guards; all the avenues and private doors about Whitehall and the Park
shut up, few admitted to walk in it.The <DW7>s, in the meantime, very
jocund; and indeed with reason, seeing their own plot brought to
nothing, and turned to ridicule, and now a conspiracy of Protestants, as
they called them.The Turks were likewise in hostility against the German Emperor, almost
masters of the Upper Hungary, and drawing toward Vienna.On the other
side, the French King (who it is believed brought in the infidels)
disturbing his Spanish and Dutch neighbors, having swallowed up almost
all Flanders, pursuing his ambition of a fifth universal monarchy; and
all this blood and disorder in Christendom had evidently its rise from
our defections at home, in a wanton peace, minding nothing but luxury,
ambition, and to procure money for our vices.To this add our irreligion
and atheism, great ingratitude, and self-interest; the apostacy of some,
and the suffering the French to grow so great, and the Hollanders so
weak.In a word, we were wanton, mad, and surfeiting with prosperity;
every moment unsettling the old foundations, and never constant to
anything.The Lord in mercy avert the sad omen, and that we do not
provoke him till he bear it no longer!This summer did we suffer twenty French men-of-war to pass our Channel
toward the Sound, to help the Danes against the Swedes, who had
abandoned the French interest, we not having ready sufficient to guard
our coasts, or take cognizance of what they did; though the nation never
had more, or a better navy, yet the sea had never so slender a fleet.George, Prince of Denmark, who had landed this day,
came to marry the Lady Anne, daughter to the Duke; so I returned home,
having seen the young gallant at dinner at Whitehall.Several of the conspirators of the lower form were
executed at Tyburn; and the next day,

[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st July, 1683.Lord Russell was beheaded in Lincoln's Inn Fields, the
executioner giving him three butcherly strokes.The speech he made, and
the paper which he gave the Sheriff declaring his innocence, the
nobleness of the family, the piety and worthiness of the unhappy
gentleman, wrought much pity, and occasioned various discourses on the
plot.I again saw Prince George of Denmark: he had the Danish
countenance, blonde, of few words, spoke French but ill, seemed somewhat
heavy, but reported to be valiant, and indeed he had bravely rescued and
brought off his brother, the King of Denmark, in a battle against the
Swedes, when both these Kings were engaged very smartly.He was married to the Lady Anne at Whitehall.Her Court
and household to be modeled as the Duke's, her father, had been, and

cousin-german of the late Lord Russell, came to visit me, and condole
his sad fate.The next day, came Colonel Russell, uncle to the late Lord
Russell, and brother to the Earl of Bedford, and with him Mrs.Middleton, that famous and indeed incomparable beauty, daughter to my
relation, Sir Robert Needham.I went to Bromley to visit our Bishop, and excellent
neighbor, and to congratulate his now being made Archbishop of York.On
the 28th, he came to take his leave of us, now preparing for his journey
and residence in his province.My sweet little grandchild, Martha Maria, died, and
on the 29th was buried in the parish church.This morning, was read in the church, after the
office was done, the Declaration setting forth the late conspiracy
against the King's person.I went to see what had been done by the Duke of
Beaufort on his lately purchased house at Chelsea, which I once had the
selling of for the Countess of Bristol, he had made great alterations,
but might have built a better house with the materials and the cost he
had been at.Saw the Countess of Monte Feltre, whose husband I had formerly known,
he was a subject of the Pope's, but becoming a Protestant he resided in
England, and married into the family of the Savilles, of Yorkshire.The
Count, her late husband, was a very learned gentleman, a great
politician, and a goodly man.She was accompanied by her sister,
exceedingly skilled in painting, nor did they spare for color on their
own faces.It being the day of public thanksgiving for his
Majesty's late preservation, the former Declaration was again read, and
there was an office used, composed for the occasion.A loyal sermon was
preached on the divine right of Kings, from Psalm cxliv."Thou hast
preserved David from the peril of the sword."Came to visit me the learned anatomist, Dr.Tyson,[52] with some other Fellows of our Society.[Footnote 52: Doctor Edward Tyson, a learned physician, born at
    Clevedon, Somersetshire, in 1649, who became reader of the
    anatomical lecture in Surgeons' Hall, and physician to the hospitals
    of Bethlehem and Bridewell, which offices he held at his death, Aug.He was an ingenious writer, and has left various Essays in
    the Philosophical Transactions and Hook's Collections.He published
    also "The Anatomy of a Porpoise Dissected at Gresham College," and
    "The Anatomy of a Pigmy Compared with a Monkey, an Ape, and a Man,"
    4to., 1698-99.]At the elegant villa and garden of Mr.He showed me the zinnar tree, or platanus, and told me that since
they had planted this kind of tree about the city of Ispahan, in Persia,
the plague, which formerly much infested the place, had exceedingly
abated of its mortal effects, and rendered it very healthy.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th September, 1683.I went to London to visit the Duchess of Grafton,
now great with child, a most virtuous and beautiful lady.Dining with
her at my Lord Chamberlain's, met my Lord of St.Alban's, now grown so
blind, that he could not see to take his meat.He has lived a most easy
life, in plenty even abroad, while his Majesty was a sufferer; he has
lost immense sums at play, which yet, at about eighty years old, he
continues, having one that sits by him to name the spots on the cards.He is a prudent old
courtier, and much enriched since his Majesty's return.After dinner, I walked to survey the sad demolition of Clarendon House,
that costly and only sumptuous palace of the late Lord Chancellor Hyde,
where I have often been so cheerful with him, and sometimes so sad:
happening to make him a visit but the day before he fled from the angry
Parliament, accusing him of maladministration, and being envious at his
grandeur, who from a private lawyer came to be father-in-law to the Duke
of York, and as some would suggest, designing his Majesty's marriage
with the Infanta of Portugal, not apt to breed.To this they imputed
much of our unhappiness; and that he, being sole minister and favorite
at his Majesty's restoration, neglected to gratify the King's suffering
party, preferring those who were the cause of our troubles.But perhaps
as many of these things were injuriously laid to his charge, so he kept
the government far steadier than it has proved since.I could name some
who I think contributed greatly to his ruin,--the buffoons and the
MISSIS, to whom he was an eye-sore.It is true he was of a jolly temper,
after the old English fashion; but France had now the ascendant, and we
were become quite another nation.The Chancellor gone, and dying in
exile, the Earl his successor sold that which cost L50,000 building, to
the young Duke of Albemarle for L25,000, to pay debts which how
contracted remains yet a mystery, his son being no way a prodigal.Some
imagine the Duchess his daughter had been chargeable to him.However it
were, this stately palace is decreed to ruin, to support the prodigious
waste the Duke of Albemarle had made of his estate, since the old man
died.He sold it to the highest bidder, and it fell to certain rich
bankers and mechanics, who gave for it and the ground about it, L35,000;
they design a new town, as it were, and a most magnificent piazza
[square].It is said they have already materials toward it with what
they sold of the house alone, more worth than what they paid for it.See
the vicissitudes of earthly things!I was astonished at this demolition,
nor less at the little army of laborers and artificers leveling the
ground, laying foundations, and contriving great buildings at an expense
of L200,000, if they perfect their design.In my walks I stepped into a goldbeater's
workhouse, where he showed me the wonderful ductility of that spreading
and oily metal.He said it must be finer than the standard, such as was
old angel-gold, and that of such he had once to the value of L100
stamped with the _agnus dei_, and coined at the time of the holy war;
which had been found in a ruined wall somewhere in the North, near to
Scotland, some of which he beat into leaves, and the rest sold to the
curiosi in antiquities and medals.We had now the welcome tidings of the King of
Poland raising the siege of Vienna, which had given terror to all
Europe, and utmost reproach to the French, who it is believed brought in
the Turks for diversion, that the French King might the more easily
swallow Flanders, and pursue his unjust conquest on the empire, while we
sat unconcerned and under a deadly charm from somebody.There was this day a collection for rebuilding Newmarket, consumed by an
accidental fire, which removing his Majesty thence sooner than was
intended, put by the assassins, who were disappointed of their
rendezvous and expectation by a wonderful providence.This made the King
more earnest to render Winchester the seat of his autumnal field
diversions for the future, designing a palace there, where the ancient
castle stood; infinitely indeed preferable to Newmarket for prospects,
air, pleasure, and provisions.The surveyor has already begun the
foundation for a palace, estimated to cost L35,000, and his Majesty is
purchasing ground about it to make a park, etc.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th October, 1683.I went to London, on receiving a note from the
Countess of Arlington, of some considerable charge or advantage I might
obtain by applying myself to his Majesty on this signal conjuncture of
his Majesty entering up judgment against the city charter; the proposal
made me I wholly declined, not being well satisfied with these violent
transactions, and not a little sorry that his Majesty was so often put
upon things of this nature against so great a city, the consequence
whereof may be so much to his prejudice; so I returned home.At this
time, the Lord Chief-Justice Pemberton was displaced.He was held to be
the most learned of the judges, and an honest man.Sir George Jeffreys
was advanced, reputed to be most ignorant, but most daring.Sir George
Treby, Recorder of London, was also put by, and one Genner, an obscure
lawyer, set in his place.Eight of the richest and chief aldermen were
removed and all the rest made only justices of the peace, and no more
wearing of gowns, or chains of gold; the Lord Mayor and two sheriffs
holding their places by new grants as _custodes_, at the King's
pleasure.The pomp and grandeur of the most august city in the world
thus changed face in a moment; which gave great occasion of discourse
and thoughts of hearts, what all this would end in.Prudent men were for
the old foundations.Following his Majesty this morning through the gallery, I went with the
few who attended him, into the Duchess of Portmouth's DRESSING ROOM
within her bedchamber, where she was in her morning loose garment, her
maids combing her, newly out of her bed, his Majesty and the gallants
standing about her; but that which engaged my curiosity, was the rich
and splendid furniture of this woman's apartment, now twice or thrice
pulled down and rebuilt to satisfy her prodigal and expensive pleasures,
while her Majesty's does not exceed some gentlemen's ladies in furniture
and accommodation.Here I saw the new fabric of French tapestry, for
design, tenderness of work, and incomparable imitation of the best
paintings, beyond anything I had ever beheld.Some pieces had
Versailles, St.Germains, and other palaces of the French King, with
huntings, figures, and landscapes, exotic fowls, and all to the life
rarely done.Then for Japan cabinets, screens, pendule clocks, great
vases of wrought plate, tables, stands, chimney-furniture, sconces,
branches, braseras, etc., all of massy silver and out of number, besides
some of her Majesty's best paintings.Surfeiting of this, I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's and went contented home
to my poor, but quiet villa.What contentment can there be in the riches
and splendor of this world, purchased with vice and dishonor?Visited the Duchess of Grafton, not yet brought to
bed, and dining with my Lord Chamberlain (her father), went with them to
see Montague House, a palace lately built by Lord Montague, who had
married the most beautiful Countess of Northumberland.It is a stately
and ample palace.Signor Verrio's fresco paintings, especially the
funeral pile of Dido, on the staircase, the labors of Hercules, fight
with the Centaurs, his effeminacy with Dejanira, and Apotheosis or
reception among the gods, on the walls and roof of the great room
above,--I think exceeds anything he has yet done, both for design,
coloring, and exuberance of invention, comparable to the greatest of the
old masters, or what they so celebrate at Rome.In the rest of the
chamber are some excellent paintings of Holbein, and other masters.The
garden is large, and in good air, but the fronts of the house not
answerable to the inside.The court at entry, and wings for offices seem
too near the street, and that so very narrow and meanly built, that the
corridor is not in proportion to the rest, to hide the court from being
overlooked by neighbors; all which might have been prevented, had they
placed the house further into the ground, of which there was enough to
spare.But on the whole it is a fine palace, built after the French
pavilion-way, by Mr.Hooke, the Curator of the Royal Society.There were
with us my Lady Scroope, the great wit, and Monsieur Chardine, the
celebrated traveler.Came to visit me my old and worthy friend, Mr.Packer, bringing with him his nephew Berkeley, grandson to the honest
judge.A most ingenious, virtuous, and religious gentleman, seated near
Worcester, and very curious in gardening.I was at the court-leet of this manor, my Lord
Arlington his Majesty's High Steward.Came to visit and dine with me, Mr.Brisbane,
Secretary to the Admiralty, a learned and agreeable man.I went to Kew to visit Sir Henry Capell, brother to
the late Earl of Essex; but he being gone to Cashiobury, after I had
seen his garden and the alterations therein, I returned home.He had
repaired his house, roofed his hall with a kind of cupola, and in a
niche was an artificial fountain; but the room seems to me
over-melancholy, yet might be much improved by having the walls well
painted _a fresco_.The two green houses for oranges and myrtles,
communicating with the rooms below, are very well contrived.There is a
cupola made with pole-work between two elms at the end of a walk, which
being covered by plashing the trees to them, is very pretty; for the
rest there are too many fir trees in the garden.[Sidenote: LONDON]

17th November, 1683.I took a house in Villiers Street, York Buildings,
for the winter, having many important concerns to dispatch, and for the
education of my daughters.The Duke of Monmouth, till now proclaimed traitor on
the pretended plot for which Lord Russell was lately beheaded, came this
evening to Whitehall and rendered himself, on which were various
discourses.I went to compliment the Duchess of Grafton, now
lying-in of her first child, a son, which she called for, that I might
see it.She was become more beautiful, if it were possible, than before,
and full of virtue and sweetness.She discoursed with me of many
particulars, with great prudence and gravity beyond her years.Forbes showed me the plot of the garden making
at Burleigh, at my Lord Exeter's, which I looked on as one of the most
noble that I had seen.The whole court and town in solemn mourning for the death of the King of
Portugal, her Majesty's brother.At the anniversary dinner of the Royal Society the
King sent us two does.I was this day invited to a wedding of one Mrs.Castle, to whom I had some obligation, and it was to her fifth husband,
a lieutenant-colonel of the city.She was the daughter of one Burton, a
broom-man, by his wife, who sold kitchen stuff in Kent Street, whom God
so blessed that the father became a very rich, and was a very honest
man; he was sheriff of Surrey, where I have sat on the bench with him.Another of his daughters was married to Sir John Bowles; and this
daughter was a jolly friendly woman.There was at the wedding the Lord
Mayor, the Sheriff, several Aldermen and persons of quality; above all,
Sir George Jeffreys, newly made Lord Chief Justice of England, with Mr.Justice Withings, danced with the bride, and were exceedingly merry.These great men spent the rest of the afternoon, till eleven at night,
in drinking healths, taking tobacco, and talking much beneath the
gravity of judges, who had but a day or two before condemned Mr.Algernon Sidney, who was executed the 7th on Tower Hill, on the single
witness of that monster of a man, Lord Howard of Escrick, and some
sheets of paper taken in Mr.Sidney's study, pretended to be written by
him, but not fully proved, nor the time when, but appearing to have been
written before his Majesty's Restoration, and then pardoned by the Act
of Oblivion; so that though Mr.Sidney was known to be a person
obstinately averse to government by a monarch (the subject of the paper
was in answer to one by Sir E. Filmer), yet it was thought he had very
hard measure.There is this yet observable, that he had been an
inveterate enemy to the last king, and in actual rebellion against him;
a man of great courage, great sense, great parts, which he showed both
at his trial and death; for, when he came on the scaffold, instead of a
speech, he told them only that he had made his peace with God, that he
came not thither to talk, but to die; put a paper into the sheriff's
hand, and another into a friend's; said one prayer as short as a grace,
laid down his neck, and bid the executioner do his office.The Duke of Monmouth, now having his pardon, refuses to acknowledge
there was any treasonable plot; for which he is banished Whitehall.This
is a great disappointment to some who had prosecuted Trenchard, Hampden,
etc., that for want of a second witness were come out of the Tower upon
their _habeas corpus_.The King had now augmented his guards with a new sort of dragoons, who
carried also grenades, and were habited after the Polish manner, with
long peaked caps, very fierce and fantastical.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th December, 1683.I went to the Tower, and visited the Earl of Danby,
the late Lord High Treasurer, who had been imprisoned four years: he
received me with great kindness.I dined with him, and stayed till
night.We had discourse of many things, his Lady railing sufficiently at
the keeping her husband so long in prison.Here I saluted the Lord
Dumblaine's wife, who before had been married to Emerton, and about whom
there was that scandalous business before the delegates.The smallpox very prevalent and mortal; the Thames
frozen.I dined at Lord Clarendon's, where I was to meet
that ingenious and learned gentleman, Sir George Wheeler, who has
published the excellent description of Africa and Greece, and who, being
a knight of a very fair estate and young, had now newly entered into
holy orders.I went to visit Sir John Chardin, a French
gentleman, who traveled three times by land into Persia, and had made
many curious researches in his travels, of which he was now setting
forth a relation.It being in England this year one of the severest
frosts that has happened of many years, he told me the cold in Persia
was much greater, the ice of an incredible thickness; that they had
little use of iron in all that country, it being so moist (though the
air admirably clear and healthy) that oil would not preserve it from
rusting, so that they had neither clocks nor watches; some padlocks they
had for doors and boxes.Sprat, now made Dean of Westminster, preached
to the King at Whitehall, on Matt.Recollecting the passages of
the past year, I gave God thanks for his mercies, praying his blessing
for the future.The weather continuing intolerably severe, streets
of booths were set up on the Thames; the air was so very cold and thick,
as of many years there had not been the like.I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's: after dinner came a
fellow who ate live charcoal, glowingly ignited, quenching them in his
mouth, and then champing and swallowing them down.There was a dog also
which seemed to do many rational actions.I went across the Thames on the ice, now become so
thick as to bear not only streets of booths, in which they roasted meat,
and had divers shops of wares, quite across as in a town, but coaches,
carts, and horses passed over.So I went from Westminster stairs to
Lambeth, and dined with the Archbishop: where I met my Lord Bruce, Sir
George Wheeler, Colonel Cooke, and several divines.After dinner and
discourse with his Grace till evening prayers, Sir George Wheeler and I
walked over the ice from Lambeth stairs to the Horse-ferry.I visited Sir Robert Reading, where after supper we
had music, but not comparable to that which Mrs.Bridgeman made us on
the guitar with such extraordinary skill and dexterity.The Thames was filled with people and tents selling
all sorts of wares as in the city.The frost continues more and more severe, the Thames
before London was still planted with booths in formal streets, all sorts
of trades and shops furnished, and full of commodities, even to a
printing press, where the people and ladies took a fancy to have their
names printed, and the day and year set down when printed on the Thames:
this humor took so universally, that it was estimated that the printer
gained L5 a day, for printing a line only, at sixpence a name, besides
what he got by ballads, etc.Coaches plied from Westminster to the
Temple, and from several other stairs to and fro, as in the streets,
sleds, sliding with skates, a bull-baiting, horse and coach-races,
puppet-plays and interludes, cooks, tippling, and other lewd places, so
that it seemed to be a bacchanalian triumph, or carnival on the water,
while it was a severe judgment on the land, the trees not only splitting
as if the lightning struck, but men and cattle perishing in divers
places, and the very seas so locked up with ice, that no vessels could
stir out or come in.The fowls, fish, and birds, and all our exotic
plants and greens, universally perishing.Many parks of deer were
destroyed, and all sorts of fuel so dear, that there were great
contributions to preserve the poor alive.Nor was this severe weather
much less intense in most parts of Europe, even as far as Spain and the
most southern tracts.London, by reason of the excessive coldness of the
air hindering the ascent of the smoke, was so filled with the fuliginous
steam of the sea-coal, that hardly could one see across the street, and
this filling the lungs with its gross particles, exceedingly obstructed
the breast, so as one could scarcely breathe.Here was no water to be
had from the pipes and engines, nor could the brewers and divers other
tradesmen work, and every moment was full of disastrous accidents.I went to Sayes Court to see how the frost had
dealt with my garden, where I found many of the greens and rare plants
utterly destroyed.The oranges and myrtles very sick, the rosemary and
laurels dead to all appearance, but the cypress likely to endure it.It began to thaw, but froze again.My coach crossed
from Lambeth, to the Horse-ferry at Milbank, Westminster.The booths
were almost all taken down; but there was first a map or landscape cut
in copper representing all the manner of the camp, and the several
actions, sports, and pastimes thereon, in memory of so signal a frost.I dined with my Lord Keeper, [North], and walking
alone with him some time in his gallery, we had discourse of music.He
told me he had been brought up to it from a child, so as to sing his
part at first sight.Then speaking of painting, of which he was also a
great lover, and other ingenious matters, he desired me to come oftener
to him.I went this evening to visit that great and knowing
virtuoso, Monsieur Justell.The weather was set in to an absolute thaw
and rain; but the Thames still frozen.After eight weeks missing the foreign posts, there
came abundance of intelligence from abroad.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th February, 1684.The Earl of Danby, late Lord-Treasurer, together
with the Roman Catholic Lords impeached of high treason in the Popish
Plot, had now their _habeas corpus_, and came out upon bail, after five
years' imprisonment in the Tower.Then were also tried and deeply fined
Mr.Hampden and others, for being supposed of the late plot, for which
Lord Russell and Colonel Sidney suffered; as also the person who went
about to prove that the Earl of Essex had his throat cut in the Tower by
others; likewise Mr.Johnson, the author of that famous piece called
Julian.News of the Prince of Orange having accused the
Deputies of Amsterdam of _crimen laesae Majestatis_, and being pensioners
to France.Tenison communicated to me his intention of erecting a library in
St.Martin's parish, for the public use, and desired my assistance, with
Sir Christopher Wren, about the placing and structure thereof, a worthy
and laudable design.He told me there were thirty or forty young men in
Orders in his parish, either governors to young gentlemen or chaplains
to noblemen, who being reproved by him on occasion for frequenting
taverns or coffeehouses, told him they would study or employ their time
better, if they had books.This put the pious Doctor on this design; and
indeed a great reproach it is that so great a city as London should not
have a public library becoming it.Paul's;
the west end of that church (if ever finished) would be a convenient
place.I went to Sir John Chardin, who desired my
assistance for the engraving the plates, the translation, and printing
his History of that wonderful Persian Monument near Persepolis, and
other rare antiquities, which he had caused to be drawn from the
originals in his second journey into Persia, which we now concluded
upon.Afterward, I went with Sir Christopher Wren to Dr.Tenison, where
we made the drawing and estimate of the expense of the library, to be
begun this next spring near the Mews.Great expectation of the Prince of Orange's attempts in Holland to bring
those of Amsterdam to consent to the new levies, to which we were no
friends, by a pseudo-politic adherence to the French interest.Turner, our new Bishop of
Rochester.I dined at Lady Tuke's, where I heard Dr.Walgrave
(physician to the Duke and Duchess) play excellently on the lute.Meggot, Dean of Winchester, preached an
incomparable sermon (the King being now gone to Newmarket), on Heb.15, showing and pathetically pressing the care we ought to have lest we
come short of the grace of God.Tenison
at Kensington, whither he was retired to refresh, after he had been sick
of the smallpox.Henry Godolphin, a prebend
of St.Paul's, and brother to my dear friend Sydney, on Isaiah 1v.I
dined at the Lord Keeper's, and brought him to Sir John Chardin, who
showed him his accurate drafts of his travels in Persia.There was so great a concourse of people with their
children to be touched for the Evil, that six or seven were crushed to
death by pressing at the chirurgeon's door for tickets.The weather
began to be more mild and tolerable; but there was not the least
appearance of any spring.The Bishop of Rochester preached before
the King; after which his Majesty, accompanied with three of his natural
sons, the Dukes of Northumberland, Richmond, and St.Alban (sons of
Portsmouth, Cleveland, and Nelly), went up to the altar; the three boys
entering before the King within the rails, at the right hand, and three
bishops on the left: London (who officiated), Durham, and Rochester,
with the subdean, Dr.The King, kneeling before the altar,
making his offering, the Bishops first received, and then his Majesty;
after which he retired to a canopied seat on the right hand.Note, there
was perfume burned before the office began.I had received the Sacrament
at Whitehall early with the Lords and household, the Bishop of London
officiating.Tenison preached
(recovered from the smallpox); then went again to Whitehall as above.I returned home with my family to my house at Sayes
Court, after five months' residence in London; hardly the least
appearance of any spring.A letter of mine to the Royal Society concerning the
terrible effects of the past winter being read, they desired it might be
printed in the next part of their "Transactions."[Sidenote: SURREY]

10th May, 1684.Called by the way
at Ashted, where Sir Robert Howard (Auditor of the Exchequer)
entertained me very civilly at his newly-built house, which stands in a
park on the Down, the avenue south; though down hill to the house, which
is not great, but with the outhouses very convenient.The staircase is
painted by Verrio with the story of Astrea; among other figures is the
picture of the painter himself, and not unlike him; the rest is well
done, only the columns did not at all please me; there is also Sir
Robert's own picture in an oval; the whole in _fresco_.The place has
this great defect, that there is no water but what is drawn up by horses
from a very deep well.Higham, who was ill, and died three days
after.His grandfather and father (who christened me), with himself, had
now been rectors of this parish 101 years, viz, from May, 1583.I returned to London, where I found the Commissioners of
the Admiralty abolished, and the office of Admiral restored to the Duke,
as to the disposing and ordering all sea business; but his Majesty
signed all petitions, papers, warrants, and commissions, that the Duke,
not acting as admiral by commission or office, might not incur the
penalty of the late Act against <DW7>s and Dissenters holding offices,
and refusing the oath and test.Every one was glad of this change, those
in the late Commission being utterly ignorant in their duty, to the
great damage of the Navy.The utter ruin of the Low Country was threatened by the siege of
Luxemburg, if not timely relieved, and by the obstinacy of the
Hollanders, who refused to assist the Prince of Orange, being corrupted
by the French.I received L600 of Sir Charles Bickerstaff for the fee
farm of Pilton, in Devon.Lord Dartmouth was chosen Master of the Trinity Company,
newly returned with the fleet from blowing up and demolishing Tangier.In the sermon preached on this occasion, Dr.Can observed that, in the
27th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, the casting anchor out of the
fore ship had been caviled at as betraying total ignorance: that it is
very true our seamen do not do so; but in the Mediterranean their ships
were built differently from ours, and to this day it was the practice to
do so there.Luxemburg was surrendered to the French, which makes them master of all
the Netherlands, gives them entrance into Germany, and a fair game for
universal monarchy; which that we should suffer, who only and easily
might have hindered, astonished all the world.Thus is the poor Prince
of Orange ruined, and this nation and all the Protestant interest in
Europe following, unless God in his infinite mercy, as by a miracle,
interpose, and our great ones alter their counsels.The French fleet
were now besieging Genoa, but after burning much of that beautiful city
with their bombs, went off with disgrace.My cousin, Verney, to whom a very great fortune was
fallen, came to take leave of us, going into the country; a very worthy
and virtuous young gentleman.I went to advise and give directions about the building
of two streets in Berkeley Garden, reserving the house and as much of
the garden as the breadth of the house.In the meantime, I could not but
deplore that sweet place (by far the most noble gardens, courts, and
accommodations, stately porticos, etc., anywhere about the town) should
be so much straitened and turned into tenements.But that magnificent
pile and gardens contiguous to it, built by the late Lord Chancellor
Clarendon, being all demolished, and designed for piazzas and buildings,
was some excuse for my Lady Berkeley's resolution of letting out her
ground also for so excessive a price as was offered, advancing near
L1,000 per annum in mere ground rents; to such a mad intemperance was
the age come of building about a city, by far too disproportionate
already to the nation:[53] I having in my time seen it almost as large
again as it was within my memory.[Footnote 53: What would Evelyn think if he could see what is now
    called London?]Last Friday, Sir Thomas Armstrong was executed at Tyburn
for treason, without trial, having been outlawed and apprehended in
Holland, on the conspiracy of the Duke of Monmouth, Lord Russell, etc.,
which gave occasion of discourse to people and lawyers, in regard it was
on an outlawry that judgment was given and execution.[54]

    [Footnote 54: When brought up for judgment, Armstrong insisted on
    his right to a trial, the act giving that right to those who came in
    within a year, and the year not having expired.Jefferies refused
    it; and when Armstrong insisted that he asked nothing but law,
    Jefferies told him he should have it to the full, and ordered his
    execution in six days.When Jefferies went to the King at Windsor
    soon after, the King took a ring from his finger and gave it to
    Jefferies.[Sidenote: GREENWICH]

2d July, 1684.I went to the Observatory at Greenwich, where Mr.Flamsted took his observations of the eclipse of the sun, now almost
three parts obscured.There had been an excessively hot and dry spring, and such a drought
still continued as never was in my memory.Some small sprinkling of rain; the leaves dropping
from the trees as in autumn.I dined at Lord Falkland's, Treasurer of the Navy,
where after dinner we had rare music, there being among others, Signor
Pietro Reggio, and Signor John Baptist, both famous, one for his voice,
the other for playing on the harpsichord, few if any in Europe exceeding
him.There was also a Frenchman who sung an admirable bass.I returned home, where I found my Lord Chief Justice
[Jefferies], the Countess of Clarendon, and Lady Catherine Fitzgerald,
who dined with me.We had now rain after such a drought as no man in
England had known.We had not had above one or two
considerable showers, and those storms, these eight or nine months.Many
trees died for the want of refreshment.Sidney Godolphin was made Baron Godolphin.The King being returned from Winchester, there was
a numerous Court at Whitehall.At this time the Earl of Rochester was removed from the Treasury to the
Presidentship of the Council; Lord Godolphin was made first Commissioner
of the Treasury in his place, Lord Middleton (a Scot) made Secretary of
State, in the room of Lord Godolphin.These alterations being very
unexpected and mysterious, gave great occasion of discourse.There was now an Ambassador from the King of Siam, in the East Indies,
to his Majesty.I went with Sir William Godolphin to see the
rhinoceros, or unicorn, being the first that I suppose was ever brought
into England.She belonged to some East India merchants, and was sold
(as I remember) for above L2,000.At the same time, I went to see a
crocodile, brought from some of the West India Islands, resembling the
Egyptian crocodile.I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's with the Duke of
Northumberland.He seemed to be a young gentleman of good capacity, well
bred, civil and modest: newly come from travel, and had made his
campaign at the siege of Luxemburg.Of all his Majesty's children (of
which he had now six Dukes) this seemed the most accomplished and worth
the owning.What the
Dukes of Richmond and St.Alban's will prove, their youth does not yet
discover; they are very pretty boys.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th October, 1684.Goodman preached before the King on James ii.12, concerning the law of liberty: an excellent discourse and in good
method.He is author of "The Prodigal Son," a treatise worth reading,
and another of the old religion.I visited the Lord Chamberlain, where dined the
BLACK BARON and Monsieur Flamerin, who had so long been banished from
France for a duel.I carried Lord Clarendon through the city amid all
the squibs and bacchanalia of the Lord Mayor's show, to the Royal
Society, where he was proposed a member; and then treated him at dinner.Clement's, that prettily built and contrived church where
a young divine gave us an eloquent sermon on 1 Cor.20, inciting to
gratitude and glorifying God for the fabric of our bodies and the
dignity of our nature.A sudden change from temperate warm weather to an
excessive cold rain, frost, snow, and storm, such as had seldom been
known.This winter weather began as early and fierce as the past did
late; till about Christmas there then had been hardly any winter.Turner, now translated from Rochester to Ely
upon the death of Dr.Peter Gunning, preached before the King at
Whitehall on Romans iii.8, a very excellent sermon, vindicating the
Church of England against the pernicious doctrines of the Church of
Rome.He challenged the producing but of five clergymen who forsook our
Church and went over to that of Rome, during all the troubles and
rebellion in England, which lasted near twenty years; and this was to my
certain observation a great truth.Being the Queen's birthday, there were fireworks
on the Thames before Whitehall, with pageants of castles, forts, and
other devices of girandolas, serpents, the King and Queen's arms and
mottoes, all represented in fire, such as had not been seen here.But
the most remarkable was the several fires and skirmishes in the very
water, which actually moved a long way, burning under the water, now and
then appearing above it, giving reports like muskets and cannon, with
grenades and innumerable other devices.It is said it cost L1,500.It
was concluded with a ball, where all the young ladies and gallants
danced in the great hall.The court had not been seen so brave and rich
in apparel since his Majesty's Restoration.Fiennes, son of the Lord Say
and Seale, preached before the King on Joshua xxi.Slingsby (Master of the
Mint), to see Mr.The series of Popes
was rare, and so were several among the moderns, especially that of John
Huss's martyrdom at Constance; of the Roman Emperors, Consulars some
Greek, etc., in copper, gold, and silver; not many truly antique; a
medallion of Otho Paulus Aemilius, etc., ancient.They were held at a
price of L1,000; but not worth, I judge, above L200.I went to see the new church at St.James's,
elegantly built; the altar was especially adorned, the white marble
inclosure curiously and richly carved, the flowers and garlands about
the walls by Mr.Gibbons, in wood: a pelican with her young at her
breast; just over the altar in the carved compartment and border
environing the purple velvet fringed with I. H. S. richly embroidered,
and most noble plate, were given by Sir R. Geere, to the value (as was
said) of L200.There was no altar anywhere in England, nor has there
been any abroad, more handsomely adorned.James's Park
to see three Turkish, or Asian horses, newly brought over, and now first
shown to his Majesty.There were four, but one of them died at sea,
being three weeks coming from Hamburg.They were taken from a Bashaw at
the siege of Vienna, at the late famous raising that leaguer.I never
beheld so delicate a creature as one of them was, of somewhat a bright
bay, two white feet, a blaze; such a head, eyes, ears, neck, breast,
belly, haunches, legs, pasterns, and feet, in all regards, beautiful,
and proportioned to admiration; spirited, proud, nimble, making halt,
turning with that swiftness, and in so small a compass, as was
admirable.With all this so gentle and tractable as called to mind what
I remember Busbequius, speaks of them, to the reproach of our grooms in
Europe, who bring up their horses so churlishly, as makes most of them
retain their ill habits.They trotted like does, as if they did not feel
the ground.Five hundred guineas was demanded for the first; 300 for the
second; and 200 for the third, which was brown.All of them were
choicely shaped, but the two last not altogether so perfect as the
first.It was judged by the spectators, among whom was the King, Prince of
Denmark, Duke of York, and several of the Court, noble persons skilled
in horses, especially Monsieur Faubert and his son (provost masters of
the Academy, and esteemed of the best in Europe), that there were never
seen any horses in these parts to be compared with them.Add to all
this, the furniture consisting of embroidery on the saddle, housings,
quiver, bow, arrows, scymitar, sword, mace, or battle-ax, _a la
Turcisq_; the Bashaw's velvet mantle furred with the most perfect ermine
I ever beheld; all which, ironwork in common furniture being here of
silver, curiously wrought and double gilt to an incredible value.Such
and so extraordinary was the embroidery, that I never saw anything
approaching it.The reins and headstall were of crimson silk, covered
with chains of silver gilt.There was also a Turkish royal standard of a
horse's tail, together with all sorts of other caparisons belonging to a
general's horse, by which one may estimate how gallantly and
magnificently those infidels appear in the field; for nothing could be
seen more glorious.The gentleman (a German) who rode the horse, was in
all this garb.They were shod with iron made round and closed at the
heel, with a hole in the middle about as wide as a shilling.I went with Lord Cornwallis to see the young
gallants do their exercise.Faubert having newly railed in a manage,
and fitted it for the academy.There were the Dukes of Norfolk and
Northumberland, Lord Newburgh, and a nephew of (Duras) Earl of
Feversham.The exercises were, 1, running at the ring; 2, flinging a
javelin at a Moor's head; 3, discharging a pistol at a mark; lastly
taking up a gauntlet with the point of a sword; all these performed in
full speed.The Duke of Northumberland hardly missed of succeeding in
every one, a dozen times, as I think.The Duke of Norfolk did exceeding
bravely.Lords Newburgh and Duras seemed nothing so dexterous.Here I
saw the difference of what the French call "_bel homme a cheval_," and
"_bon homme a cheval_"; the Duke of Norfolk being the first, that is
rather a fine person on a horse, the Duke of Northumberland being both
in perfection, namely, a graceful person and an excellent rider.But the
Duke of Norfolk told me he had not been at this exercise these twelve
years before.There were in the field the Prince of Denmark, and the
Lord Lansdowne, son of the Earl of Bath, who had been made a Count of
the Empire last summer for his service before Vienna.John, a worthy gentleman, on a knight
of quality, in a tavern.So
many horrid murders and duels were committed about this time as were
never before heard of in England; which gave much cause of complaint and
murmurings.It proved so sharp weather, and so long and cruel
a frost, that the Thames was frozen across, but the frost was often
dissolved, and then froze again.5, after
the Presbyterian tedious method and repetition.I dined at Lord Newport's, who had some excellent
pictures, especially that of Sir Thomas Hanmer, by Vandyke, one of the
best he ever painted; another of our English Dobson's painting; but,
above all, Christ in the Virgin's lap, by Poussin, an admirable piece;
with something of most other famous hands.I saw this
evening such a scene of profuse gaming, and the King in the midst of his
three concubines, as I have never before seen--luxurious dallying and
profaneness.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, being invited to hear
that celebrated voice of Mr.Pordage, newly come from Rome; his singing
was after the Venetian recitative, as masterly as could be, and with an
excellent voice both treble and bass; Dr.Walgrave accompanied it with
his THEORBO LUTE, on which he performed beyond imagination, and is
doubtless one of the greatest masters in Europe on that charming
instrument.Pordage is a priest, as Mr.There was in the room where we dined, and in his bedchamber, those
incomparable pieces of Columbus, a Flagellation, the Grammar school, the
Venus and Adonis of Titian; and of Vandyke's that picture of the late
Earl of Digby (father of the Countess of Sunderland), and Earl of
Bedford, Sir Kenelm Digby, and two ladies of incomparable performance;
besides that of Moses and the burning bush of Bassano, and several other
pieces of the best masters.A marble head of M. Brutus, etc.I was invited to my Lord Arundel's, of Wardour (now
newly released of his six years' confinement in the Tower on suspicion
of the plot called Oates's Plot), where after dinner the same Mr.Pordage entertained us with his voice, that excellent and stupendous
artist, Signor John Baptist, playing to it on the harpsichord.My
daughter Mary being with us, she also sang to the great satisfaction of
both the masters, and a world of people of quality present.She did so also at my Lord Rochester's the evening following, where we
had the French boy so famed for his singing, and indeed he had a
delicate voice, and had been well taught.Packer
(daughter to my old friend) sing before his Majesty and the Duke,
privately, that stupendous bass, Gosling, accompanying her, but hers was
so loud as took away much of the sweetness.Certainly never woman had a
stronger or better ear, could she possibly have governed it.She would
do rarely in a large church among the nuns.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th February, 1685.I went to London, hearing his Majesty had been the
Monday before (2d February) surprised in his bedchamber with an
apoplectic fit, so that if, by God's providence, Dr.King (that
excellent chirurgeon as well as physician) had not been accidentally
present to let him bleed (having his lancet in his pocket), his Majesty
had certainly died that moment; which might have been of direful
consequence, there being nobody else present with the King save this
Doctor and one more, as I am assured.It was a mark of the extraordinary
dexterity, resolution, and presence of mind in the Doctor, to let him
bleed in the very paroxysm, without staying the coming of other
physicians, which regularly should have been done, and for want of which
he must have a regular pardon, as they tell me.This rescued his Majesty
for the instant, but it was only a short reprieve.He still complained,
and was relapsing, often fainting, with sometimes epileptic symptoms,
till Wednesday, for which he was cupped, let bleed in both jugulars, and
both vomit and purges, which so relieved him, that on Thursday hopes of
recovery were signified in the public "Gazette," but that day about
noon, the physicians thought him feverish.This they seemed glad of, as
being more easily allayed and methodically dealt with than his former
fits; so as they prescribed the famous Jesuit's powder; but it made him
worse, and some very able doctors who were present did not think it a
fever, but the effect of his frequent bleeding and other sharp
operations used by them about his head, so that probably the powder
might stop the circulation, and renew his former fits, which now made
him very weak.Thus he passed Thursday night with great difficulty, when
complaining of a pain in his side, they drew twelve ounces more of blood
from him; this was by six in the morning on Friday, and it gave him
relief, but it did not continue, for being now in much pain, and
struggling for breath, he lay dozing, and, after some conflicts, the
physicians despairing of him, he gave up the ghost at half an hour after
eleven in the morning, being the sixth of February, 1685, in the 36th
year of his reign, and 54th of his age.Prayers were solemnly made in all the churches, especially in both the
Court Chapels, where the chaplains relieved one another every half
quarter of an hour from the time he began to be in danger till he
expired, according to the form prescribed in the Church offices.Those
who assisted his Majesty's devotions were, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
the Bishops of London, Durham, and Ely, but more especially Dr.Ken, the
Bishop of Bath and Wells.[55] It is said they exceedingly urged the
receiving Holy Sacrament, but his Majesty told them he would consider of
it, which he did so long till it was too late.Others whispered that the
Bishops and Lords, except the Earls of Bath and Feversham, being ordered
to withdraw the night before, Huddleston, the priest, had presumed to
administer the Popish offices.He gave his breeches and keys to the Duke
who was almost continually kneeling by his bedside, and in tears.He
also recommended to him the care of his natural children, all except the
Duke of Monmouth, now in Holland, and in his displeasure.He entreated
the Queen to pardon him (not without cause); who a little before had
sent a Bishop to excuse her not more frequently visiting him, in regard
of her excessive grief, and withal that his Majesty would forgive it if
at any time she had offended him.He spoke to the Duke to be kind to the
Duchess of Cleveland, and especially Portsmouth, and that Nelly might
not starve.[Footnote 55: The account given of this by Charles's brother and
    successor, is, that when the King's life was wholly despaired of,
    and it was time to prepare for another world, two Bishops came to do
    their function, who reading the prayers appointed in the Common
    Prayer Book on that occasion, when they came to the place where
    usually they exhort a sick person to make a confession of his sins,
    the Bishop of Bath and Wells, who was one of them, advertised him,
    IT WAS NOT OF OBLIGATION; and after a short exhortation, asked him
    if he was sorry for his sins?which the King saying he was, the
    Bishop pronounced the absolution, and then, asked him if he pleased
    to receive the Sacrament?to which the King made no reply; and being
    pressed by the Bishop several times, gave no other answer but that
    it was time enough, or that he would think of it.King James adds, that he stood all the while by the bedside, and
    seeing the King would not receive the Sacrament from them, and
    knowing his sentiments, he desired the company to stand a little
    from the bed, and then asked the King whether he should send for a
    priest, to which the King replied: "For God's sake, brother, do, and
    lose no time."The Duke said he would bring one to him; but none
    could be found except Father Huddleston, who had been so assistant
    in the King's escape from Worcester; he was brought up a back
    staircase, and the company were desired to withdraw, but he (the
    Duke of York) not thinking fit that he should be left alone with the
    King, desired the Earl of Bath, a Lord of the Bedchamber, and the
    Earl of Feversham, Captain of the Guard, should stay; the rest being
    gone, Father Huddleston was introduced, and administered the
    Sacrament.--"Life of James II."]Thus died King Charles II., of a vigorous and robust constitution, and
in all appearance promising a long life.He was a prince of many
virtues, and many great imperfections; debonair, easy of access, not
bloody nor cruel; his countenance fierce, his voice great, proper of
person, every motion became him; a lover of the sea, and skillful in
shipping; not affecting other studies, yet he had a laboratory, and knew
of many empirical medicines, and the easier mechanical mathematics; he
loved planting and building, and brought in a politer way of living,
which passed to luxury and intolerable expense.He had a particular
talent in telling a story, and facetious passages, of which he had
innumerable; this made some buffoons and vicious wretches too
presumptuous and familiar, not worthy the favor they abused.He took
delight in having a number of little spaniels follow him and lie in his
bedchamber, where he often suffered the bitches to puppy and give suck,
which rendered it very offensive, and indeed made the whole court nasty
and stinking.He would doubtless have been an excellent prince, had he
been less addicted to women, who made him uneasy, and always in want to
supply their immeasurable profusion, to the detriment of many indigent
persons who had signally served both him and his father.He frequently
and easily changed favorites to his great prejudice.As to other public transactions, and unhappy miscarriages, 'tis not
here I intend to number them; but certainly never had King more glorious
opportunities to have made himself, his people, and all Europe happy,
and prevented innumerable mischiefs, had not his too easy nature
resigned him to be managed by crafty men, and some abandoned and profane
wretches who corrupted his otherwise sufficient parts, disciplined as he
had been by many afflictions during his banishment, which gave him much
experience and knowledge of men and things; but those wicked creatures
took him from off all application becoming so great a King.The history
of his reign will certainly be the most wonderful for the variety of
matter and accidents, above any extant in former ages: the sad tragical
death of his father, his banishment and hardships, his miraculous
restoration, conspiracies against him, parliaments, wars, plagues,
fires, comets, revolutions abroad happening in his time, with a thousand
other particulars.He was ever kind to me, and very gracious upon all
occasions, and therefore I cannot without ingratitude but deplore his
loss, which for many respects, as well as duty, I do with all my soul.His Majesty being dead, the Duke, now King James II., went immediately
to Council, and before entering into any business, passionately
declaring his sorrow, told their Lordships, that since the succession
had fallen to him, he would endeavor to follow the example of his
predecessor in his clemency and tenderness to his people; that, however
he had been misrepresented as affecting arbitrary power, they should
find the contrary; for that the laws of England had made the King as
great a monarch as he could desire; that he would endeavor to maintain
the Government both in Church and State, as by law established, its
principles being so firm for monarchy, and the members of it showing
themselves so good and loyal subjects;[56] and that, as he would never
depart from the just rights and prerogatives of the Crown, so he would
never invade any man's property; but as he had often adventured his life
in defense of the nation, so he would still proceed, and preserve it in
all its lawful rights and liberties.[Footnote 56: This is the substance (and very nearly the words
    employed) of what is stated by King James II.printed in
    his life; but in that MS.For example, after speaking of the members of the Church of England
    as good and loyal subjects, the King adds, "AND THEREFORE I SHALL
    ALWAYS TAKE CARE TO DEFEND AND SUPPORT IT."James then goes on to
    say, that being desired by some present to allow copies to be taken,
    he said he had not committed it to writing; on which Mr.Finch (then
    Solicitor-General and afterward Earl of Aylesford) replied, that
    what his Majesty had said had made so deep an impression on him,
    that he believed he could repeat the very words, and if his Majesty
    would permit him, he would write them down, which the King agreeing
    to, he went to a table and wrote them down, and this being shown to
    the King, he approved of it, and it was immediately published.The
    King afterward proceeds to say: "No one can wonder that Mr.Finch
    should word the speech as strong as he could in favor of the
    Established Religion, nor that the King in such a hurry should pass
    it over without reflection; for though his Majesty intended to
    promise both security to their religion and protection to their
    persons, he was afterward convinced it had been better expressed by
    assuring them he never would endeavor to alter the Established
    Religion, than that he would endeavor to preserve it, and that he
    would rather support and defend the professors of it, than the
    religion itself; they could not expect he should make a conscience
    of supporting what in his conscience he thought erroneous: his
    engaging not to molest the professors of it, nor to deprive them or
    their successors of any spiritual dignity, revenue, or employment,
    but to suffer the ecclesiastical affairs to go on in the track they
    were in, was all they could wish or desire from a Prince of a
    different persuasion; but having once approved that way of
    expressing it which Mr.Finch had made choice of, he thought it
    necessary not to vary from it in the declarations or speeches he
    made afterward, not doubting but the world would understand it in
    the meaning he intended.----'Tis true, afterward IT WAS pretended
    he kept not up to this engagement; but had they deviated no further
    from the duty and allegience which both nature and repeated oath
    obliged them to, THAN HE DID FROM HIS WORD, they had still remained
    as happy a people as they really were during his short reign in
    England."The words printed in small
    caps in this extract are from the interlineations of the son of King
    James II.]This being the substance of what he said, the Lords desired it might be
published, as containing matter of great satisfaction to a jealous
people upon this change, which his Majesty consented to.Then were the
Council sworn, and a Proclamation ordered to be published that all
officers should continue in their stations, that there might be no
failure of public justice, till his further pleasure should be known.Then the King rose, the Lords accompanying him to his bedchamber, where,
while he reposed himself, tired indeed as he was with grief and
watching, they returned again into the Council chamber to take order for
the PROCLAIMING his Majesty, which (after some debate) they consented
should be in the very form his grandfather, King James I., was, after
the death of Queen Elizabeth; as likewise that the Lords, etc., should
proceed in their coaches through the city for the more solemnity of it.Upon this was I, and several other gentlemen waiting in the Privy
gallery, admitted into the Council chamber to be witness of what was
resolved on.Thence with the Lords, Lord Marshal and Heralds, and other
Crown officers being ready, we first went to Whitehall gate, where the
Lords stood on foot bareheaded, while the Herald proclaimed his
Majesty's title to the Imperial Crown and succession according to the
form, the trumpets and kettledrums having first sounded three times,
which ended with the people's acclamations.Then a herald called the
Lords' coaches according to rank, myself accompanying the solemnity in
my Lord Cornwallis's coach, first to Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor
and his brethren met us on horseback, in all their formalities, and
proclaimed the King; hence to the Exchange in Cornhill, and so we
returned in the order we set forth.Being come to Whitehall, we all went
and kissed the King and Queen's hands.He had been on the bed, but was
now risen and in his undress.The Queen was in bed in her apartment, but
put forth her hand, seeming to be much afflicted, as I believe she was,
having deported herself so decently upon all occasions since she came
into England, which made her universally beloved.I can never forget the inexpressible luxury and profaneness, gaming, and
all dissoluteness, and as it were total forgetfulness of God (it being
Sunday evening), which this day se'nnight I was witness of, the King
sitting and toying with his concubines, Portsmouth, Cleveland, and
Mazarin, etc., a French boy singing love songs[57] in that glorious
gallery, while about twenty of the great courtiers and other dissolute
persons were at Basset round a large table, a bank of at least 2,000 in
gold before them; upon which two gentlemen, who were with me, made
reflections with astonishment.Six days after, was all in the dust.[Footnote 57: _Ante_, p.It was enjoined that those who put on mourning should wear it as for a
father, in the most solemn manner.Being sent to by the Sheriff of the County to
appear and assist in proclaiming the King, I went the next day to
Bromley, where I met the Sheriff and the Commander of the Kentish Troop,
with an appearance, I suppose, of about 500 horse, and innumerable
people, two of his Majesty's trumpets, and a Sergeant with other
officers, who having drawn up the horse in a large field near the town,
marched thence, with swords drawn, to the market place, where, making a
ring, after sound of trumpets and silence made, the High Sheriff read
the proclaiming titles to his bailiff, who repeated them aloud, and
then, after many shouts of the people, his Majesty's health being drunk
in a flint glass of a yard long, by the Sheriff, Commander, Officers,
and chief gentlemen, they all dispersed, and I returned.I passed a fine on selling of Honson Grange in
Staffordshire, being about L20 per annum, which lying so great a
distance, I thought fit to part with it to one Burton, a farmer there.It came to me as part of my daughter-in-law's portion, this being but a
fourth part of what was divided between the mother and three sisters.The King was this night very obscurely buried in a
vault under Henry VII.'s Chapel at Westminster, without any manner of
pomp, and soon forgotten after all this vanity, and the face of the
whole Court was exceedingly changed into a more solemn and moral
behavior; the new King affecting neither profaneness nor buffoonery.All
the great officers broke their staves over the grave, according to form.The second
sermon should have been before the King; but he, to the great grief of
his subjects, did now, for the first time, go to mass publicly in the
little Oratory at the Duke's lodgings, the doors being set wide open.I dined at Sir Robert Howard's, auditor of the
exchequer, a gentleman pretending to all manner of arts and sciences,
for which he had been the subject of comedy, under the name of Sir
Positive; not ill-natured, but insufferably boasting.He was son to the
late Earl of Berkshire.This morning his Majesty restored the staff and key
to Lord Arlington, Chamberlain; to Mr.Savell, Vice-chamberlain; to
Lords Newport and Maynard, Treasurer and Comptroller of the household.Lord Godolphin made Chamberlain to the Queen; Lord Peterborough groom of
the stole, in place of the Earl of Bath; the Treasurer's staff to the
Earl of Rochester; and his brother, the Earl of Clarendon, Lord Privy
Seal, in the place of the Marquis of Halifax, who was made President of
the Council; the Secretaries of State remaining as before.The Lord Treasurer and the other new officers were
sworn at the Chancery Bar and the exchequer.The late King having the revenue of excise, customs, and other late
duties granted for his life only, they were now farmed and let to
several persons, upon an opinion that the late King might let them for
three years after his decease; some of the old commissioners refused to
act.The lease was made but the day before the King died;[58] the major
part of the Judges (but, as some think, not the best lawyers),
pronounced it legal, but four dissented.[Footnote 58: James, in his Life, makes no mention of this lease,
    but only says HE continued to collect them, which conduct was not
    blamed; but, on the contrary, he was thanked for it, in an address
    from the Middle Temple, penned by Sir Bartholomew Shore, and
    presented by Sir Humphrey Mackworth, carrying great authority with
    it; nor did the Parliament find fault.]The clerk of the closet had shut up the late King's private oratory next
the Privy-chamber above, but the King caused it to be opened again, and
that prayers should be said as formerly.Several most useful tracts against Dissenters,
<DW7>s and Fanatics, and resolutions of cases were now published by the
London divines.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th March, 1685.To my grief, I saw the new pulpit set up in the Popish
Oratory at Whitehall for the Lent preaching, mass being publicly said,
and the Romanists swarming at Court with greater confidence than had
ever been seen in England since the Reformation, so that everybody grew
jealous as to what this would tend.A Parliament was now summoned, and great industry used to obtain
elections which might promote the Court interest, most of the
corporations being now, by their new charters, empowered to make what
returns of members they pleased.There came over divers envoys and great persons to condole the death of
the late King, who were received by the Queen-Dowager on a bed of
mourning, the whole chamber, ceiling and floor, hung with black, and
tapers were lighted, so as nothing could be more lugubrious and solemn.The Queen-Consort sat under a state on a black foot-cloth, to entertain
the circle (as the Queen used to do), and that very decently.Lent preachers continued as formerly in the Royal
Chapel.My daughter, Mary, was taken with smallpox, and there
soon was found no hope of her recovery.A great affliction to me: but
God's holy will be done!She received the blessed sacrament; after which,
disposing herself to suffer what God should determine to inflict, she
bore the remainder of her sickness with extraordinary patience and
piety, and more than ordinary resignation and blessed frame of mind.She
died the 14th, to our unspeakable sorrow and affliction, and not to
our's only, but that of all who knew her, who were many of the best
quality, greatest and most virtuous persons.The justness of her
stature, person, comeliness of countenance, gracefulness of motion,
unaffected, though more than ordinarily beautiful, were the least of her
ornaments compared with those of her mind.Of early piety, singularly
religious, spending a part of every day in private devotion, reading,
and other virtuous exercises; she had collected and written out many of
the most useful and judicious periods of the books she read in a kind of
common-place, as out of Dr.Hammond on the New Testament, and most of
the best practical treatises.She had read and digested a considerable
deal of history, and of places.The French tongue was as familiar to her
as English; she understood Italian, and was able to render a laudable
account of what she read and observed, to which assisted a most faithful
memory and discernment; and she did make very prudent and discreet
reflections upon what she had observed of the conversations among which
she had at any time been, which being continually of persons of the best
quality, she thereby improved.She had an excellent voice, to which she
played a thorough-bass on the harpsichord, in both which she arrived to
that perfection, that of the scholars of those two famous masters,
Signors Pietro and Bartholomeo, she was esteemed the best; for the
sweetness of her voice and management of it added such an agreeableness
to her countenance, without any constraint or concern, that when she
sung, it was as charming to the eye as to the ear; this I rather note,
because it was a universal remark, and for which so many noble and
judicious persons in music desired to hear her, the last being at Lord
Arundel's, at Wardour.What shall I say, or rather not say, of the cheerfulness and
agreeableness of her humor?condescending to the meanest servant in the
family, or others, she still kept up respect, without the least pride.She would often read to them, examine, instruct, and pray with them if
they were sick, so as she was exceedingly beloved of everybody.Piety
was so prevalent an ingredient in her constitution (as I may say), that
even among equals and superiors she no sooner became intimately
acquainted, but she would endeavor to improve them, by insinuating
something religious, and that tended to bring them to a love of
devotion; she had one or two confidants with whom she used to pass whole
days in fasting, reading, and prayers, especially before the monthly
communion, and other solemn occasions.She abhorred flattery, and,
though she had abundance of wit, the raillery was so innocent and
ingenious that it was most agreeable; she sometimes would see a play,
but since the stage grew licentious, expressed herself weary of them,
and the time spent at the theater was an unaccountable vanity.She never
played at cards without extreme importunity and for the company; but
this was so very seldom, that I cannot number it among anything she
could name a fault.No one could read prose or verse better or with more judgment; and as
she read, so she wrote, not only most correct orthography, with that
maturity of judgment and exactness of the periods, choice of
expressions, and familiarity of style, that some letters of hers have
astonished me and others, to whom she has occasionally written.She had
a talent of rehearsing any comical part or poem, as to them she might be
decently free with; was more pleasing than heard on the theater; she
danced with the greatest grace I had ever seen, and so would her master
say, who was Monsieur Isaac; but she seldom showed that perfection, save
in the gracefulness of her carriage, which was with an air of sprightly
modesty not easily to be described.Nothing affected, but natural and
easy as well in her deportment as in her discourse, which was always
material, not trifling, and to which the extraordinary sweetness of her
tone, even in familiar speaking, was very charming.Nothing was so
pretty as her descending to play with little children, whom she would
caress and humor with great delight.But she most affected to be with
grave and sober men, of whom she might learn something, and improve
herself.I have been assisted by her in reading and praying by me;
comprehensive of uncommon notions, curious of knowing everything to some
excess, had I not sometimes repressed it.Nothing was so delightful to her as to go into my Study, where she would
willingly have spent whole days, for as I said she had read abundance of
history, and all the best poets, even Terence, Plautus, Homer, Virgil,
Horace, Ovid; all the best romancers and modern poems; she could compose
happily and put in pretty symbols, as in the "_Mundus Muliebris_,"
wherein is an enumeration of the immense variety of the modes and
ornaments belonging to the sex.But all these are vain trifles to the
virtues which adorned her soul; she was sincerely religious, most
dutiful to her parents, whom she loved with an affection tempered with
great esteem, so as we were easy and free, and never were so well
pleased as when she was with us, nor needed we other conversation; she
was kind to her sisters, and was still improving them by her constant
course of piety.Oh, dear, sweet, and desirable child, how shall I part
with all this goodness and virtue without the bitterness of sorrow and
reluctancy of a tender parent!Thy affection, duty and love to me was
that of a friend as well as a child.Nor less dear to thy mother, whose
example and tender care of thee was unparalleled, nor was thy return to
her less conspicuous.To the grave shall we both carry thy memory!God alone (in
whose bosom thou art at rest and happy!)give us to resign thee and all
our contentments (for thou indeed wert all in this world) to his blessed
pleasure!Let him be glorified by our submission, and give us grace to
bless him for the graces he implanted in thee, thy virtuous life, pious
and holy death, which is indeed the only comfort of our souls, hastening
through the infinite love and mercy of the Lord Jesus to be shortly with
thee, dear child, and with thee and those blessed saints like thee,
glorify the Redeemer of the world to all eternity!It was in the 19th year of her age that this sickness happened to her.An accident contributed to this disease; she had an apprehension of it
in particular, which struck her but two days before she came home, by an
imprudent gentlewoman whom she went with Lady Falkland to visit, who,
after they had been a good while in the house, told them she has a
servant sick of the smallpox (who indeed died the next day): this my
poor child acknowledged made an impression on her spirits.There were
four gentlemen of quality offering to treat with me about marriage, and
I freely gave her her own choice, knowing her discretion.She showed
great indifference to marrying at all, for truly, says she to her mother
(the other day), were I assured of your life and my dear father's, never
would I part from you; I love you and this home, where we serve God,
above all things, nor ever shall I be so happy; I know and consider the
vicissitudes of the world, I have some experience of its vanities, and
but for decency more than inclination, and that you judge it expedient
for me, I would not change my condition, but rather add the fortune you
design me to my sisters, and keep up the reputation of our family.This
was so discreetly and sincerely uttered that it could not but proceed
from an extraordinary child, and one who loved her parents beyond
example.At London, she took this fatal disease, and the occasion of her being
there was this: my Lord Viscount Falkland's Lady having been our
neighbor (as he was Treasurer of the Navy), she took so great an
affection to my daughter, that when they went back in the autumn to the
city, nothing would satisfy their incessant importunity but letting her
accompany my Lady, and staying some time with her; it was with the
greatest reluctance I complied.While she was there, my Lord being
musical, when I saw my Lady would not part with her till Christmas, I
was not unwilling she should improve the opportunity of learning of
Signor Pietro, who had an admirable way both of composure and teaching.It was the end of February before I could prevail with my Lady to part
with her; but my Lord going into Oxfordshire to stand for Knight of the
Shire there, she expressed her wish to come home, being tired of the
vain and empty conversation of the town, the theaters, the court, and
trifling visits which consumed so much precious time, and made her
sometimes miss of that regular course of piety that gave her the
greatest satisfaction.She was weary of this life, and I think went not
thrice to Court all this time, except when her mother or I carried her.She did not affect showing herself, she knew the Court well, and passed
one summer in it at Windsor with Lady Tuke, one of the Queen's women of
the bedchamber (a most virtuous relation of hers); she was not fond of
that glittering scene, now become abominably licentious, though there
was a design of Lady Rochester and Lady Clarendon to have made her a
maid of honor to the Queen as soon as there was a vacancy.But this she
did not set her heart upon, nor indeed on anything so much as the
service of God, a quiet and regular life, and how she might improve
herself in the most necessary accomplishments, and to which she was
arrived at so great a measure.This is the little history and imperfect character of my dear child,
whose piety, virtue, and incomparable endowments deserve a monument more
durable than brass and marble.Much I could enlarge on every period of this hasty account, but that I
ease and discharge my overcoming passion for the present, so many things
worthy an excellent Christian and dutiful child crowding upon me.Never
can I say enough, oh dear, my dear child, whose memory is so precious to
me!This dear child was born at Wotton, in the same house and chamber in
which I first drew my breath, my wife having retired to my brother there
in the great sickness that year upon the first of that month, and the
very hour that I was born, upon the last: viz, October.[Sidenote: SAYES COURT]

16th March, 1685.She was interred in the southeast end of the church at
Deptford, near her grandmother and several of my younger children and
relations.My desire was she should have been carried and laid among my
own parents and relations at Wotton, where I desire to be interred
myself, when God shall call me out of this uncertain transitory life,
but some circumstances did not permit it.Holden,
preached her funeral sermon on Phil."For to me to live is
Christ, and to die is gain," upon which he made an apposite discourse,
as those who heard it assured me (for grief suffered me not to be
present), concluding with a modest recital of her many virtues and
signal piety, so as to draw both tears and admiration from the hearers.I was not altogether unwilling that something of this sort should be
spoken, for the edification and encouragement of other young people.Divers noble persons honored her funeral, some in person, others
sending their coaches, of which there were six or seven with six horses,
viz, the Countess of Sunderland, Earl of Clarendon, Lord Godolphin, Sir
Stephen Fox, Sir William Godolphin, Viscount Falkland, and others.There
were distributed among her friends about sixty rings.Thus lived, died, and was buried the joy of my life, and ornament of her
sex and of my poor family!God Almighty of his infinite mercy grant me
the grace thankfully to resign myself and all I have, or had, to his
divine pleasure, and in his good time, restoring health and comfort to
my family: "teach me so to number my days, that I may apply my heart to
wisdom," be prepared for my dissolution, and that into the hands of my
blessed Savior I may recommend my spirit!On looking into her closet, it is incredible what a number of
collections she had made from historians, poets, travelers, etc., but,
above all, devotions, contemplations, and resolutions on these
contemplations, found under her hand in a book most methodically
disposed; prayers, meditations, and devotions on particular occasions,
with many pretty letters to her confidants; one to a divine (not named)
to whom she writes that he would be her ghostly father, and would not
despise her for her many errors and the imperfections of her youth, but
beg of God to give her courage to acquaint him with all her faults,
imploring his assistance and spiritual directions.I well remember she
had often desired me to recommend her to such a person; but I did not
think fit to do it as yet, seeing her apt to be scrupulous, and knowing
the great innocency and integrity of her life.It is astonishing how one who had acquired such substantial and
practical knowledge in other ornamental parts of education, especially
music, both vocal and instrumental, in dancing, paying and receiving
visits, and necessary conversation, could accomplish half of what she
has left; but, as she never affected play or cards, which consume a
world of precious time, so she was in continual exercise, which yet
abated nothing of her most agreeable conversation.But she was a little
miracle while she lived, and so she died!I was invited to the funeral of Captain Gunman, that
excellent pilot and seaman, who had behaved himself so gallantly in the
Dutch war.He died of a gangrene, occasioned by his fall from the pier
of Calais.This was the Captain of the yacht carrying the Duke (now
King) to Scotland, and was accused for not giving timely warning when
she split on the sands, where so many perished; but I am most confident
he was no ways guilty, either of negligence, or design, as he made
appear not only at the examination of the matter of fact, but in the
vindication he showed me, and which must needs give any man of reason
satisfaction.He was a sober, frugal, cheerful, and temperate man; we
have few such seamen left.Being now somewhat composed after my great affliction,
I went to London to hear Dr.Tenison (it being on a Wednesday in Lent)
at Whitehall.I observed that though the King was not in his seat above
in the chapel, the Doctor made his three congees, which they were not
used to do when the late King was absent, making then one bowing only.I
asked the reason; it was said he had a special order so to do.The
Princess of Denmark was in the King's closet, but sat on the left hand
of the chair, the Clerk of the Closet standing by his Majesty's chair,
as if he had been present.I met the Queen Dowager going now first from Whitehall to dwell at
Somerset House.This day my brother of Wotton and Mr.Onslow were candidates for Surrey
against Sir Adam Brown and my cousin, Sir Edward Evelyn, and were
circumvented in their election by a trick of the Sheriff's, taking
advantage of my brother's party going out of the small village of
Leatherhead to seek shelter and lodging, the afternoon being
tempestuous, proceeding to the election when they were gone; they
expecting the next morning; whereas before and then they exceeded the
other party by many hundreds, as I am assured.The Duke of Norfolk led
Sir Edward Evelyn's and Sir Adam Brown's party.For this Parliament,
very mean and slight persons (some of them gentlemen's servants, clerks,
and persons neither of reputation nor interest) were set up; but the
country would choose my brother whether he would or no, and he missed it
by the trick above mentioned.Sir Adam Brown was so deaf, that he could
not hear one word.Sir Edward Evelyn was an honest gentleman, much in
favor with his Majesty.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th April, 1685.I went early to Whitehall to hear Dr.Tillotson, Dean
of Canterbury, preaching on Eccles.I returned in the evening,
and visited Lady Tuke, and found with her Sir George Wakeman, the
physician, whom I had seen tried and acquitted, among the plotters for
poisoning the late King, on the accusation of the famous Oates; and
surely I believed him guiltless.According to my custom, I went to London to pass the
holy week.Tenison preached at the new church at
St.22, upon the infinite love of God to us, which
he illustrated in many instances.The Holy Sacrament followed, at which
I participated.Sprat,
Bishop of Rochester, preached in Whitehall chapel, the auditory very
full of Lords, the two Archbishops, and many others, now drawn to town
upon occasion of the coronation and ensuing Parliament.I supped with
the Countess of Sunderland and Lord Godolphin, and returned home.Was the coronation of the King and Queen.The solemnity
was magnificent as is set forth in print.The Bishop of Ely preached;
but, to the sorrow of the people, no Sacrament, as ought to have been.However, the King begins his reign with great expectations, and hopes of
much reformation as to the late vices and profaneness of both Court and
country.Having been present at the late King's coronation, I was not
ambitious of seeing this ceremony.A young man preached, going chaplain with Sir J. Wiburn,
Governor of Bombay, in the East Indies.I was in Westminster Hall when Oates, who had made such
a stir in the kingdom, on his revealing a plot of the <DW7>s, and
alarmed several Parliaments, and had occasioned the execution of divers
priests, noblemen, etc., was tried for perjury at the King's bench; but,
being very tedious, I did not endeavor to see the issue, considering
that it would be published.Abundance of Roman Catholics were in the
hall in expectation of the most grateful conviction and ruin of a person
who had been so obnoxious to them, and as I verily believe, had done
much mischief and great injury to several by his violent and
ill-grounded proceedings; while he was at first so unreasonably blown up
and encouraged, that his insolence was no longer sufferable.Roger L'Estrange (a gentleman whom I had long known, and a person of
excellent parts, abating some affectations) appearing first against the
Dissenters in several tracts, had now for some years turned his style
against those whom (by way of hateful distinction) they called Whigs and
Trimmers, under the title of "Observator," which came out three or four
days every week, in which sheets, under pretense to serve the Church of
England, he gave suspicion of gratifying another party, by several
passages which rather kept up animosities than appeased them, especially
now that nobody gave the least occasion.[59]

    [Footnote 59: In the first Dutch war, while Evelyn was one of the
    Commissioners for sick and wounded, L'Estrange in his "Gazette"
    mentioned the barbarous usage of the Dutch prisoners of war:
    whereupon Evelyn wrote him a very spirited letter, desiring that the
    Dutch Ambassador (who was then in England) and his friends would
    visit the prisoners, and examine their provisions; and he required
    L'Estrange to publish that vindication in his next number.]The Scots valuing themselves exceedingly to have been
the first Parliament called by his Majesty, gave the excise and customs
to him and his successors forever; the Duke of Queensberry making
eloquent speeches, and especially minding them of a speedy suppression
of those late desperate Field-Conventiclers who had done such unheard of
assassinations.In the meantime, elections for the ensuing Parliament in
England were thought to be very indirectly carried on in most places.God grant a better issue of it than some expect!Oates was sentenced to be whipped and pilloried with the
utmost severity.I dined at my Lord Privy Seal's with Sir William
Dugdale, Garter King-at-Arms, author of the "MONASTICON" and other
learned works; he told me he was 82 years of age, and had his sight and
memory perfect.There was shown a draft of the exact shape and
dimensions of the crown the Queen had been crowned withal, together with
the jewels and pearls, their weight and value, which amounted to
L100,658 sterling, attested at the foot of the paper by the jeweler and
goldsmith who set them.In the morning, I went with a French gentleman, and my
Lord Privy Seal to the House of Lords, where we were placed by his
Lordship next the bar, just below the bishops, very commodiously both
for hearing and seeing.After a short space, came in the Queen and
Princess of Denmark, and stood next above the archbishops, at the side
of the House on the right hand of the throne.In the interim, divers of
the Lords, who had not finished before, took the test and usual oaths,
so that her Majesty, the Spanish and other Ambassadors, who stood behind
the throne, heard the Pope and the worship of the Virgin Mary, etc.,
renounced very decently, as likewise the prayers which followed,
standing all the while.Then came in the King, the crown on his head,
and being seated, the Commons were introduced, and the House being full,
he drew forth a paper containing his speech, which he read distinctly
enough, to this effect: "That he resolved to call a Parliament from the
moment of his brother's decease, as the best means to settle all the
concerns of the nation, so as to be most easy and happy to himself and
his subjects; that he would confirm whatever he had said in his
declaration at the first Council concerning his opinion of the
principles of the Church of England, for their loyalty, and would defend
and support it, and preserve its government as by law now established;
that, as he would invade no man's property, so he would never depart
from his own prerogative; and, as he had ventured his life in defense of
the nation, so he would proceed to do still; that, having given this
assurance of his care of our religion (his word was YOUR religion) and
property (which he had not said by chance, but solemnly), so he doubted
not of suitable returns of his subjects' duty and kindness, especially
as to settling his revenue for life, for the many weighty necessities of
government, which he would not suffer to be precarious; that some might
possibly suggest that it were better to feed and supply him from time to
time only, out of their inclination to frequent Parliaments; but that
that would be a very improper method to take with him, since the best
way to engage him to meet oftener would be always to use him well, and
therefore he expected their compliance speedily, that this session being
but short, they might meet again to satisfaction."At every period of this, the House gave loud shouts.Then he acquainted
them with that morning's news of Argyle's being landed in the West
Highlands of Scotland from Holland, and the treasonous declaration he
had published, which he would communicate to them, and that he should
take the best care he could it should meet with the reward it deserved,
not questioning the Parliament's zeal and readiness to assist him as he
desired; at which there followed another "_Vive le Roi_," and so his
Majesty retired.So soon as the Commons were returned and had put themselves into a grand
committee, they immediately put the question, and unanimously voted the
revenue to his Majesty for life.Seymour made a bold speech against
many elections, and would have had those members who (he pretended) were
obnoxious, to withdraw, till they had cleared the matter of their being
legally returned; but no one seconded him.The truth is, there were many
of the new members whose elections and returns were universally
censured, many of them being persons of no condition, or interest, in
the nation, or places for which they served, especially in Devon,
Cornwall, Norfolk, etc., said to have been recommended by the Court, and
from the effect of the new charters changing the electors.It was
reported that Lord Bath carried down with him [into Cornwall] no fewer
than fifteen charters, so that some called him the Prince Elector:
whence Seymour told the House in his speech that if this was digested,
they might introduce what religion and laws they pleased, and that
though he never gave heed to the fears and jealousies of the people
before, he was now really apprehensive of Popery.By the printed list of
members of 505, there did not appear to be above 135 who had been in
former Parliaments, especially that lately held at Oxford.In the Lords' House, Lord Newport made an exception against two or three
young Peers, who wanted some months, and some only four or five days, of
being of age.The Popish Lords, who had been sometime before released from their
confinement about the plot, were now discharged of their impeachment, of
which I gave Lord Arundel of Wardour joy.Oates, who had but two days before been pilloried at several places and
whipped at the cart's tail from Newgate to Aldgate, was this day placed
on a sledge, being not able to go by reason of so late scourging, and
dragged from prison to Tyburn, and whipped again all the way, which some
thought to be severe and extraordinary; but, if he was guilty of the
perjuries, and so of the death of many innocents (as I fear he was), his
punishment was but what he deserved.I chanced to pass just as execution
was doing on him.Note: there was no speech made by the Lord Keeper [Bridgman] after his
Majesty, as usual.It was whispered he would not be long in that situation, and many
believe the bold Chief Justice Jefferies, who was made Baron of Wem, in
Shropshire, and who went thorough stitch in that tribunal, stands fair
for that office.I gave him joy the morning before of his new honor, he
having always been very civil to me.We had hitherto not any rain for many months, so as the
caterpillars had already devoured all the winter fruit through the whole
land, and even killed several greater old trees.Such two winters and
summers I had never known.Came to visit and take leave of me Sir Gabriel Sylvius,
now going Envoy-extraordinary into Denmark, with his secretary and
chaplain, a Frenchman, who related the miserable persecution of the
Protestants in France; not above ten churches left them, and those also
threatened to be demolished; they were commanded to christen their
children within twenty-four hours after birth, or else a Popish priest
was to be called, and then the infant brought up in Popery.In some
places, they were thirty leagues from any minister, or opportunity of
worship.This persecution had displeased the most industrious part of
the nation, and dispersed those into Switzerland, Burgundy, Holland,
Germany, Denmark, England, and the Plantations.There were with Sir
Gabriel, his lady, Sir William Godolphin and sisters, and my Lord
Godolphin's little son, my charge.I brought them to the water side
where Sir Gabriel embarked, and the rest returned to London.There was now certain intelligence of the Duke of
Monmouth landing at Lyme, in Dorsetshire, and of his having set up his
standard as King of England.I pray God deliver us from the confusion
which these beginnings threaten!Such a dearth for want of rain was never in my memory.The Duke landed with but 150 men; but the whole kingdom
was alarmed, fearing that the disaffected would join them, many of the
trained bands flocking to him.At his landing, he published a
Declaration, charging his Majesty with usurpation and several horrid
crimes, on pretense of his own title, and offering to call a free
Parliament.This declaration was ordered to be burnt by the hangman, the
Duke proclaimed a traitor, and a reward of L5,000 to any who should kill
him.At this time, the words engraved on the monument in London, intimating
that the <DW7>s fired the city, were erased and cut out.I received a warrant to send out a horse with twelve
days' provisions, etc.We had now plentiful rain after two years' excessive
drought and severe winters.Argyle taken in Scotland, and executed, and his party dispersed.No considerable account of the troops sent against the
Duke, though great forces sent.There was a smart skirmish; but he would
not be provoked to come to an encounter, but still kept in the
fastnesses.Dangerfield whipped, like Oates, for perjury.Came news of Monmouth's utter defeat, and the next day
of his being taken by Sir William Portman and Lord Lumley with the
militia of their counties.It seems the Horse, commanded by Lord Grey,
being newly raised and undisciplined, were not to be brought in so short
a time to endure the fire, which exposed the Foot to the King's, so as
when Monmouth had led the Foot in great silence and order, thinking to
surprise Lieutenant-General Lord Feversham newly encamped, and given him
a smart charge, interchanging both great and small shot, the Horse,
breaking their own ranks, Monmouth gave it over, and fled with Grey,
leaving their party to be cut in pieces to the number of 2,000.The
whole number reported to be above 8,000; the King's but 2,700.The slain
were most of them MENDIP-MINERS, who did great execution with their
tools, and sold their lives very dearly, while their leaders flying were
pursued and taken the next morning, not far from one another.Monmouth
had gone sixteen miles on foot, changing his habit for a poor coat, and
was found by Lord Lumley in a dry ditch covered with fern-brakes, but
without sword, pistol, or any weapon, and so might have passed for some
countryman, his beard being grown so long and so gray as hardly to be
known, had not his George discovered him, which was found in his pocket.It is said he trembled exceedingly all over, not able to speak.Grey was
taken not far from him.Most of his party were Anabaptists and poor
cloth workers of the country, no gentlemen of account being come in to
him.The arch-_boutefeu_, Ferguson, Matthews, etc., were not yet found.The L5,000 to be given to whoever should bring Monmouth in, was to be
distributed among the militia by agreement between Sir William Portman
and Lord Lumley.The battle ended, some words, first in jest, then in
passion, passed between Sherrington Talbot (a worthy gentleman, son to
Sir John Talbot, and who had behaved himself very handsomely) and one
Captain Love, both commanders of the militia, as to whose soldiers
fought best, both drawing their swords and passing at one another.Sherrington was wounded to death on the spot, to the great regret of
those who knew him.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th July, 1685.Just as I was coming into the lodgings at Whitehall, a
little before dinner, my Lord of Devonshire standing very near his
Majesty's bedchamber door in the lobby, came Colonel Culpeper, and in a
rude manner looking at my Lord in the face, asked whether this was a
time and place for excluders to appear; my Lord at first took little
notice of what he said, knowing him to be a hotheaded fellow, but he
reiterating it, my Lord asked Culpeper whether he meant him; he said
yes, he meant his Lordship.My Lord told him he was no excluder (as
indeed he was not); the other affirming it again, my Lord told him he
lied; on which Culpeper struck him a box on the ear, which my Lord
returned, and felled him.They were soon parted, Culpeper was seized,
and his Majesty, who was all the while in his bedchamber, ordered him to
be carried to the Greencloth officer, who sent him to the Marshalsea, as
he deserved.I supped this night at Lambeth at my old friend's Mr.Elias Ashmole's,
with my Lady Clarendon, the Bishop of St.Sandra journeyed to the hallway.Tenison, when
we were treated at a great feast.The Count of Castel Mellor, that great favorite and
prime minister of Alphonso, late King of Portugal, after several years'
banishment, being now received to grace and called home by Don Pedro,
the present King, as having been found a person of the greatest
integrity after all his sufferings, desired me to spend part of this day
with him, and assist him in a collection of books and other curiosities,
which he would carry with him into Portugal.Hussey, a young gentleman who made love to my late dear child, but
whom she could not bring herself to answer in affection, died now of the
same cruel disease, for which I was extremely sorry, because he never
enjoyed himself after my daughter's decease, nor was I averse to the
match, could she have overcome her disinclination.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th July, 1685.Monmouth was this day brought to London and examined before the King,
to whom he made great submission, acknowledged his seduction by
Ferguson, the Scot, whom he named the bloody villain.He was sent to the
Tower, had an interview with his late Duchess, whom he received coldly,
having lived dishonestly with the Lady Henrietta Wentworth for two
years.He obstinately asserted his conversation with that debauched
woman to be no sin; whereupon, seeing he could not be persuaded to his
last breath, the divines who were sent to assist him thought not fit to
administer the Holy Communion to him.For the rest of his faults he
professed great sorrow, and so died without any apparent fear.He would
not make use of a cap or other circumstance, but lying down, bid the
fellow to do his office better than to the late Lord Russell, and gave
him gold; but the wretch made five chops before he had his head off;
which so incensed the people, that had he not been guarded and got away,
they would have torn him to pieces.The Duke made no speech on the scaffold (which was on Tower Hill), but
gave a paper containing not above five or six lines, for the King, in
which he disclaims all title to the Crown, acknowledges that the late
King, his father, had indeed told him he was but his base son, and so
desired his Majesty to be kind to his wife and children.Martin's), who, with the Bishops of
Ely and Bath and Wells, were sent to him by his Majesty, and were at the
execution.Thus ended this quondam Duke, darling of his father and the ladies,
being extremely handsome and adroit, an excellent soldier and dancer, a
favorite of the people, of an easy nature, debauched by lust; seduced by
crafty knaves, who would have set him up only to make a property, and
taken the opportunity of the King being of another religion, to gather a
party of discontented men.He was a lovely person, had a virtuous and excellent lady that brought
him great riches, and a second dukedom in Scotland.He was Master of the
Horse, General of the King his father's army, Gentleman of the
Bedchamber, Knight of the Garter, Chancellor of Cambridge, in a word,
had accumulations without end.See what ambition and want of principles
brought him to!He was beheaded on Tuesday, 14th of July.His mother,
whose name was Barlow, daughter of some very mean creatures, was a
beautiful strumpet, whom I had often seen at Paris; she died miserably
without anything to bury her; yet this Perkin had been made to believe
that the King had married her, a monstrous and ridiculous forgery!And
to satisfy the world of the iniquity of the report, the King his father
(if his father he really was, for he most resembled one Sidney who was
familiar with his mother) publicly and most solemnly renounced it, to be
so entered in the Council Book some years since, with all the Privy
Councillors' attestation.[60]

    [Footnote 60: The "Life of James II."contains an account of the
    circumstances of the Duke of Monmouth's birth, which may be given in
    illustration of the statements of the text.Ross, tutor to the Duke
    of Monmouth, is there said to have proposed to Bishop Cosins to sign
    a certificate of the King's marriage to Mrs.Barlow, though her own
    name was Walters: but this the Bishop refused.She was born of a
    gentleman's family in Wales, but having little means and less grace,
    came to London to make her fortune.Algernon Sydney, then a Colonel
    in Cromwell's army, had agreed to give her fifty broad pieces (as he
    told the Duke of York); but being ordered hastily away with his
    regiment, he missed his bargain.She went into Holland, where she
    fell into the hands of his brother, Colonel Robert Sydney, who kept
    her for some time, till the King hearing of her, got her from him.On which the Colonel was heard to say, Let who will have her, she is
    already sped; and, after being with the King, she was so soon with
    child, that the world had no cause to doubt whose child it was, and
    the rather that when he grew to be a man, he very much resembled the
    Colonel both in stature and countenance, even to a wart on his face.In the King's absence she behaved
    so loosely, that on his return from his escape at Worcester he would
    have no further commerce with her, and she became a common
    prostitute at Paris.]Had it not pleased God to dissipate this attempt in the beginning, there
would in all appearance have gathered an irresistible force which would
have desperately proceeded to the ruin of the Church and Government; so
general was the discontent and expectation of the opportunity.For my
own part, I looked upon this deliverance as most signal.Such an
inundation of fanatics and men of impious principles must needs have
caused universal disorder, cruelty, injustice, rapine, sacrilege, and
confusion, an unavoidable civil war, and misery without end.Blessed be
God, the knot was happily broken, and a fair prospect of tranquillity
for the future, if we reform, be thankful, and make a right use of this
mercy!I went to see the muster of the six Scotch and English
regiments whom the Prince of Orange had lately sent to his Majesty out
of Holland upon this rebellion, but which were now returning, there
having been no occasion for their use.They were all excellently clad
and well disciplined, and were encamped on Blackheath with their tents:
the King and Queen came to see them exercise, and the manner of their
encampment, which was very neat and magnificent.By a gross mistake of the Secretary of his Majesty's Forces, it had
been ordered that they should be quartered in private houses, contrary
to an Act of Parliament, but, on my informing his Majesty timely of it,
it was prevented.The two horsemen which my son and myself sent into the county troops,
were now come home, after a month's being out to our great charge.The Trinity Company met this day, which should have
been on the Monday after Trinity, but was put off by reason of the Royal
Charter being so large, that it could not be ready before.Pepys, Secretary to the Admiralty, was a
second time chosen Master.There were present the Duke of Grafton, Lord
Dartmouth, Master of the Ordnance, the Commissioners of the Navy, and
Brethren of the Corporation.We went to church, according to custom, and
then took barge to the Trinity House, in London, where we had a great
dinner, above eighty at one table.[Sidenote: CHELSEA]

7th August, 1685.Watts, keeper of the Apothecaries'
garden of simples at Chelsea, where there is a collection of innumerable
rarities of that sort particularly, besides many rare annuals, the tree
bearing Jesuit's bark, which had done such wonders in quartan agues.What was very ingenious was the subterranean heat, conveyed by a stove
under the conservatory, all vaulted with brick, so as he has the doors
and windows open in the hardest frosts, secluding only the snow.Boscawen, with my Lord
Godolphin's little son, with whose education hitherto his father had
intrusted me.My daughter Elizabeth died of the smallpox, soon
after having married a young man, nephew of Sir John Tippett, Surveyor
of the Navy, and one of the Commissioners.The 30th, she was buried in
the church at Deptford.Thus, in less than six months were we deprived
of two children for our unworthiness and causes best known to God, whom
I beseech from the bottom of my heart that he will give us grace to make
that right use of all these chastisements, that we may become better,
and entirely submit in all things to his infinitely wise disposal.Lord Clarendon (Lord Privy Seal) wrote to let me
know that the King being pleased to send him Lord-Lieutenant into
Ireland, was also pleased to nominate me one of the Commissioners to
execute the office of Privy Seal during his Lieutenancy there, it
behoving me to wait upon his Majesty to give him thanks for this great
honor.I accompanied his Lordship to Windsor (dining by
the way of Sir Henry Capel's at Kew), where his Majesty receiving me
with extraordinary kindness, I kissed his hand, I told him how sensible
I was of his Majesty's gracious favor to me, that I would endeavor to
serve him with all sincerity, diligence, and loyalty, not more out of my
duty than inclination.He said he doubted not of it, and was glad he had
the opportunity to show me the kindness he had for me.After this, came
abundance of great men to give me joy.I went to prayer in the chapel, and heard
Dr.11, persuading to unity and peace, and to be mindful of our
own business, according to the advice of the apostle.Then I went to
hear a Frenchman who preached before the King and Queen in that splendid
chapel next St.Their Majesties going to mass, I withdrew
to consider the stupendous painting of the Hall, which, both for the art
and invention, deserve the inscription in honor of the painter, Signor
Verrio.receiving the Black Prince, coming
toward him in a Roman triumph.The throne, the carvings, etc., are incomparable, and I think
equal to any, and in many circumstances exceeding any, I have seen
abroad.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, with (among others) Sir William Soames,
designed Ambassador to Constantinople.About 6 o'clock came Sir Dudley and his brother Roger North, and
brought the Great Seal from my Lord Keeper, who died the day before at
his house in Oxfordshire.The King went immediately to council;
everybody guessing who was most likely to succeed this great officer;
most believing it could be no other than my Lord Chief Justice
Jefferies, who had so vigorously prosecuted the late rebels, and was now
gone the Western Circuit, to punish the rest that were secured in
several counties, and was now near upon his return.I took my leave of
his Majesty, who spoke very graciously to me, and supping that night at
Sir Stephen Fox's, I promised to dine there the next day.Pepys to Portsmouth, whither his
Majesty was going the first time since his coming to the Crown, to see
in what state the fortifications were.We took coach and six horses,
late after dinner, yet got to Bagshot that night.While supper was
making ready I went and made a visit to Mrs.Graham, some time maid of
honor to the Queen Dowager, now wife to James Graham, Esq., of the privy
purse to the King; her house being a walk in the forest, within a little
quarter of a mile from Bagshot town.Very importunate she was that I
would sup, and abide there that night; but, being obliged by my
companion, I returned to our inn, after she had shown me her house,
which was very commodious, and well furnished, as she was an excellent
housewife, a prudent and virtuous lady.There is a park full of red deer
about it.Her eldest son was now sick there of the smallpox, but in a
likely way of recovery, and other of her children run about, and among
the infected, which she said she let them do on purpose that they might
while young pass that fatal disease she fancied they were to undergo one
time or other, and that this would be the best: the severity of this
cruel distemper so lately in my poor family confirming much of what she
affirmed.[Sidenote: WINCHESTER]

16th September, 1685.The next morning, setting out early, we arrived
soon enough at Winchester to wait on the King, who was lodged at the
Dean's (Dr.I found very few with him besides my Lords
Feversham, Arran, Newport, and the Bishop of Bath and Wells.His Majesty
was discoursing with the bishops concerning miracles, and what strange
things the Saludadors[61] would do in Spain, as by creeping into heated
ovens without hurt, and that they had a black cross in the roof of their
mouths, but yet were commonly notorious and profane wretches; upon which
his Majesty further said, that he was so extremely difficult of
miracles, for fear of being imposed upon, that if he should chance to
see one himself, without some other witness, he should apprehend it a
delusion of his senses.Then they spoke of the boy who was pretended to
have a wanting leg restored him, so confidently asserted by Fr.To all of which the Bishop added a great miracle
happening in Winchester to his certain knowledge, of a poor, miserably
sick and decrepit child (as I remember long kept unbaptized) who
immediately on his baptism, recovered; as also of the salutary effect of
King Charles his Majesty's father's blood, in healing one that was
blind.[Footnote 61: Evelyn subjoins this note:--"As to that of the
    Saludador (of which likewise I remember Sir Arthur Hopton, formerly
    as Ambassador at Madrid, had told me many like wonders), Mr.Pepys
    passing through Spain, and being extremely inquisitive of the truth
    of these pretended miracles of the Saludadors, found a very famous
    one at last, to whom he offered a considerable reward if he would
    make a trial of the oven, or any other thing of that kind, before
    him; the fellow ingenuously told him, that finding he was a more
    than ordinary curious person, he would not deceive him, and so
    acknowledged that he could do none of the feats really, but that
    what they pretended was all a cheat, which he would easily discover,
    though the poor superstitious people were easily imposed upon; yet
    have these impostors an allowance of the Bishops to practice their
    jugglings.Pepys affirmed to me; but said he, I did not
    conceive it fit to interrupt his Majesty, who so solemnly told what
    they pretended to do.There was something said of the second sight happening to some persons,
especially Scotch; upon which his Majesty, and I think Lord Arran, told
us that Monsieur... a French nobleman, lately here in England, seeing
the late Duke of Monmouth come into the playhouse at London, suddenly
cried out to somebody sitting in the same box, "_Voila Monsieur comme il
entre sans tete!_" Afterward his Majesty spoke of some relics that had
effected strange cures, particularly a piece of our blessed Savior's
cross, that healed a gentleman's rotten nose by only touching.And
speaking of the golden cross and chain taken out of the coffin of St.Edward the Confessor at Westminster, by one of the singing-men, who, as
the scaffolds were taken down after his Majesty's coronation, espying a
hole in the tomb, and something glisten, put his hand in, and brought it
to the dean, and he to the King; his Majesty began to put the Bishop in
mind how earnestly the late King (his brother) called upon him during
his agony, to take out what he had in his pocket."I had thought," said
the King, "it had been for some keys, which might lead to some cabinet
that his Majesty would have me secure"; but, says he, "you will remember
that I found nothing in any of his pockets but a cross of gold, and a
few insignificant papers"; and thereupon he showed us the cross, and was
pleased to put it into my hand.It was of gold, about three inches long,
having on one side a crucifix enameled and embossed, the rest was graved
and garnished with goldsmiths' work, and two pretty broad table
amethysts (as I conceived), and at the bottom a pendant pearl; within
was enchased a little fragment, as was thought, of the true cross, and a
Latin inscription in gold and Roman letters.More company coming in,
this discourse ended.I may not forget a resolution which his Majesty
made, and had a little before entered upon it at the Council Board at
Windsor or Whitehall, that the <DW64>s in the plantations should all be
baptized, exceedingly declaiming against that impiety of their masters
prohibiting it, out of a mistaken opinion that they would be _ipso
facto_ free; but his Majesty persists in his resolution to have them
christened, which piety the Bishop blessed him for.I went out to see the new palace the late King had begun, and brought
almost to the covering.It is placed on the side of the hill, where
formerly stood the old castle.It is a stately fabric, of three sides
and a corridor, all built of brick, and cornished, windows and columns
at the break and entrance of free-stone.It was intended for a
hunting-house when his Majesty should come to these parts, and has an
incomparable prospect.I believe there had already been L20,000 and more
expended; but his now Majesty did not seem to encourage the finishing it
at least for a while.Hence to see the Cathedral, a reverend pile, and in good repair.There
are still the coffins of the six Saxon Kings, whose bones had been
scattered by the sacrilegious rebels of 1641, in expectation, I suppose,
of finding some valuable relics, and afterward gathered up again and put
into new chests, which stand above the stalls of the choir.[Sidenote: PORTSMOUTH]

17th September, 1685.Early next morning, we went to Portsmouth,
something before his Majesty arrived.We found all the road full of
people, the women in their best dress, in expectation of seeing the King
pass by, which he did, riding on horseback a good part of the way.The
Mayor and Aldermen with their mace, and in their formalities, were
standing at the entrance of the fort, a mile on this side of the town,
where the Mayor made a speech to the King, and then the guns of the fort
were fired, as were those of the garrison, as soon as the King was come
into Portsmouth.All the soldiers (near 3,000) were drawn up, and lining
the streets and platform to God's House (the name of the Governor's
residence), where, after he had viewed the new fortifications and
shipyard, his Majesty was entertained at a magnificent dinner by Sir...
Slingsby, the Lieutenant Governor, all the gentlemen in his train
sitting down at table with him, which I also had done, had I not been
before engaged to Sir Robert Holmes, Governor of the Isle of Wight, to
dine with him at a private house, where likewise we had a very sumptuous
and plentiful repast of excellent venison, fowl, fish, and fruit.After dinner, I went to wait on his Majesty again, who was pulling on
his boots in the Town Hall adjoining the house where he dined, and then
having saluted some ladies, who came to kiss his hand, he took horse for
Winchester, whither he returned that night.This hall is artificially
hung round with arms of all sorts, like the hall and keep at Windsor.Hence, to see the shipyard and dock, the fortifications, and other
things.Portsmouth, when finished, will be very strong, and a noble quay.There
were now thirty-two men-of-war in the harbor.I was invited by Sir R.
Beach, the Commissioner, where, after a great supper, Mr.Secretary and
myself lay that night, and the next morning set out for Guildford, where
we arrived in good hour, and so the day after to London.I had twice before been at Portsmouth, the Isle of Wight, etc., many
years since.I found this part of Hampshire bravely wooded, especially
about the house and estate of Colonel Norton, who though now in being,
having formerly made his peace by means of Colonel Legg, was formerly a
very fierce commander in the first Rebellion.His house is large, and
standing low, on the road from Winchester to Portsmouth.By what I observed in this journey, is that infinite industry,
sedulity, gravity, and great understanding and experience of affairs, in
his Majesty, that I cannot but predict much happiness to the nation, as
to its political government; and, if he so persist, there could be
nothing more desired to accomplish our prosperity, but that he was of
the national religion.Lord Clarendon's commission for Lieutenant of
Ireland was sealed this day.[Sidenote: LONDON]

2d October, 1685.Pepys with this
expression at the foot of it, "I have something to show you that I may
not have another time," and that I would not fail to dine with him.Houblon (a rich and
considerable merchant, whose father had fled out of Flanders on the
persecution of the Duke of Alva) into a private room, and told us that
being lately alone with his Majesty, and upon some occasion of speaking
concerning my late Lord Arlington dying a Roman Catholic, who had all
along seemed to profess himself a Protestant, taken all the tests, etc.,
till the day (I think) of his death, his Majesty said that as to his
inclinations he had known them long wavering, but from fear of losing
his places, he did not think it convenient to declare himself.There
are, says the King, those who believe the Church of Rome gives
dispensations for going to church, and many like things, but that is not
so; for if that might have been had, he himself had most reason to make
use of it.INDEED, he said, as to SOME MATRIMONIAL CASES, THERE ARE NOW
AND THEN DISPENSATIONS, but hardly in any cases else.Pepys to beg of his Majesty, if
he might ask it without offense, and for that his Majesty could not but
observe how it was whispered among many whether his late Majesty had
been reconciled to the Church of Rome; he again humbly besought his
Majesty to pardon his presumption, if he had touched upon a thing which
did not befit him to look into.The King ingenuously told him that he
both was and died a Roman Catholic, and that he had not long since
declared that it was upon some politic and state reasons, best known to
himself (meaning the King his brother), but that he was of that
persuasion: he bid him follow him into his closet, where opening a
cabinet, he showed him two papers, containing about a quarter of a
sheet, on both sides written, in the late King's own hand, several
arguments opposite to the doctrine of the Church of England, charging
her with heresy, novelty, and the fanaticism of other Protestants, the
chief whereof was, as I remember, our refusing to acknowledge the
primacy and infallibility of the Church of Rome; how impossible it was
that so many ages should never dispute it, till of late; how unlikely
our Savior would leave his Church without a visible Head and guide to
resort to, during his absence; with the like usual topic; so well penned
as to the discourse as did by no means seem to me to have been put
together by the late King yet written all with his own hand, blotted and
interlined, so as, if indeed it was not given him by some priest, they
might be such arguments and reasons as had been inculcated from time to
time, and here recollected; and, in the conclusion, showing his looking
on the Protestant religion (and by name the Church of England) to be
without foundation, and consequently false and unsafe.When his Majesty
had shown him these originals, he was pleased to lend him the copies of
these two papers, attested at the bottom in four or five lines under his
own hand.This nice and curious passage I
thought fit to set down.Though all the arguments and objections were
altogether weak, and have a thousand times been answered by our divines;
they are such as their priests insinuate among their proselytes, as if
nothing were Catholic but the Church of Rome, no salvation out of that,
no reformation sufferable, bottoming all their errors on St.Peter's
successors' unerring dictatorship, but proving nothing with any reason,
or taking notice of any objection which could be made against it.Here
all was taken for granted, and upon it a resolution and preference
implied.I was heartily sorry to see all this, though it was no other than was
to be suspected, by his late Majesty's too great indifference, neglect,
and course of life, that he had been perverted, and for secular respects
only professed to be of another belief, and thereby giving great
advantage to our adversaries, both the Court and generally the youth and
great persons of the nation becoming dissolute and highly profane.God
was incensed to make his reign very troublesome and unprosperous, by
wars, plagues, fires, loss of reputation by an universal neglect of the
public for the love of a voluptuous and sensual life, which a vicious
Court had brought into credit.I think of it with sorrow and pity, when
I consider how good and debonair a nature that unhappy Prince was; what
opportunities he had to have made himself the most renowned King that
ever swayed the British scepter, had he been firm to that Church for
which his martyred and blessed father suffered; and had he been grateful
to Almighty God, who so miraculously restored him, with so excellent a
religion; had he endeavored to own and propagate it as he should have
done, not only for the good of his kingdom, but of all the Reformed
Churches in christendom, now weakened and near ruined through our
remissness and suffering them to be supplanted, persecuted, and
destroyed, as in France, which we took no notice of.The consequence of
this, time will show, and I wish it may proceed no further.The
emissaries and instruments of the Church of Rome will never rest till
they have crushed the Church of England, as knowing that alone to be
able to cope with them, and that they can never answer her fairly, but
lie abundantly open to the irresistible force of her arguments,
antiquity and purity of her doctrine, so that albeit it may move God,
for the punishment of a nation so unworthy, to eclipse again the
profession of her here, and darkness and superstition prevail, I am most
confident the doctrine of the Church of England will never be
extinguished, but remain visible, if not eminent, to the consummation of
the world.I have innumerable reasons that confirm me in this opinion,
which I forbear to mention here.In the meantime, as to the discourse of his Majesty with Mr.Pepys, and
those papers, as I do exceedingly prefer his Majesty's free and
ingenuous profession of what his own religion is, beyond concealment
upon any politic accounts, so I think him of a most sincere and honest
nature, one on whose word one may rely, and that he makes a conscience
of what he promises, to perform it.In this confidence, I hope that the
Church of England may yet subsist, and when it shall please God to open
his eyes and turn his heart (for that is peculiarly in the Lord's hands)
to flourish also.In all events, whatever does become of the Church of
England, it is certainly, of all the Christian professions on the earth,
the most primitive, apostolical, and excellent.I had my picture drawn this week by the famous
Kneller.[Sidenote: LONDON]

14th October, 1685.I went to London about finishing my lodgings at
Whitehall.Being the King's birthday, there was a solemn ball
at Court, and before it music of instruments and voices.I happened by
accident to stand the very next to the Queen and the King, who talked
with me about the music.The King was now building all that range from east
to west by the court and garden to the street, and making a new chapel
for the Queen, whose lodgings were to be in this new building, as also a
new Council chamber and offices next the south end of the banqueting
house.I returned home, next morning, to London.I accompanied my Lady Clarendon to her house at
Swallowfield, in Berks, dining by the way at Mr.Graham's lodge at
Bagshot; the house, newly repaired and capacious enough for a good
family, stands in a park.Hence, we went to Swallowfield; this house is after the ancient
building of honorable gentlemen's houses, when they kept up ancient
hospitality, but the gardens and waters as elegant as it is possible to
make a flat by art and industry, and no mean expense, my lady being so
extraordinarily skilled in the flowery part, and my lord in diligence of
planting; so that I have hardly seen a seat which shows more tokens of
it than what is to be found here, not only in the delicious and rarest
fruits of a garden, but in those innumerable timber trees in the ground
about the seat, to the greatest ornament and benefit of the place.There
is one orchard of 1,000 golden, and other cider pippins; walks and
groves of elms, limes, oaks, and other trees.The garden is so beset
with all manner of sweet shrubs, that it perfumes the air.The
distribution also of the quarters, walks, and parterres, is excellent.The nurseries, kitchen-garden full of the most desirable plants; two
very noble orangeries well furnished: but, above all, the canal and fish
ponds, the one fed with a white, the other with a black running water,
fed by a quick and swift river, so well and plentifully stored with
fish, that for pike, carp, bream, and tench, I never saw anything
approaching it.We had at every meal carp and pike of a size fit for the
table of a Prince, and what added to the delight was, to see the
hundreds taken by the drag, out of which, the cook standing by, we
pointed out what we had most mind to, and had carp that would have been
worth at London twenty shillings a piece.The waters are flagged about
with _Calamus aromaticus_, with which my lady has hung a closet, that
retains the smell very perfectly.There is also a certain sweet willow
and other exotics: also a very fine bowling-green, meadow, pasture, and
wood; in a word, all that can render a country seat delightful.There is
besides a well-furnished library in the house.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th October, 1685.We returned to London, having been treated with all
sorts of cheer and noble freedom by that most religious and virtuous
lady.She was now preparing to go for Ireland with her husband, made
Lord Deputy, and went to this country house and ancient seat of her
father and family, to set things in order during her absence; but never
were good people and neighbors more concerned than all the country (the
poor especially) for the departure of this charitable woman; everyone
was in tears, and she as unwilling to part from them.There was among
them a maiden of primitive life, the daughter of a poor laboring man,
who had sustained her parents (some time since dead) by her labor, and
has for many years refused marriage, or to receive any assistance from
the parish, besides the little hermitage my lady gives her rent-free;
she lives on four pence a day, which she gets by spinning; says she
abounds and can give alms to others, living in great humility and
content, without any apparent affectation, or singularity; she is
continually working, praying, or reading, gives a good account of her
knowledge in religion, visits the sick; is not in the least given to
talk; very modest, of a simple not unseemingly behavior; of a comely
countenance, clad very plain, but clean and tight.In sum, she appears a
saint of an extraordinary sort, in so religious a life, as is seldom met
with in villages now-a-days.I was invited to dine at Sir Stephen Fox's with my
Lord Lieutenant, where was such a dinner for variety of all things as I
had seldom seen, and it was so for the trial of a master-cook whom Sir
Stephen had recommended to go with his Lordship into Ireland; there were
all the dainties not only of the season, but of what art could add,
venison, plain solid meat, fowl, baked and boiled meats, banquet
[dessert], in exceeding plenty, and exquisitely dressed.There also
dined my Lord Ossory and Lady (the Duke of Beaufort's daughter), my Lady
Treasurer, Lord Cornbury, and other visitors.At the Royal Society, an urn full of bones was
presented, dug up in a highway, while repairing it, in a field in
Camberwell, in Surrey; it was found entire with its cover, among many
others, believed to be truly Roman and ancient.Sir Richard Bulkeley described to us a model of a chariot he had
invented, which it was not possible to overthrow in whatever uneven way
it was drawn, giving us a wonderful relation of what it had performed in
that kind, for ease, expedition, and safety; there were some
inconveniences yet to be remedied--it would not contain more than one
person; was ready to take fire every ten miles; and being placed and
playing on no fewer than ten rollers, it made a most prodigious noise,
almost intolerable.A remedy was to be sought for these inconveniences.I dined at our great Lord Chancellor Jefferies', who
used me with much respect.This was the late Chief-Justice who had newly
been the Western Circuit to try the Monmouth conspirators, and had
formerly done such severe justice among the obnoxious in Westminster
Hall, for which his Majesty dignified him by creating him first a Baron,
and now Lord Chancellor.He had some years past been conversant in
Deptford; is of an assured and undaunted spirit, and has served the
Court interest on all the hardiest occasions; is of nature cruel, and a
slave of the Court.The French persecution of the Protestants raging
with the utmost barbarity, exceeded even what the very heathens used:
innumerable persons of the greatest birth and riches leaving all their
earthly substance, and hardly escaping with their lives, dispersed
through all the countries of Europe.The French tyrant abrogated the
Edict of Nantes which had been made in favor of them, and without any
cause; on a sudden demolishing all their churches, banishing,
imprisoning, and sending to the galleys all the ministers; plundering
the common people, and exposing them to all sorts of barbarous usage by
soldiers sent to ruin and prey on them; taking away their children;
forcing people to the Mass, and then executing them as relapsers; they
burnt their libraries, pillaged their goods, ate up their fields and
substance, banished or sent the people to the galleys, and seized on
their estates.There had now been numbered to pass through Geneva only
(and that by stealth, for all the usual passages were strictly guarded
by sea and land) 40,000 toward Switzerland.In Holland, Denmark, and all
about Germany, were dispersed some hundred thousands; besides those in
England, where, though multitudes of all degree sought for shelter and
welcome as distressed Christians and confessors, they found least
encouragement, by a fatality of the times we were fallen into, and the
uncharitable indifference of such as should have embraced them; and I
prey it be not laid to our charge.The famous Claude fled to Holland;
Allix and several more came to London, and persons of great estates came
over, who had forsaken all.France was almost dispeopled, the bankers so
broken, that the tyrant's revenue was exceedingly diminished,
manufactures ceased, and everybody there, save the Jesuits, abhorred
what was done, nor did the <DW7>s themselves approve it.What the
further intention is, time will show; but doubtless portending some
revolution.I was shown the harangue which the Bishop of Valentia on Rhone made in
the name of the Clergy, celebrating the French King, as if he was a God,
for persecuting the poor Protestants, with this expression in it, "That
as his victory over heresy was greater than all the conquests of
Alexander and Caesar, it was but what was wished in England; and that God
seemed to raise the French King to this power and magnanimous action,
that he might be in capacity to assist in doing the same here."This
paragraph is very bold and remarkable; several reflecting on Archbishop
Usher's prophecy as now begun in France, and approaching the orthodox in
all other reformed churches.One thing was much taken notice of, that
the "Gazettes" which were still constantly printed twice a week,
informing us what was done all over Europe, never spoke of this
wonderful proceeding in France; nor was any relation of it published by
any, save what private letters and the persecuted fugitives brought.Whence this silence, I list not to conjecture; but it appeared very
extraordinary in a Protestant country that we should know nothing of
what Protestants suffered, while great collections were made for them in
foreign places, more hospitable and Christian to appearance.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1685.It being an extraordinarily wet morning, and myself
indisposed by a very great rheum, I did not go to church, to my very
great sorrow, it being the first Gunpowder Conspiracy anniversary that
had been kept now these eighty years under a prince of the Roman
religion.Bonfires were forbidden on this day; what does this portend!The King in his speech
required continuance of a standing force instead of a militia, and
indemnity and dispensation to Popish officers from the Test; demands
very unexpected and unpleasing to the Commons.He also required a supply
of revenue, which they granted; but returned no thanks to the King for
his speech, till farther consideration.The Commons postponed finishing the bill for the
Supply, to consider the Test, and Popish officers; this was carried but
by one voice.I dined at Lambeth, my Lord Archbishop carrying me
with him in his barge; there were my Lord Deputy of Ireland, the Bishops
of Ely and St.Sherlock, and other divines; Sir William
Hayward, Sir Paul Rycaut, etc.The Parliament was adjourned to February, several
both of Lords and Commons excepting against some passage of his
Majesty's speech relating to the Test, and continuance of Popish
officers in command.This was a great surprise in a Parliament which
people believed would have complied in all things.Popish pamphlets and pictures sold publicly; no books nor answers to
them appearing till long after.I resigned my trust for composing a difference
between Mr.Hitherto was a very wet, warm season.Lord Sunderland was declared President of the
Council, and yet to hold his Secretary's place.The forces disposed into
several quarters through the kingdom are very insolent, on which are
great complaints.Lord Brandon, tried for the late conspiracy, was condemned and pardoned;
so was Lord Grey, his accuser and witness.Persecution in France raging, the French insolently visit our vessels,
and take away the fugitive Protestants; some escape in barrels.[Sidenote: GREENWICH]

10th December, 1685.To Greenwich, being put into the new Commission of
Sewers.Patrick, Dean of Peterborough, preached at
Whitehall, before the Princess of Denmark, who, since his Majesty came
to the Crown, always sat in the King's closet, and had the same bowings
and ceremonies applied to the place where she was, as his Majesty had
when there in person.Slayer showed us an experiment of a wonderful
nature, pouring first a very cold liquor into a glass, and superfusing
on it another, to appearance cold and clear liquor also; it first
produced a white cloud, then boiling, divers coruscations and actual
flames of fire mingled with the liquor, which being a little shaken
together, fixed divers suns and stars of real fire, perfectly globular,
on the sides of the glass, and which there stuck like so many
constellations, burning most vehemently, and resembling stars and
heavenly bodies, and that for a long space.It seemed to exhibit a
theory of the eduction of light out of the chaos, and the fixing or
gathering of the universal light into luminous bodies.This matter, or
phosphorus, was made out of human blood and urine, elucidating the vital
flame, or heat in animal bodies.I accompanied my Lord-Lieutenant as far as St.Alban's, there going out of town with him near 200 coaches of all the
great officers and nobility.The next morning taking leave, I returned
to London.I dined at the great entertainment his Majesty gave
the Venetian Ambassadors, Signors Zenno and Justiniani, accompanied with
ten more noble Venetians of their most illustrious families, Cornaro,
Maccenigo, etc., who came to congratulate their Majesties coming to the
Crown.The dinner was most magnificent and plentiful, at four tables,
with music, kettledrums, and trumpets, which sounded upon a whistle at
every health.The banquet [dessert] was twelve vast chargers piled up so
high that those who sat one against another could hardly see each other.Of these sweetmeats, which doubtless were some days piling up in that
exquisite manner, the Ambassadors touched not, but leaving them to the
spectators who came out of curiosity to see the dinner, were exceedingly
pleased to see in what a moment of time all that curious work was
demolished, the comfitures voided, and the tables cleared.Thus his
Majesty entertained them three days, which (for the table only) cost him
L600, as the Clerk of the Greencloth (Sir William Boreman) assured me.Dinner ended, I saw their procession, or cavalcade, to Whitehall,
innumerable coaches attending.The two Ambassadors had four coaches of
their own, and fifty footmen (as I remember), besides other equipage as
splendid as the occasion would permit, the Court being still in
mourning.Thence, I went to the audience which they had in the Queen's
presence chamber, the Banqueting House being full of goods and furniture
till the galleries on the garden-side, council chamber, and new chapel,
now in the building, were finished.They went to their audience in those
plain black gowns and caps which they constantly wear in the city of
Venice.I was invited to have accompanied the two Ambassadors in their
coach to supper that night, returning now to their own lodgings, as no
longer at the King's expense; but, being weary, I excused myself.My Lord Treasurer made me dine with him, where I
became acquainted with Monsieur Barillon, the French Ambassador, a
learned and crafty advocate.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th December, 1685.Turner, brother to the Bishop of Ely, and
sometime tutor to my son, preached at Whitehall on Mark viii.38,
concerning the submission of Christians to their persecutors, in which
were some passages indiscreet enough, considering the time, and the rage
of the inhuman French tyrant against the poor Protestants.Our patent for executing the office of Privy Seal
during the absence of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, being this day
sealed by the Lord Chancellor, we went afterward to St.James, where the
Court then was on occasion of building at Whitehall; his Majesty
delivered the seal to my Lord Tiviot and myself, the other Commissioners
not being come, and then gave us his hand to kiss.There were the two
Venetian Ambassadors and a world of company; among the rest the first
Popish Nuncio that had been in England since the Reformation; so
wonderfully were things changed, to the universal jealousy.We were all three Commissioners sworn on our knees
by the Clerk of the Crown, before my Lord Chancellor, three several
oaths: allegiance, supremacy, and the oath belonging to the Lord Privy
Seal, which last we took standing.After this, the Lord Chancellor
invited us all to dinner, but it being Christmas eve we desired to be
excused, intending at three in the afternoon to seal divers things which
lay ready at the office; so attended by three of the Clerks of the
Signet, we met and sealed.Among other things was a pardon to West, who
being privy to the late conspiracy, had revealed the accomplices to save
his own neck.There were also another pardon and two indenizations; and
so agreeing to a fortnight's vacation, I returned home.Recollecting the passages of the year past, and
having made up accounts, humbly besought Almighty God to pardon those my
sins which had provoked him to discompose my sorrowful family; that he
would accept of our humiliation, and in his good time restore comfort to
it.I also blessed God for all his undeserved mercies and preservations,
begging the continuance of his grace and preservation.The winter had
hitherto been extraordinarily wet and mild.Imploring the continuance of God's providential
care for the year now entered, I went to the public devotions.The Dean
of the Chapel and Clerk of the Closet put out, viz, Bishop of London and
..., and Rochester and Durham put in their places; the former had
opposed the toleration intended, and shown a worthy zeal for the
reformed religion as established.I dined with the Archbishop of York, where was Peter
Walsh, that Romish priest so well known for his moderation, professing
the Church of England to be a true member of the Catholic Church.He is
used to go to our public prayers without scruple, and did not
acknowledge the Pope's infallibility, only primacy of order.Passed the Privy Seal, among others, the creation of
Mrs.Sedley (concubine to ----) Countess of Dorchester, which the Queen
took very grievously, so as for two dinners, standing near her, I
observed she hardly ate one morsel, nor spoke one word to the King, or
to any about her, though at other times she used to be extremely
pleasant, full of discourse and good humor.The Roman Catholics were
also very angry: because they had so long valued the sanctity of their
religion and proselytes.Dryden, the famous playwriter, and his two sons, and Mrs.Nelly (miss to
the late ----), were said to go to mass; such proselytes were no great
loss to the Church.This night was burnt to the ground my Lord Montague's palace in
Bloomsbury, than which for painting and furniture there was nothing more
glorious in England.This happened by the negligence of a servant
airing, as they call it, some of the goods by the fire in a moist
season; indeed, so wet and mild a season had scarce been seen in man's
memory.At this Seal there also passed the creation of Sir Henry Waldegrave to
be a Peer.He had married one of the King's natural daughters by Mrs.These two Seals my brother Commissioners passed in the
morning before I came to town, at which I was not displeased.We
likewise passed Privy Seals for L276,000 upon several accounts,
pensions, guards, wardrobes, privy purse, etc., besides divers pardons,
and one more which I must not forget (and which by Providence I was not
present at) one Mr.Lytcott to be Secretary to the Ambassador to Rome.We being three Commissioners, any two were a quorum.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1686.I dined at my Lady Arlington's, Groom of the Stole
to the Queen Dowager, at Somerset House, where dined the Countesses of
Devonshire, Dover, etc.; in all eleven ladies of quality, no man but
myself being there.Unheard-of cruelties to the persecuted Protestants
of France, such as hardly any age has seen the like, even among the
Pagans.Being the day on which his Majesty began his reign,
by order of Council it was to be solemnized with a particular office and
sermon, which the Bishop of Ely preached at Whitehall on Numb.12; a
Court oration upon the regal office.It was much wondered at, that this
day, which was that of his late Majesty's death, should be kept as a
festival, and not the day of the present King's coronation.It is said
to have been formerly the custom, though not till now since the reign of
King James I.

The Duchess of Monmouth, being in the same seat with me at church,
appeared with a very sad and afflicted countenance.I took the test in Westminster Hall, before the Lord
Chief Justice.I now came to lodge at Whitehall, in the Lord Privy
Seal's lodgings.My great cause was heard by my Lord Chancellor, who
granted me a rehearing.I had six eminent lawyers, my antagonist three,
whereof one was the smooth-tongued solicitor, whom my Lord Chancellor
reproved in great passion for a very small occasion.Blessed be God for
his great goodness to me this day!Many bloody and notorious duels were fought about
this time.Stanley, brother to the Earl
of [Derby], indeed upon an almost insufferable provocation.It is to be
hoped that his Majesty will at last severely remedy this unchristian
custom.Lord Sunderland was now Secretary of State, President of the Council,
and Premier Minister.Came Sir Gilbert Gerrard to treat with me about his
son's marrying my daughter, Susanna.The father being obnoxious, and in
some suspicion and displeasure of the King, I would receive no proposal
till his Majesty had given me leave; which he was pleased to do; but,
after several meetings we broke off, on his not being willing to secure
anything competent for my daughter's children; besides that I found most
of his estate was in the coal-pits as far off as Newcastle, and on
leases from the Bishop of Durham, who had power to make concurrent
leases, with other difficulties.Frampton, Bishop of Gloucester, preached on Psalm
xliv.17, 18, 19, showing the several afflictions of the Church of
Christ from the primitive to this day, applying exceedingly to the
present conjuncture, when many were wavering in their minds, and great
temptations appearing through the favor now found by the <DW7>s, so as
the people were full of jealousies and discouragement.The Bishop
magnified the Church of England, exhorting to constancy and
perseverance.A Council of the Royal Society about disposing of Dr.Ray's book of Fishes, which was printed at the expense of the Society.A docket was to be sealed, importing a lease of
twenty-one years to one Hall, who styled himself his Majesty's printer
(he lately turned <DW7>) for the printing missals, offices, lives of
saints, portals, primers, etc., books expressly forbidden to be printed
or sold, by divers Acts of Parliament; I refused to put my seal to it,
making my exceptions, so it was laid by.The Bishop of Bath and Wells preached on John vi.17,
a most excellent and pathetic discourse: after he had recommended the
duty of fasting and other penitential duties, he exhorted to constancy
in the Protestant religion, detestation of the unheard-of cruelties of
the French, and stirring up to a liberal contribution.This sermon was
the more acceptable, as it was unexpected from a Bishop who had
undergone the censure of being inclined to Popery, the contrary whereof
no man could show more.This indeed did all our Bishops, to the
disabusing and reproach of all their delators: for none were more
zealous against Popery than they were.I was at a review of the army about London in Hyde
Park, about 6,000 horse and foot, in excellent order; his Majesty and
infinity of people being present.I went to my house in the country, refusing to be
present at what was to pass at the Privy Seal the next day.Tenison preached an incomparable discourse at Whitehall, on
Timothy ii.Cradock (Provost of Eaton) preached at the same
place, on Psalm xlix.13, showing the vanity of earthly enjoyments.White, Bishop of Peterborough, preached in a very
eloquent style, on Matthew xxvi.29, submission to the will of God on
all accidents, and at all times.The Duke of Northumberland (a natural son of the late
King by the Duchess of Cleveland) marrying very meanly, with the help of
his brother Grafton, attempted in vain to spirit away his wife.A Brief was read in all churches for relieving the French Protestants,
who came here for protection from the unheard-of cruelties of the King.Sir Edward Hales, a <DW7>, made Governor of Dover
Castle.The Archbishop of York now died of the smallpox, aged
62, a corpulent man.He was my special loving friend, and while Bishop
of Rochester (from whence he was translated) my excellent neighbor.He
was an inexpressible loss to the whole church, and that Province
especially, being a learned, wise, stout, and most worthy prelate; I
look on this as a great stroke to the poor Church of England, now in
this defecting period.In the afternoon I went to Camberwell, to visit Dr.After sermon, I accompanied him to his house, where he showed me
the Life and Letters of the late learned Primate of Armagh (Usher), and
among them that letter of Bishop Bramhall's to the Primate, giving
notice of the Popish practices to pervert this nation, by sending a
hundred priests into England, who were to conform themselves to all
sectaries and conditions for the more easily dispersing their doctrine
among us.This letter was the cause of the whole impression being
seized, upon pretense that it was a political or historical account of
things not relating to theology, though it had been licensed by the
Bishop; which plainly showed what an interest the <DW7>s now had,--that
a Protestant book, containing the life and letters of so eminent a man,
was not to be published.There were also many letters to and from most
of the learned persons his correspondents in Europe.The book will, I
doubt not, struggle through this unjust impediment.Several Judges were put out, and new complying ones put in.This day was read in our church the Brief for a
collection for relief of the Protestant French so cruelly, barbarously,
and inhumanly oppressed without any thing being laid to their charge.It
had been long expected, and at last with difficulty procured to be
published, the interest of the French Ambassador obstructing it.There being a Seal, it was feared we should be required
to pass a docket dispensing with Dr.Obadiah Walker and four more,
whereof one was an apostate curate of Putney, the others officers of
University College, Oxford, who hold their masterships, fellowships, and
cures, and keep public schools, and enjoy all former emoluments,
notwithstanding they no more frequented or used the public forms of
prayers, or communion, with the Church of England, or took the Test or
oaths of allegiance and supremacy, contrary to twenty Acts of
Parliament; which dispensation being also contrary to his Majesty's own
gracious declaration at the beginning of his reign, gave umbrage (as
well it might) to every good Protestant; nor could we safely have passed
it under the Privy Seal, wherefore it was done by immediate warrant,
signed by Mr.This Walker was a learned person, of a monkish life, to whose tuition I
had more than thirty years since recommended the sons of my worthy
friend, Mr.Hyldyard, of Horsley in Surrey, believing him to be far from
what he proved--a hypocritical concealed <DW7>--by which he perverted
the eldest son of Mr.Hyldyard, Sir Edward Hale's eldest son, and
several more, to the great disturbance of the whole nation, as well as
of the University, as by his now public defection appeared.All engines
being now at work to bring in Popery, which God in mercy prevent![Sidenote: LONDON]

This day was burned in the old Exchange, by the common hangman, a
translation of a book written by the famous Monsieur Claude, relating
only matters of fact concerning the horrid massacres and barbarous
proceedings of the French King against his Protestant subjects, without
any refutation of any facts therein; so mighty a power and ascendant
here had the French Ambassador, who was doubtless in great indignation
at the pious and truly generous charity of all the nation, for the
relief of those miserable sufferers who came over for shelter.About this time also, the Duke of Savoy, instigated by the French King
to extirpate the Protestants of Piedmont, slew many thousands of those
innocent people, so that there seemed to be an universal design to
destroy all that would not go to mass, throughout Europe._Quod Avertat
D. O.M.!_ No faith in Princes!I refused to put the Privy Seal to Doctor Walker's
license for printing and publishing divers Popish books, of which I
complained both to my Lord of Canterbury (with whom I went to advise in
the Council Chamber), and to my Lord Treasurer that evening at his
lodgings.My Lord of Canterbury's advice was, that I should follow my
own conscience therein; Mr.Treasurer's, that if in conscience I could
dispense with it, for any other hazard he believed there was none.Notwithstanding this, I persisted in my refusal.There was no sermon on this anniversary, as there
usually had been ever since the reign of the present King.Such storms, rain, and foul weather, seldom known at this
time of the year.The camp at Hounslow Heath, from sickness and other
inconveniences of weather, forced to retire to quarters; the storms
being succeeded by excessive hot weather, many grew sick.Great feasting
there, especially in Lord Dunbarton's quarters.There were many
jealousies and discourses of what was the meaning of this encampment.A seal this day; mostly pardons and discharges of Knight Baronets'
fees, which having been passed over for so many years, did greatly
disoblige several families who had served his Majesty.Lord Tyrconnel
gone to Ireland, with great powers and commissions, giving as much cause
of talk as the camp, especially nineteen new Privy-Councillors and
Judges being now made, among which but three Protestants, and Tyrconnel
made General.New judges also here, among which was Milton, a <DW7> (brother to that
Milton who wrote for the Regicides), who presumed to take his place
without passing the Test.Scotland refused to grant liberty of mass to
the <DW7>s there.The Protestants in Savoy
successfully resist the French dragoons sent to murder them.The King's chief physician in Scotland apostatizing from the Protestant
religion, does of his own accord publish his recantation at Edinburg.I went to see Middleton's receptacle of water at the
New River, and the New Spa Wells near.My Lord Treasurer settled my great business with Mr.Pretyman, to which I hope God will at last give a prosperous issue.Sharp and Tully,
proceeded to silence and suspend divers excellent divines for preaching
against Popery.I had this day been married thirty-nine years--blessed
be God for all his mercies!The new very young Lord Chief-Justice Herbert declared on the bench,
that the government of England was entirely in the King; that the Crown
was absolute; that penal laws were powers lodged in the Crown to enable
the King to force the execution of the law, but were not bars to bind
the King's power; that he could pardon all offenses against the law, and
forgive the penalties, and why could he not dispense with them; by which
the Test was abolished?Great jealousies as to
what would be the end of these proceedings.I supped with the Countess of Rochester, where was also
the Duchess of Buckingham and Madame de Governe, whose daughter was
married to the Marquis of Halifax's son.She made me a character of the
French King and Dauphin, and of the persecution; that they kept much of
the cruelties from the King's knowledge; that the Dauphin was so afraid
of his father, that he dared not let anything appear of his sentiments;
that he hated letters and priests, spent all his time in hunting, and
seemed to take no notice of what was passing.This lady was of a great family and fortune, and had fled hither for
refuge.I waited on the Archbishop at Lambeth, where I dined and
met the famous preacher and writer, Dr.Allix, doubtless a most
excellent and learned person.The Archbishop and he spoke Latin
together, and that very readily.Meggot, Dean of Winchester preached before the
household in St.George's Chapel at Windsor, the late King's glorious
chapel now seized on by the mass priests.Cartwright, Dean of Ripon,
preached before the great men of the Court in the same place.We had now the sad news of the Bishop of Oxford's death, an
extraordinary loss to the poor Church at this time.Many candidates for
his Bishopric and Deanery, Dr.Parker, South, Aldrich, etc.Walker
(now apostatizing) came to Court, and was doubtless very busy.Note, that standing by the Queen at basset (cards), I
observed that she was exceedingly concerned for the loss of L80; her
outward affability much changed to stateliness, since she has been
exalted.The season very rainy and inconvenient for the camps.Was sealed at our office the constitution of certain
commissioners to take upon them full power of all Ecclesiastical
affairs, in as unlimited a manner, or rather greater, than the late High
Commission-Court, abrogated by Parliament; for it had not only faculty
to inspect and visit all Bishops' dioceses, but to change what laws and
statutes they should think fit to alter among the colleges, though
founded by private men; to punish, suspend, fine, etc., give oaths and
call witnesses.The main drift was to suppress zealous preachers.In
sum, it was the whole power of a Vicar-General--note the consequence!Of
the clergy the commissioners were the Archbishop of Canterbury
[Sancroft], Bishop of Durham [Crewe], and Rochester [Sprat]; of the
Temporals, the Lord Treasurer, the Lord Chancellor [Jefferies] (who
alone was ever to be of the quorum), the Chief justice [Herbert], and
Lord President [Earl of Sunderland].I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Greenwich.[Sidenote: LONDON]

4th August, 1686.I dined at Signor Verrio's, the famous Italian
painter, now settled in his Majesty's garden at St.James's, which he
had made a very delicious paradise.Our vicar gone to dispose of his country living in
Rutlandshire, having St.Dunstan in the east given him by the Archbishop
of Canterbury.I went to visit the Marquis Ravigne, now my neighbor at Greenwich,
retired from the persecution in France.He was the deputy of all the
Protestants of that kingdom in the parliament of Paris, and several
times Ambassador in this and other Courts; a person of great learning
and experience.Compton, Bishop of London, was on Monday
suspended, on pretense of not silencing Dr.Giles's, for
something of a sermon in which he zealously reproved the doctrine of the
Roman Catholics.The Bishop having consulted the civilians, they told
him he could not by any law proceed against Dr.Sharp without producing
witnesses, and impleaded according to form; but it was overruled by my
Lord Chancellor, and the Bishop sentenced without so much as being heard
to any purpose.This was thought a very extraordinary way of proceeding,
and was universally resented, and so much the rather for that two
Bishops, Durham and Rochester, sitting in the commission and giving
their suffrages the Archbishop of Canterbury refused to sit among them.He was only suspended _ab officio_, and that was soon after taken off.He was brother to the Earl of Northampton, had once been a soldier, had
traveled in Italy, but became a sober, grave, and excellent prelate.Buda now taken from the Turks; a form of
thanksgiving was ordered to be used in the (as yet remaining) Protestant
chapels and church of Whitehall and Windsor.The King of Denmark was besieging Hamburg, no doubt by the French
contrivance, to embroil the Protestant Princes in a new war, that
Holland, etc., being engaged, matter for new quarrel might arise: the
unheard-of persecution of the poor Protestants still raging more than
ever.The Danes retire from Hamburg, the Protestant
Princes appearing for their succor, and the Emperor sending his
minatories to the King of Denmark, and also requiring the restoration of
the Duke of Saxe Gotha.Thus it pleased God to defeat the French
designs, which were evidently to kindle a new war.His Majesty's birthday; I was at his rising in his
bedchamber, afterward in the park, where four companies of guards were
drawn up.The officers, etc., wonderfully rich and gallant; they did not
head their troops, but their next officers, the colonels being on
horseback by the King while they marched.The ladies not less splendid
at Court, where there was a ball at night; but small appearance of
quality.All the shops both in the city and suburbs were shut up, and
kept as solemnly as any holiday.Bonfires at night in Westminster, but
forbidden in the city.Patrick, Dean of Peterborough, preached at
Covent Garden Church on Ephes.18, 19, showing the custom of the
primitive saints in serving God with hymns, and their frequent use of
them upon all occasions: touching the profane way of mirth and
intemperance of this ungodly age.Afterward I visited my Lord Chief
Justice of Ireland, with whom I had long and private discourse
concerning the miserable condition that kingdom was like to be in, if
Tyrconnel's counsel should prevail at Court.Went with the Countess of Sunderland to Cranbourne,
a lodge and walk of my Lord Godolphin's in Windsor park.There was one
room in the house spared in the pulling down the old one, because the
late Duchess of York was born in it; the rest was built and added to it
by Sir George Carteret, Treasurer of the Navy; and since, the whole was
purchased by my Lord Godolphin, who spoke to me to go see it, and advise
what trees were fit to be cut down to improve the dwelling, being
environed with old rotten pollards, which corrupt the air.It stands on
a knoll which though insensibly rising, gives it a prospect over the
Keep of Windsor, about three miles N. E. of it.The ground is clayey and
moist; the water stark naught; the park is pretty; the house tolerable,
and gardens convenient.After dinner, we came back to London, having two
coaches both going and coming, of six horses apiece, which we changed at
Hounslow.Warren preached before the Princess at
Whitehall, on 5th Matthew, of the blessedness of the pure in heart, most
elegantly describing the bliss of the beatifical vision.In the
afternoon, Sir George Wheeler, knight and baronet, preached on the 4th
Matt.Margaret's, an honest and
devout discourse, and pretty tolerably performed.This gentleman coming
from his travels out of Greece, fell in love with the daughter of Sir
Thomas Higgins, his Majesty's resident at Venice, niece to the Earl of
Bath, and married her.When they returned into England, being honored
with knighthood, he would needs turn preacher, and took orders.He
published a learned and ingenious book of his travels, and is a very
worthy person, a little formal and particular, but exceedingly devout.There was a triumphant show of the Lord Mayor both
by land and water, with much solemnity, when yet his power has been so
much diminished, by the loss of the city's former charter.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1686.Birch preached very boldly against the <DW7>s, from John xvi.Tillotson in Lincoln's Inn chapel, on the same
text, but more cautiously.I went with part of my family to pass the
melancholy winter in London at my son's house in Arundel Buildings.I dined at my Lady Arlington's, Groom of the Stole
to the Queen Dowager at Somerset House, where dined divers French
noblemen, driven out of their country by the persecution.I carried the Countess of Sunderland to see the
rarities of one Mr.Charlton in the Middle Temple, who showed us such a
collection as I had never seen in all my travels abroad either of
private gentlemen, or princes.It consisted of miniatures, drawings,
shells, insects, medals, natural things, animals (of which divers, I
think 100, were kept in glasses of spirits of wine), minerals, precious
stones, vessels, curiosities in amber, crystal, agate, etc.; all being
very perfect and rare of their kind, especially his books of birds,
fish, flowers, and shells, drawn and miniatured to the life.He told us
that one book stood him in L300; it was painted by that excellent
workman, whom the late Gaston, Duke of Orleans, employed.This
gentleman's whole collection, gathered by himself, traveling over most
parts of Europe, is estimated at L8,000.He appeared to be a modest and
obliging person.[62]

    [Footnote 62: This collection was afterward purchased by Sir Hans
    Sloane, and now forms part oL the British Museum.][Sidenote: LONDON]

29th December, 1686.I went to hear the music of the Italians in the
new chapel, now first opened publicly at Whitehall for the Popish
Service.Nothing can be finer than the magnificent marble work and
architecture at the end, where are four statues, representing St.Paul, and the Church, in white marble, the work of Mr.Gibbons, with all the carving and pillars of exquisite art and great
cost.The altar piece is the Salutation; the volto in _fresco_, the
Assumption of the blessed Virgin, according to their tradition, with our
blessed Savior, and a world of figures painted by Verrio.The throne
where the King and Queen sit is very glorious, in a closet above, just
opposite to the altar.Here we saw the Bishop in his mitre and rich
copes, with six or seven Jesuits and others in rich copes, sumptuously
habited, often taking off and putting on the Bishop's mitre, who sat in
a chair with arms pontifically, was adored and censed by three Jesuits
in their copes; then he went to the altar and made divers cringes, then
censing the images and glorious tabernacle placed on the altar, and now
and then changing place: the crosier, which was of silver, was put into
his hand with a world of mysterious ceremony, the music playing, with
singing.I could not have believed I should ever have seen such things
in the King of England's palace, after it had pleased God to enlighten
this nation; but our great sin has, for the present, eclipsed the
blessing, which I hope he will in mercy and his good time restore to its
purity.He wrote excellently, in answer
to the Bishop of Meaux.A Seal to confirm a gift of L4,000 per annum for 99
years to the Lord Treasurer out of the Post Office, and L1,700 per annum
for ever out of Lord Grey's estate.There was now another change of the great officers.The Treasury was put
into commission, two professed <DW7>s among them, viz, Lords Bellasis
and Dover, joined with the old ones, Lord Godolphin, Sir Stephen Fox,
and Sir John Ernley.Much expectation of several great men declaring
themselves <DW7>s.Lord Tyrconnel gone to succeed the Lord-Lieutenant
[Clarendon] in Ireland, to the astonishment of all sober men, and to the
evident ruin of the Protestants in that kingdom, as well as of its great
improvement going on.Much discourse that all the White Staff officers
and others should be dismissed for adhering to their religion.Popish
Justices of the Peace established in all counties, of the meanest of the
people; Judges ignorant of the law, and perverting it--so furiously do
the Jesuits drive, and even compel Princes to violent courses, and
destruction of an excellent government both in Church and State.God of
his infinite mercy open our eyes, and turn our hearts, and establish his
truth with peace!The Lord Jesus defend his little flock, and preserve
this threatened church and nation!I saw the Queen's new apartment at Whitehall, with
her new bed, the embroidery of which cost L3,000.The carving about the
chimney piece, by Gibbons, is incomparable.I heard the famous eunuch, Cifaccio, sing in the new
Popish chapel this afternoon; it was indeed very rare, and with great
skill.He came over from Rome, esteemed one of the best voices in Italy.Chetwin preached at Whitehall on Rom.18, a
very quaint, neat discourse of Moral righteousness.Came out a proclamation for universal liberty of
conscience in Scotland, and depensation from all tests and laws to the
contrary, as also capacitating <DW7>s to be chosen into all offices of
trust.Meggott, Dean of Winchester, preached before the
Princess of Denmark, on Matt.In the afternoon, I went out of
town to meet my Lord Clarendon, returning from Ireland.His Majesty sent for the Commissioners of the Privy
Seal this morning into his bedchamber, and told us that though he had
thought fit to dispose of the Seal into a single hand, yet he would so
provide for us, as it should appear how well he accepted our faithful
and loyal service with many gracious expressions to this effect; upon
which we delivered the Seal into his hands.It was by all the world both
hoped and expected, that he would have restored it to my Lord Clarendon;
but they were astonished to see it given to Lord Arundel, of Wardour, a
zealous Roman Catholic.Indeed it was very hard, and looked very
unkindly, his Majesty (as my Lord Clarendon protested to me, on my going
to visit him and long discoursing with him about the affairs of Ireland)
finding not the least failure of duty in him during his government of
that kingdom, so that his recall plainly appeared to be from the
stronger influence of the <DW7>s, who now got all the preferments.Most of the great officers, both in the Court and country, Lords and
others, were dismissed, as they would not promise his Majesty their
consent to the repeal of the test and penal statutes against Popish
Recusants.To this end, most of the Parliament men were spoken to in his
Majesty's closet, and such as refused, if in any place of office or
trust, civil or military, were put out of their employments.This was a
time of great trial; but hardly one of them assented, which put the
Popish interest much backward.The English clergy everywhere preached
boldly against their superstition and errors, and were wonderfully
followed by the people.Not one considerable proselyte was made in all
this time.The party were exceedingly put to the worst by the preaching
and writing of the Protestants in many excellent treatises, evincing the
doctrine and discipline of the reformed religion, to the manifest
disadvantage of their adversaries.To this did not a little contribute
the sermon preached at Whitehall before the Princess of Denmark and a
great crowd of people, and at least thirty of the greatest nobility, by
Dr.Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells, on John viii.46 (the Gospel of the
day), describing through his whole discourse the blasphemies, perfidy,
wresting of Scripture, preference of tradition before it, spirit of
persecution, superstition, legends, and fables of the Scribes and
Pharisees, so that all the auditory understood his meaning of a parallel
between them and the Romish priests, and their new Trent religion.He
exhorted his audience to adhere to the written Word, and to persevere in
the Faith taught in the Church of England, whose doctrine for Catholic
and soundness he preferred to all the communities and churches of
Christians in the world; concluding with a kind of prophecy, that
whatever it suffered, it should after a short trial emerge to the
confusion of her adversaries and the glory of God.I went this evening to see the order of the boys and children at
Christ's Hospital.There were near 800 boys and girls so decently clad,
cleanly lodged, so wholesomely fed, so admirably taught, some the
mathematics, especially the forty of the late King's foundation, that I
was delighted to see the progress some little youths of thirteen or
fourteen years of age had made.I saw them at supper, visited their
dormitories, and much admired the order, economy, and excellent
government of this most charitable seminary.Some are taught for the
Universities, others designed for seamen, all for trades and callings.The girls are instructed in all such work as becomes their sex and may
fit them for good wives, mistresses, and to be a blessing to their
generation.They sang a psalm before they sat down to supper in the
great Hall, to an organ which played all the time, with such cheerful
harmony, that it seemed to me a vision of angels.I came from the place
with infinite satisfaction, having never seen a more noble, pious, and
admirable charity.[63] The
foundation was of that pious Prince King Edward VI., whose picture (held
to be an original of Holbein) is in the court where the Governors meet
to consult on the affairs of the Hospital, and his statue in white
marble stands in a niche of the wall below, as you go to the church,
which is a modern, noble, and ample fabric.This foundation has had, and
still has, many benefactors.[Footnote 63: This is by no means the case now.]I saw a trial of those devilish, murdering, mischief
doing engines called bombs, shot out of the mortar piece on Blackheath.The distance that they are cast, the destruction they make where they
fall, is prodigious.Martin's to a crowd of people not to be expressed, nor the wonderful
eloquence of this admirable preacher; the text was Matt.36 to
verse 40, describing the bitterness of our Blessed Savior's agony, the
ardor of his love, the infinite obligations we have to imitate his
patience and resignation; the means by watching against temptations, and
over ourselves with fervent prayer to attain it, and the exceeding
reward in the end.Upon all which he made most pathetical discourses.The Communion followed, at which I was participant.Tenison's with the Bishop and that young, most learned, pious, and
excellent preacher, Mr.In the afternoon, I went to hear Mr.Wake
at the newly built church of St.34, upon the
subject of taking up the cross, and strenuously behaving ourselves in
time of persecution, as this now threatened to be.His Majesty again prorogued the Parliament, foreseeing it would not
remit the laws against <DW7>s, by the extraordinary zeal and bravery of
its members, and the free renunciation of the great officers both in
Court and state, who would not be prevailed with for any temporal
concern.During the service, a man came into near the middle of the
church, with his sword drawn, with several others in that posture; in
this jealous time it put the congregation into great confusion, but it
appeared to be one who fled for sanctuary, being pursued by bailiffs.I had a rehearing of my great cause at the Chancery in
Westminster Hall, having seven of the most learned Counsel, my adversary
five, among which were the Attorney General and late Solicitor Finch,
son to the Lord Chancellor Nottingham.The account was at last brought
to one article of the surcharge, and referred to a Master.The cause
lasted two hours and more.In the last week there was issued a Dispensation from
all obligations and tests, by which Dissenters and <DW7>s especially
had public liberty of exercising their several ways of worship, without
incurring the penalty of the many Laws and Acts of Parliament to the
contrary.This was purely obtained by the <DW7>s, thinking thereby to
ruin the Church of England, being now the only church which so admirably
and strenuously opposed their superstition.There was a wonderful
concourse of people at the Dissenters' meeting house in this parish, and
the parish church [Deptford] left exceedingly thin.What this will end
in, God Almighty only knows; but it looks like confusion, which I pray
God avert.[Sidenote: LONDON]

11th April, 1687.To London about my suit, some terms of accommodation
being proposed.I heard the famous singer, Cifaccio, esteemed the best
in Europe.Indeed, his holding out and delicateness in extending and
loosing a note with incomparable softness and sweetness, was admirable;
for the rest I found him a mere wanton, effeminate child, very coy, and
proudly conceited, to my apprehension.He touched the harpsichord to his
voice rarely well.This was before a select number of particular persons
whom Mr.Pepys invited to his house; and this was obtained by particular
favor and much difficulty, the Signor much disdaining to show his talent
to any but princes.At Greenwich, at the conclusion of the Church service,
there was a French sermon preached after the use of the English Liturgy
translated into French, to a congregation of about 100 French refugees,
of whom Monsieur Ruvigny was the chief, and had obtained the use of the
church, after the parish service was ended.The preacher pathetically
exhorted to patience, constancy, and reliance on God amidst all their
sufferings, and the infinite rewards to come.I dined with Mynheer Diskvelts, the Holland Ambassador, a
prudent and worthy person.There dined Lord Middleton, principal
Secretary of State, Lord Pembroke, Lord Lumley, Lord Preston, Colonel
Fitzpatrick, and Sir John Chardin.After dinner, the Ambassador
discoursed of and deplored the stupid folly of our politics, in
suffering the French to take Luxemburg, it being a place of the most
concern to have been defended, for the interest not only of the
Netherlands, but of England.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th May, 1687.Lord Sunderland being Lord President and
Secretary of State, was made Knight of the Garter and Prime favorite.This day there was such a storm of wind as had seldom happened, being a
sort of hurricane.It kept the flood out of the Thames, so that people
went on foot over several places above bridge.Also an earthquake in
several places in England about the time of the storm.Pretyman, after
my tedious suit.I went to London, it having pleased his Majesty to grant
me a Privy Seal for L6,000, for discharge of the debt I had been so many
years persecuted for, it being indeed for money drawn over by my
father-in-law, Sir R. Browne, during his residence in the Court of
France, and so with a much greater sum due to Sir Richard from his
Majesty; and now this part of the arrear being paid, there remains yet
due to me, as executor of Sir Richard, above L6,500 more; but this
determining an expensive Chancery suit has been so great a mercy and
providence to me (through the kindness and friendship to me of Lord
Godolphin, one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury,) that I do
acknowledge it with all imaginable thanks to my gracious God.I visited my Lady Pierpoint, daughter to Sir John
Evelyn, of Deane [in Wilts], now widow of Mr.Pierpoint, and mother of
the Earl of Kingston.She was now engaged in the marriage of my cousin,
Evelyn Pierpoint, her second son.There was about this time brought into the Downs a vast treasure, which
was sunk in a Spanish galleon about forty-five years ago, somewhere near
Hispaniola, or the Bahama islands, and was now weighed up by some
gentlemen, who were at the charge of divers, etc., to the enriching them
beyond all expectation.The Duke of Albemarle's share [Governor of
Jamaica] came to, I believe, L50,000.Some private gentlemen who
adventured L100, gained from L8,000 to L10,000.His Majesty's tenth was
L10,000.The Camp was now again pitched at Hounslow, the Commanders profusely
vying in the expense and magnificence of tents.21, upon the danger
of relapsing into sin.After this, I went and heard M. Lamot, an
eloquent French preacher at Greenwich, on Prov.8, 9, a consolatory
discourse to the poor and religious refugees who escaped out of France
in the cruel persecution.I went to Hampton Court to give his Majesty thanks for
his late gracious favor, though it was but granting what was due.While
I was in the Council Chamber, came in some persons, at the head of whom
was a formal man with a large roll of parchment in his hand, being an
ADDRESS (as he said, for he introduced it with a speech) of the people
of Coventry, giving his Majesty their great acknowledgments for his
granting a liberty of conscience; he added that this was not the
application of one party only, but the unanimous address of Church of
England men, Presbyterians, Independents, and Anabaptists, to show how
extensive his Majesty's grace was, as taking in all parties to his
indulgence and protection, which had removed all dissensions and
animosities, which would not only unite them in bonds of Christian
charity, but exceedingly encourage their future industry, to the
improvement of trade, and spreading his Majesty's glory throughout the
world; and that now he had given to God his empire, God would establish
his; with expressions of great loyalty and submission; and so he gave
the roll to the King, which being returned to him again, his Majesty
caused him to read.The address was short, but much to the substance of
the speech of their foreman, to whom the King, pulling off his hat, said
that what he had done in giving liberty of conscience, was, what was
ever his judgment ought to be done; and that, as he would preserve them
in their enjoyment of it during his reign, so he would endeavor to
settle it by law, that it should never be altered by his successors.After this, he gave them his hand to kiss.It was reported the
subscribers were above 1,000.But this is not so remarkable as an address of the week before (as I was
assured by one present), of some of the FAMILY OF LOVE, His Majesty
asked them what this worship consisted in, and how many their party
might consist of; they told him their custom was to read the Scripture,
and then to preach; but did not give any further account, only said that
for the rest they were a sort of refined Quakers, but their number very
small, not consisting, as they said, of above threescore in all, and
those chiefly belonging to the Isle of Ely.Blathwaite's (two miles from Hampton).This gentleman is Secretary of War, Clerk of the Council, etc., having
raised himself by his industry from very moderate circumstances.He is a
very proper, handsome person, very dexterous in business, and besides
all this, has married a great fortune.His income by the Army, Council,
and Secretary to the Committee of Foreign Plantations, brings him in
above L2,000 per annum.The Privy Seal for L6,000 was passed to me, so that this
tedious affair was dispatched.Hitherto, a very windy and tempestuous
summer.The French sermons to the refugees were continued at Greenwich
Church.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

19th July, 1687.In the way, I dined at Ashted, with
my Lady Mordaunt.I went to see Albury, now purchased by Mr.Finch (the
King's Solicitor and son to the late Lord Chancellor); I found the
garden which I first designed for the Duke of Norfolk, nothing improved.I went to visit Lord Clarendon at Swallowfield, where
was my Lord Cornbury just arrived from Denmark, whither he had
accompanied the Prince of Denmark two months before, and now come back.The miserable tyranny under which that nation lives, he related to us;
the King keeps them under an army of 40,000 men, all Germans, he not
daring to trust his own subjects.Notwithstanding this, the Danes are
exceedingly proud, the country very poor and miserable.Returned home to Sayes Court from Wotton, having been
five weeks absent with my brother and friends, who entertained us very
nobly.God be praised for his goodness, and this refreshment after my
many troubles, and let his mercy and providence ever preserve me.The Lord Mayor sent me an Officer with a staff, to
be one of the Governors of St.PERSECUTION RAGING IN FRANCE; divers churches there fired by lightning,
priests struck, consecrated hosts, etc., burnt and destroyed, both at
St.Malos and Paris, at the grand procession on Corpus Christi day.I went to Lambeth, and dined with the Archbishop.After dinner, I retired into the library, which I found exceedingly
improved; there are also divers rare manuscripts in a room apart.I was godfather to Sir John Chardin's son, christened
at Greenwich Church, named John.The Earl of Bath and Countess of
Carlisle, the other sponsors.An Anabaptist, a very odd ignorant person, a
mechanic, I think, was Lord Mayor.The King and Queen, and Dadi, the
Pope's Nuncio, invited to a feast at Guildhall.A strange turn of
affairs, that those who scandalized the Church of England as favorers of
Popery, should publicly invite an emissary from Rome, one who
represented the very person of their Antichrist!My son was returned out of Devon, where he had been
on a commission from the Lords of the Treasury about a concealment of
land.I went with my Lord Chief-Justice Herbert, to see
his house at Walton-on-Thames: it is a barren place.To a very ordinary
house he had built a very handsome library, designing more building to
it than the place deserves, in my opinion.He desired my advice about
laying out his gardens, etc.The next day, we went to Weybridge, to see
some pictures of the Duchess of Norfolk's, particularly the statue, or
child in gremio, said to be of Michael Angelo; but there are reasons to
think it rather a copy, from some proportion in the figures ill taken.Slingsby, Master of the Mint, being under
very deplorable circumstances on account of his creditors, and
especially the King, I did my endeavor with the Lords of the Treasury to
be favorable to him.My Lord Arran, eldest son to the Duke of Hamilton, being now married to
Lady Ann Spencer, eldest daughter of the Earl of Sunderland, Lord
President of the Council, I and my family had most glorious favors sent
us, the wedding being celebrated with extraordinary splendor.There was a solemn and particular office used at
our, and all the churches of London and ten miles round, for a
thanksgiving to God, for her Majesty being with child.This afternoon I went not to church, being employed
on a religious treatise I had undertaken._Post annum 1588--1660--1688, Annus Mirabilis Tertius._[64]

    [Footnote 64: This seems to have been added after the page was
    written.]Being the Martyrdom day of King Charles I., our
curate made a florid oration against the murder of that excellent
Prince, with an exhortation to obedience from the example of David; 1
Samuel xxvi.[Sidenote: LONDON]

12th February, 1688.My daughter Evelyn going in the coach to visit in
the city, a jolt (the door being not fast shut) flung her quite out in
such manner, as the hind wheels passed over her a little above her
knees.Yet it pleased God, besides the bruises of the wheels, she had no
other harm.In two days she was able to walk, and soon after perfectly
well; through God Almighty's great mercy to an excellent wife and a most
dutiful and discreet daughter-in-law.I received the sad news of my niece Montague's
death at Woodcot on the 15th.I gave in my account about the sick and wounded, in
order to have my quietus.Parker, Bishop of Oxford, who so lately published
his extravagant treatise about transubstantiation, and for abrogating
the test and penal laws, died.He was esteemed a violent, passionate,
haughty man, but yet being pressed to declare for the Church of Rome, he
utterly refused it.The French TYRANT now finding he could make no proselytes among those
Protestants of quality, and others, whom he had caused to be shut up in
dungeons, and confined to nunneries and monasteries, gave them, after so
long trial, a general releasement, and leave to go out of the kingdom,
but utterly taking their estates and their children; so that great
numbers came daily into England and other places, where they were
received and relieved with very considerate Christian charity.This
Providence and goodness of God to those who thus constantly held out,
did so work upon those miserable poor souls who, to avoid the
persecution, signed their renunciation, and to save their estates went
to mass, that reflecting on what they had done, they grew so affected in
their conscience, that not being able to support it, they in great
numbers through all the French provinces, acquainted the magistrates and
lieutenants that being sorry for their apostacy, they were resolved to
return to their old religion; that they would go no more to mass, but
peaceably assemble when they could, to beg pardon and worship God, but
so without weapons as not to give the least umbrage of rebellion or
sedition, imploring their pity and commiseration; and, accordingly,
meeting so from time to time, the dragoon-missioners, Popish officers
and priests, fell upon them, murdered and put them to death, whoever
they could lay hold on; they without the least resistance embraced
death, torture, or hanging, with singing psalms and praying for their
persecutors to the last breath, yet still continuing the former
assembling of themselves in desolate places, suffering with incredible
constancy, that through God's mercy they might obtain pardon for this
lapse.Such examples of Christian behavior have not been seen since the
primitive persecutions; and doubtless God will do some signal work in
the end, if we can with patience and resignation hold out, and depend on
his Providence.I went with Sir Charles Littleton to Sheen, a house
and estate given him by Lord Brounker; one who was ever noted for a
hard, covetous, vicious man; but for his worldly craft and skill in
gaming few exceeded him.Coming to die, he bequeathed all his land,
house, furniture, etc., to Sir Charles, to whom he had no manner of
relation, but an ancient friendship contracted at the famous siege of
Colchester, forty years before.It is a pretty place, with fine gardens,
and well planted, and given to one worthy of them, Sir Charles being an
honest gentleman and soldier.He is brother to Sir Henry Littleton of
Worcestershire, whose great estate he is likely to inherit, his brother
being without children.They are descendants of the great lawyer of that
name, and give the same arms and motto.Temple, formerly maid of honor to the late Queen, a beautiful lady, and
he has many fine children, so that none envy his good fortune.After dinner, we went to see Sir William Temple's near to it; the
most remarkable things are his orangery and gardens, where the
wall-fruit-trees are most exquisitely nailed and trained, far better
than I ever noted.There are many good pictures, especially of Vandyke's, in both these
houses, and some few statues and small busts in the latter.From thence to Kew, to visit Sir Henry Capel's, whose orangery and
_myrtetum_ are most beautiful and perfectly well kept.He was contriving
very high palisadoes of reeds to shade his oranges during the summer,
and painting those reeds in oil.[Sidenote: LONDON]

1st April, 1688.In the morning, the first sermon was by Dr.Paul's (at Whitehall), on Luke x.The
Holy Communion followed, but was so interrupted by the rude breaking in
of multitudes zealous to hear the second sermon, to be preached by the
Bishop of Bath and Wells, that the latter part of that holy office could
hardly be heard, or the sacred elements be distributed without great
trouble.The Princess being come, he preached on Mich.8, 9, 10,
describing the calamity of the Reformed Church of Judah under the
Babylonian persecution, for her sins, and God's delivery of her on her
repentance; that as Judah emerged, so should the now Reformed Church,
whenever insulted and persecuted.He preached with his accustomed
action, zeal, and energy, so that people flocked from all quarters to
hear him.A dry, cold, backward spring; easterly winds.The persecution still raging in France, multitudes of Protestants, and
many very considerable and great persons flying hither, produced a
second general contribution, the <DW7>s, by God's Providence, as yet
making small progress among us.The weather was, till now, so cold and sharp, by an
almost perpetual east wind, which had continued many months, that there
was little appearance of any spring, and yet the winter was very
favorable as to frost and snow.To London, about my petition for allowances upon the
account of Commissioner for Sick and Wounded in the former war with
Holland.His Majesty, alarmed by the great fleet of the Dutch
(while we had a very inconsiderable one), went down to Chatham; their
fleet was well prepared, and out, before we were in any readiness, or
had any considerable number to have encountered them, had there been
occasion, to the great reproach of the nation; while being in profound
peace, there was a mighty land army, which there was no need of, and no
force at sea, where only was the apprehension; but the army was
doubtless kept and increased, in order to bring in and countenance
Popery, the King beginning to discover his intention, by many instances
pursued by the Jesuits, against his first resolution to alter nothing in
the Church Establishment, so that it appeared there can be no reliance
on Popish promises.The King enjoining the ministers to read his
Declaration for giving liberty of conscience (as it was styled) in all
churches of England, this evening, six Bishops, Bath and Wells,[65]
Peterborough,[66] Ely,[67] Chichester,[68] St.Asaph,[69] and
Bristol,[70] in the name of all the rest of the Bishops, came to his
Majesty to petition him, that he would not impose the reading of it to
the several congregations within their dioceses; not that they were
averse to the publishing it for want of due tenderness toward
dissenters, in relation to whom they should be willing to come to such a
temper as should be thought fit, when that matter might be considered
and settled in Parliament and Convocation; but that, the Declaration
being founded on such a dispensing power as might at pleasure set aside
all laws ecclesiastical and civil, it appeared to them illegal, as it
had done to the Parliament in 1661 and 1672, and that it was a point of
such consequence, that they could not so far make themselves parties to
it, as the reading of it in church in time of divine service amounted
to.[Footnote 70: Sir John Trelawny, Bart.]The King was so far incensed at this address, that he with threatening
expressions commanded them to obey him in reading it at their perils,
and so dismissed them.[Sidenote: LONDON]

20th May, 1688.I went to Whitehall Chapel, where, after the morning
lessons, the Declaration was read by one of the choir who used to read
the chapters.I hear it was in the Abbey Church, Westminster, but almost
universally forborne throughout all London: the consequences of which a
little time will show.All the discourse now was about the Bishops refusing to
read the injunction for the abolition of the Test, etc.It seems the
injunction came so crudely from the Secretary's office, that it was
neither sealed nor signed in form, nor had any lawyer been consulted, so
as the Bishops who took all imaginable advice, put the Court to great
difficulties how to proceed against them.Great were the consults, and a
proclamation was expected all this day; but nothing was done.The action
of the Bishops was universally applauded, and reconciled many adverse
parties, <DW7>s only excepted, who were now exceedingly perplexed, and
violent courses were every moment expected.Report was, that the
Protestant secular Lords and Nobility would abet the Clergy.The Queen Dowager, hitherto bent on her return into Portugal, now on the
sudden, on allegation of a great debt owing her by his Majesty disabling
her, declares her resolution to stay.News arrived of the most prodigious earthquake that was almost ever
heard of, subverting the city of Lima and country in Peru, with a
dreadful inundation following it.This day, the Archbishop of Canterbury, with the
Bishops of Ely, Chichester, St.Asaph, Bristol, Peterborough, and Bath
and Wells, were sent from the Privy Council prisoners to the Tower, for
refusing to give bail for their appearance, on their not reading the
Declaration for liberty of conscience; they refused to give bail, as it
would have prejudiced their peerage.The concern of the people for them
was wonderful, infinite crowds on their knees begging their blessing,
and praying for them, as they passed out of the barge along the Tower
wharf.A YOUNG PRINCE born, which will cause disputes.About two o'clock, we heard the Tower ordnance discharged, and the bells
ring for the birth of a Prince of Wales.This was very surprising, it
having been universally given out that her Majesty did not look till the
next month.I went to the Tower to see the Bishops, visited the
Archbishop and the Bishops of Ely, St.Being the first day of term, the Bishops were brought
to Westminster on habeas corpus, when the indictment was read, and they
were called on to plead; their counsel objected that the warrant was
illegal; but, after long debate, it was overruled, and they pleaded.The
Court then offered to take bail for their appearance; but this they
refused, and at last were dismissed on their own recognizances to appear
that day fortnight; the Archbishop in L200, the Bishops in L100 each.Was a day of thanksgiving in London and ten miles about
for the young Prince's birth; a form of prayer made for the purpose by
the Bishop of Rochester.They appeared; the trial lasted from nine in the
morning to past six in the evening, when the jury retired to consider of
their verdict, and the Court adjourned to nine the next morning.The
jury were locked up till that time, eleven of them being for an
acquittal; but one (Arnold, a brewer) would not consent.At length he
agreed with the others.The Chief Justice, Wright, behaved with great
moderation and civility to the Bishops.Alibone, a <DW7>, was strongly
against them; but Holloway and Powell being of opinion in their favor,
they were acquitted.When this was heard, there was great rejoicing; and
there was a lane of people from the King's Bench to the water side, on
their knees, as the Bishops passed and repassed, to beg their blessing.Bonfires were made that night, and bells rung, which was taken very ill
at Court, and an appearance of nearly sixty Earls and Lords, etc., on
the bench, did not a little comfort them; but indeed they were all along
full of comfort and cheerful.Note, they denied to pay the Lieutenant of the Tower (Hales, who used
them very surlily), any fees, alleging that none were due.The night was solemnized with bonfires, and other fireworks, etc.The two judges, Holloway and Powell, were displaced.Godolphin and his brother Sir William to
St.Alban's, to see a library he would have bought of the widow of Dr.Cartwright, late Archdeacon of St.Alban's, a very good collection of
books, especially in divinity; he was to give L300 for them.Having seen
the GREAT CHURCH, now newly repaired by a public contribution, we
returned home.One of the King's chaplains preached before the Princess
on Exodus xiv.13, "Stand still, and behold the salvation of the Lord,"
which he applied so boldly to the present conjuncture of the Church of
England, that more could scarce be said to encourage desponders.The
Popish priests were not able to carry their cause against their learned
adversaries, who confounded them both by their disputes and writings.The camp now began at Hounslow, but the nation was in
high discontent.Colonel Titus, Sir Henry Vane (son of him who was executed for his
treason), and some other of the Presbyterians and Independent party,
were sworn of the Privy Council, from hopes of thereby diverting that
party from going over to the Bishops and Church of England, which now
they began to do, foreseeing the design of the <DW7>s to descend and
take in their most hateful of heretics (as they at other times expressed
them to be) to effect their own ends, now evident; the utter extirpation
of the Church of England first, and then the rest would follow.This night the fireworks were played off, that had been
prepared for the Queen's upsitting.We saw them to great advantage; they
were very fine, and cost some thousands of pounds, in the pyramids,
statues, etc., but were spent too soon for so long a preparation.I went to Lambeth to visit the Archbishop, whom I
found very cheerful.Tenison now told me there would suddenly be some
great thing discovered.This was the Prince of Orange intending to come
over.I went to Althorpe, in Northamptonshire, seventy
miles.A coach and four horses took up me and my son at Whitehall, and
carried us to Dunstable, where we arrived and dined at noon, and from
thence another coach and six horses carried us to Althorpe, four miles
beyond Northampton, where we arrived by seven o'clock that evening.Both
these coaches were hired for me by that noble Countess of Sunderland,
who invited me to her house at Althorpe, where she entertained me and my
son with very extraordinary kindness; I stayed till the Thursday.Jeffryes, the minister of Althorpe, who was my
Lord's chaplain when ambassador in France, preached the shortest
discourse I ever heard; but what was defective in the amplitude of his
sermon, he had supplied in the largeness and convenience of the
parsonage house, which the doctor (who had at least L600 a year in
spiritual advancement) had newly built, and made fit for a person of
quality to live in, with gardens and all accommodation according
therewith.My lady carried us to see Lord Northampton's Seat, a very strong, large
house, built with stone, not altogether modern.They were enlarging the
garden, in which was nothing extraordinary, except the iron gate opening
into the park, which indeed was very good work, wrought in flowers
painted with blue and gilded.There is a noble walk of elms toward the
front of the house by the bowling green.I was not in any room of the
house besides a lobby looking into the garden, where my Lord and his new
Countess (Sir Stephen Fox's daughter, whom I had known from a child)
entertained the Countess and her daughter the Countess of Arran (newly
married to the son of the Duke of Hamilton), with so little good grace,
and so dully, that our visit was very short, and so we returned to
Althorpe, twelve miles distant.[Sidenote: ALTHORPE]

The house, or rather palace, at Althorpe, is a noble uniform pile in
form of a half H, built of brick and freestone, balustered and _a la
moderne_; the hall is well, the staircase excellent; the rooms of state,
galleries, offices and furniture, such as may become a great prince.It
is situated in the midst of a garden, exquisitely planted and kept, and
all this in a park walled in with hewn stone, planted with rows and
walks of trees, canals and fish ponds, and stored with game.And, what
is above all this, governed by a lady, who without any show of
solicitude, keeps everything in such admirable order, both within and
without, from the garret to the cellar, that I do not believe there is
any in this nation, or in any other, that exceeds her in such exact
order, without ostentation, but substantially great and noble.The
meanest servant is lodged so neat and cleanly; the service at the
several tables, the good order and decency--in a word, the entire
economy is perfectly becoming a wise and noble person.She is one who
for her distinguished esteem of me from a long and worthy friendship, I
must ever honor and celebrate.I wish from my soul the Lord, her husband
(whose parts and abilities are otherwise conspicuous), was as worthy of
her, as by a fatal apostasy and court-ambition he has made himself
unworthy!This is what she deplores, and it renders her as much
affliction as a lady of great soul and much prudence is capable of.The
Countess of Bristol, her mother, a grave and honorable lady, has the
comfort of seeing her daughter and grandchildren under the same economy,
especially Mr.Charles Spencer, a youth of extraordinary hopes, very
learned for his age, and ingenious, and under a governor of great worth.Happy were it, could as much be said of the elder brother, the Lord
Spencer, who, rambling about the world, dishonors both his name and his
family, adding sorrow to sorrow to a mother, who has taken all
imaginable care of his education.There is a daughter very young married
to the Earl of Clancarty, who has a great and fair estate in Ireland,
but who yet gives no great presage of worth,--so universally
contaminated is the youth of this corrupt and abandoned age!But this is
again recompensed by my Lord Arran, a sober and worthy gentleman, who
has espoused the Lady Ann Spencer, a young lady of admirable
accomplishments and virtue.I left this noble place and conversation, my lady
having provided carriages to convey us back in the same manner as we
went, and a dinner being prepared at Dunstable against our arrival.Northampton, having been lately burned and re-edified, is now become a
town that for the beauty of the buildings, especially the church and
townhouse, may compare with the neatest in Italy itself.Sprat, Bishop of Rochester, wrote a very honest and handsome letter
to the Commissioners Ecclesiastical, excusing himself from sitting any
longer among them, he by no means approving of their prosecuting the
Clergy who refused to read the Declaration for liberty of conscience, in
prejudice of the Church of England.The Dutch make extraordinary preparations both at sea and land, which
with no small progress Popery makes among us, puts us to many
difficulties.The Popish Irish soldiers commit many murders and insults;
the whole nation disaffected, and in apprehensions.After long trials of the doctors to bring up the little Prince of Wales
by hand (so many of her Majesty's children having died infants) not
succeeding, a country nurse, the wife of a tile maker, is taken to give
it suck.I went to London, where I found the Court in the
utmost consternation on report of the Prince of Orange's landing; which
put Whitehall into so panic a fear, that I could hardly believe it
possible to find such a change.Writs were issued in order to a Parliament, and a declaration to back
the good order of elections, with great professions of maintaining the
Church of England, but without giving any sort of satisfaction to the
people, who showed their high discontent at several things in the
Government.Earthquakes had utterly demolished the ancient Smyrna, and several other
places in Greece, Italy, and even in the Spanish Indies, forerunners of
greater calamities.God Almighty preserve his Church and all who put
themselves under the shadow of his wings, till these things be
overpassed.The Court in so extraordinary a consternation, on
assurance of the Prince of Orange's intention to land, that the writs
sent forth for a Parliament were recalled.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th October, 1688.16, showing the Scriptures to be our only rule of faith, and its
perfection above all traditions.After which, near 1,000 devout persons
partook of the Communion.The sermon was chiefly occasioned by a Jesuit,
who in the Masshouse on the Sunday before had disparaged the Scripture
and railed at our translation, which some present contradicting, they
pulled him out of the pulpit, and treated him very coarsely, insomuch
that it was like to create a great disturbance in the city.Hourly expectation of the Prince of Orange's invasion heightened to that
degree, that his Majesty thought fit to abrogate the Commission for the
dispensing Power (but retaining his own right still to dispense with all
laws) and restore the ejected Fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford.In
the meantime, he called over 5,000 Irish, and 4,000 Scots, and continued
to remove Protestants and put in <DW7>s at Portsmouth and other places
of trust, and retained the Jesuits about him, increasing the universal
discontent.It brought people to so desperate a pass, that they seemed
passionately to long for and desire the landing of that Prince, whom
they looked on to be their deliverer from Popish tyranny, praying
incessantly for an east wind, which was said to be the only hindrance of
his expedition with a numerous army ready to make a descent.To such a
strange temper, and unheard of in former times, was this poor nation
reduced, and of which I was an eyewitness.The apprehension was (and
with reason) that his Majesty's forces would neither at land nor sea
oppose them with that vigor requisite to repel invaders.The late imprisoned Bishops were now called to reconcile matters, and
the Jesuits hard at work to foment confusion among the Protestants by
their usual tricks.A letter was sent to the Archbishop of
Canterbury,[71] informing him, from good hands, of what was contriving
by them.A paper of what the Bishops advised his Majesty was published.The Bishops were enjoined to prepare a form of prayer against the feared
invasion.The letter was as follows:--

    "My Lord, The honor and reputation which your Grace's piety,
    prudence, and signal courage, have justly merited and obtained, not
    only from the sons of the Church of England, but even universally
    from those Protestants among us who are Dissenters from her
    discipline; God Almighty's Providence and blessing upon your Grace's
    vigilancy and extraordinary endeavors will not suffer to be
    diminished in this conjuncture.The conversation I now and then have
    with some in place who have the opportunity of knowing what is doing
    in the most secret recesses and cabals of our Church's adversaries,
    obliges me to acquaint you, that the calling of your Grace and the
    rest of the Lords Bishops to Court, and what has there of late been
    required of you, is only to create a jealousy and suspicion among
    well-meaning people of such compliances, as it is certain they have
    no cause to apprehend.The plan of this and of all that which is to
    follow of seeming favor thence, is wholly drawn by the Jesuits, who
    are at this time more than ever busy to make divisions among us, all
    other arts and mechanisms having hitherto failed them.They have,
    with other things contrived that your Lordships the Bishops should
    give his Majesty advice separately, without calling any of the rest
    of the Peers, which, though maliciously suggested, spreads generally
    about the town.I do not at all question but your Grace will
    speedily prevent the operation of this venom, and that you will
    think it highly necessary so to do, that your Grace is also enjoined
    to compose a form of prayer, wherein the Prince of Orange is
    expressly to be named the Invader: of this I presume not to say
    anything; but for as much as in all the Declarations, etc., which
    have hitherto been published in pretended favor of the Church of
    England, there is not once the least mention of the REFORMED or
    PROTESTANT RELIGION, but only of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND AS BY LAW
    ESTABLISHED, which Church the <DW7>s tell us is the CHURCH OF ROME,
    which is (say they) the Catholic Church of England--that only is
    established by Law; the Church of England in the REFORMED sense so
    established, is but by an usurped authority.The antiquity of THAT
    would by these words be explained, and utterly defeat this false and
    subdolous construction, and take off all exceptions whatsoever; if,
    in all extraordinary offices, upon these occasions, the words
    REFORMED and PROTESTANT were added to that of the CHURCH OF ENGLAND
    BY LAW ESTABLISHED.And whosoever threatens to invade or come
    against us, to the prejudice of that Church, in God's name, be they
    Dutch or Irish, let us heartily pray and fight against them.My
    Lord, this is, I confess, a bold, but honest period; and, though I
    am well assured that your Grace is perfectly acquainted with all
    this before, and therefore may blame my impertinence, as that does
    [Greek: allotrioepiskopein]; yet I am confident you will not reprove
    the zeal of one who most humbly begs your Grace's pardon, with your
    blessing.(From a copy in Evelyn's
    handwriting.)This day signal for the victory
of William the Conqueror against Harold, near Battel, in Sussex.The
wind, which had been hitherto west, was east all this day.Wonderful
expectation of the Dutch fleet.Public prayers ordered to be read in the
churches against invasion.A tumult in London on the rabble demolishing a
Popish chapel that had been set up in the city.Lady Sunderland acquainted me with his Majesty's
taking away the Seals from Lord Sunderland, and of her being with the
Queen to intercede for him.It is conceived that he had of late grown
remiss in pursuing the interest of the Jesuitical counsels; some
reported one thing, some another; but there was doubtless some secret
betrayed, which time may discover.There was a Council called, to which were summoned the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the Judges, the Lord Mayor, etc.The Queen Dowager, and all
the ladies and lords who were present at the Queen Consort's labor, were
to give their testimony upon oath of the Prince of Wales's birth,
recorded both at the Council Board and at the Chancery a day or two
after.This procedure was censured by some as below his Majesty to
condescend to, on the talk of the people.It was remarkable that on this
occasion the Archbishop, Marquis of Halifax, the Earls of Clarendon and
Nottingham, refused to sit at the Council table among <DW7>s, and their
bold telling his Majesty that whatever was done while such sat among
them was unlawful and incurred _praemunire_;--at least, if what I heard
be true.I dined with Lord Preston, made Secretary of State,
in the place of the Earl of Sunderland.Boyle, when came in the Duke of Hamilton and Earl of
Burlington.The Duke told us many particulars of Mary Queen of Scots,
and her amours with the Italian favorite, etc.My birthday, being the 68th year of my age.O
blessed Lord, grant that as I grow in years, so may I improve in grace!Be thou my protector this following year, and preserve me and mine from
those dangers and great confusions that threaten a sad revolution to
this sinful nation!Defend thy church, our holy religion, and just laws,
disposing his Majesty to listen to sober and healing counsels, that if
it be thy blessed will, we may still enjoy that happy tranquility which
hitherto thou hast continued to us!Dined with Lord Preston, with other company, at Sir
Stephen Fox's.Continual alarms of the Prince of Orange, but no
certainty.Reports of his great losses of horse in the storm, but
without any assurance.A man was taken with divers papers and printed
manifestoes, and carried to Newgate, after examination at the Cabinet
Council.There was likewise a declaration of the States for satisfaction
of all public ministers at The Hague, except to the English and the
French.There was in that of the Prince's an expression, as if the Lords
both spiritual and temporal had invited him over, with a deduction of
the causes of his enterprise.This made his Majesty convene my Lord of
Canterbury and the other Bishops now in town, to give an account of what
was in the manifesto, and to enjoin them to clear themselves by some
public writing of this disloyal charge.It was now certainly reported by some who saw the
fleet, and the Prince embark, that they sailed from the Brill on
Wednesday morning, and that the Princess of Orange was there to take
leave of her husband.Fresh reports of the Prince being landed somewhere
about Portsmouth, or the Isle of Wight, whereas it was thought it would
have been northward.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th November, 1688.I went to London; heard the news of the Prince
having landed at Torbay, coming with a fleet of near 700 sail, passing
through the Channel with so favorable a wind, that our navy could not
intercept, or molest them.This put the King and Court into great
consternation, they were now employed in forming an army to stop their
further progress, for they were got into Exeter, and the season and ways
very improper for his Majesty's forces to march so great a distance.The Archbishop of Canterbury and some few of the other Bishops and
Lords in London, were sent for to Whitehall, and required to set forth
their abhorrence of this invasion.They assured his Majesty that they
had never invited any of the Prince's party, or were in the least privy
to it, and would be ready to show all testimony of their loyalty; but,
as to a public declaration, being so few, they desired that his Majesty
would call the rest of their brethren and Peers, that they might consult
what was fit to be done on this occasion, not thinking it right to
publish anything without them, and till they had themselves seen the
Prince's manifesto, in which it was pretended he was invited in by the
Lords, spiritual and temporal.This did not please the King; so they
departed.A declaration was published, prohibiting all persons to see or read the
Prince's manifesto, in which was set forth at large the cause of his
expedition, as there had been one before from the States.These are the beginnings of sorrow, unless God in his mercy prevent it
by some happy reconciliation of all dissensions among us.This, in all
likelihood, nothing can effect except a free Parliament; but this we
cannot hope to see, while there are any forces on either side.I pray
God to protect and direct the King for the best and truest interest of
his people!--I saw his Majesty touch for the evil, Piten the Jesuit, and
Warner officiating.Lord Cornbury carries some regiments, and marches to
Honiton, the Prince's headquarters.The city of London in disorder; the
rabble pulled down the nunnery newly bought by the <DW7>s of Lord
Berkeley, at St.The Queen prepares to go to Portsmouth for
safety, to attend the issue of this commotion, which has a dreadful
aspect.The King goes to
Salisbury to rendezvous the army, and return to London.Lord Delamere
appears for the Prince in Cheshire.The
Archbishop of Canterbury and some Bishops, and such Peers as were in
London, address his Majesty to call a Parliament.The King invites all
foreign nations to come over.The French take all the Palatinate, and
alarm the Germans more than ever.We adjourned the
election of a President to 23d of April, by reason of the public
commotions, yet dined together as of custom this day.Afterward, visited my Lord Godolphin, then going with the Marquis of
Halifax and Earl of Nottingham as Commissioners to the Prince of Orange;
he told me they had little power.Bath, York, Hull, Bristol, and all the eminent nobility and persons of
quality through England, declare for the Protestant religion and laws,
and go to meet the Prince, who every day sets forth new Declarations
against the <DW7>s.The great favorites at Court, Priests and Jesuits,
fly or abscond.Everything, till now concealed, flies abroad in public
print, and is cried about the streets.Expectation of the Prince coming
to Oxford.The Prince of Wales and great treasure sent privily to
Portsmouth, the Earl of Dover being Governor.Address from the Fleet not
grateful to his Majesty.The <DW7>s in offices lay down their
commissions, and fly.Universal consternation among them; it looks like
a revolution.The rabble
demolished all Popish chapels, and several <DW7> lords and gentlemen's
houses, especially that of the Spanish Ambassador, which they pillaged,
and burned his library.The King flies to sea, puts in at Faversham for
ballast; is rudely treated by the people; comes back to Whitehall.The Prince of Orange is advanced to Windsor, is invited by the King to
St.James's, the messenger sent was the Earl of Faversham, the General
of the Forces, who going without trumpet, or passport, is detained
prisoner by the Prince, who accepts the invitation, but requires his
Majesty to retire to some distant place, that his own guards may be
quartered about the palace and city.This is taken heinously and the
King goes privately to Rochester; is persuaded to come back; comes on
the Sunday; goes to mass, and dines in public, a Jesuit saying grace (I
was present).That night was a Council; his Majesty refuses to
assent to all the proposals; goes away again to Rochester.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th December, 1688.I saw the King take barge to Gravesend at twelve
o'clock--a sad sight!James's, and fills
Whitehall with Dutch guards.A Council of Peers meet about an expedient
to call a Parliament; adjourn to the House of Lords.The Chancellor,
Earl of Peterborough, and divers others taken.The Earl of Sunderland
flies; Sir Edward Hale, Walker, and others, taken and secured.All the world go to see the Prince at St.James's, where there is a
great Court.There I saw him, and several of my acquaintance who came
over with him.He is very stately, serious and reserved.The English
soldiers sent out of town to disband them; not well pleased.The King passes into France, whither the Queen and
child were gone a few days before.The Peers and such Commoners as were members of the
Parliament at Oxford, being the last of Charles II.meeting, desire the
Prince of Orange to take on him the disposal of the public revenue till
a convention of Lords and Commons should meet in full body, appointed by
his circular letters to the shires and boroughs, 22d of January.I had
now quartered upon me a Lieutenant-Colonel and eight horses.This day prayers for the Prince of Wales were first
left off in our Church.A long frost and deep snow; the Thames almost
frozen over.I visited the Archbishop of Canterbury, where I
found the Bishops of St.Asaph, Ely, Bath and Wells, Peterborough, and
Chichester, the Earls of Aylesbury and Clarendon, Sir George Mackenzie,
Lord-Advocate of Scotland, and then came in a Scotch Archbishop, etc.After prayers and dinner, divers serious matters were discoursed,
concerning the present state of the Public, and sorry I was to find
there was as yet no accord in the judgments of those of the Lords and
Commons who were to convene; some would have the Princess made Queen
without any more dispute, others were for a Regency; there was a Tory
party (then so called), who were for inviting his Majesty again upon
conditions; and there were Republicans who would make the Prince of
Orange like a Stadtholder.The Romanists were busy among these several
parties to bring them into confusion: most for ambition or other
interest, few for conscience and moderate resolutions.I found nothing
of all this in this assembly of Bishops, who were pleased to admit me
into their discourses; they were all for a Regency, thereby to salve
their oaths, and so all public matters to proceed in his Majesty's name,
by that to facilitate the calling of Parliament, according to the laws
in being.My Lord of Canterbury gave me great thanks for the advertisement I sent
him in October, and assured me they took my counsel in that particular,
and that it came very seasonably.I found by the Lord-Advocate that the Bishops of Scotland (who were
indeed little worthy of that character, and had done much mischief in
that Church) were now coming about to the true interest, in this
conjuncture which threatened to abolish the whole hierarchy in that
kingdom; and therefore the Scottish Archbishop and Lord-Advocate
requested the Archbishop of Canterbury to use his best endeavors with
the Prince to maintain the Church there in the same state, as by law at
present settled.It now growing late, after some private discourse with his Grace, I took
my leave, most of the Lords being gone.The great convention being assembled the day before, falling upon the
question about the government, resolved that King James having by the
advice of the Jesuits and other wicked persons endeavored to subvert the
laws of the Church and State, and deserted the kingdom, carrying away
the seals, etc., without any care for the management of the government,
had by demise abdicated himself and wholly vacated his right; they did
therefore desire the Lords' concurrence to their vote, to place the
crown on the next heir, the Prince of Orange, for his life, then to the
Princess, his wife, and if she died without issue, to the Princess of
Denmark, and she failing, to the heirs of the Prince, excluding forever
all possibility of admitting a Roman Catholic.[Sidenote: LONDON]

27th January, 1689.I dined at the Admiralty, where was brought in a
child not twelve years old, the son of one Dr.Clench, of the most
prodigious maturity of knowledge, for I cannot call it altogether
memory, but something more extraordinary.Pepys and myself examined
him, not in any method, but with promiscuous questions, which required
judgment and discernment to answer so readily and pertinently.There was
not anything in chronology, history, geography, the several systems of
astronomy, courses of the stars, longitude, latitude, doctrine of the
spheres, courses and sources of rivers, creeks, harbors, eminent cities,
boundaries and bearings of countries, not only in Europe, but in any
other part of the earth, which he did not readily resolve and
demonstrate his knowledge of, readily drawing out with a pen anything he
would describe.He was able not only to repeat the most famous things
which are left us in any of the Greek or Roman histories, monarchies,
republics, wars, colonies, exploits by sea and land, but all the sacred
stories of the Old and New Testament; the succession of all the
monarchies, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, Roman, with all the lower
Emperors, Popes, Heresiarchs, and Councils, what they were called about,
what they determined, or in the controversy about Easter, the tenets of
the Gnostics, Sabellians, Arians, Nestorians; the difference between St.Cyprian and Stephen about re-baptism, the schisms.We leaped from that
to other things totally different, to Olympic years, and synchronisms;
we asked him questions which could not be resolved without considerable
meditation and judgment, nay of some particulars of the Civil Laws, of
the Digest and Code.He gave a stupendous account of both natural and
moral philosophy, and even in metaphysics.Having thus exhausted ourselves rather than this wonderful child, or
angel rather, for he was as beautiful and lovely in countenance as in
knowledge, we concluded with asking him if, in all he had read or heard
of, he had ever met with anything which was like this expedition of the
Prince of Orange, with so small a force to obtain three great kingdoms
without any contest.After a little thought, he told us that he knew of
nothing which did more resemble it than the coming of Constantine the
Great out of Britain, through France and Italy, so tedious a march, to
meet Maxentius, whom he overthrew at Pons Milvius with very little
conflict, and at the very gates of Rome, which he entered and was
received with triumph, and obtained the empire, not of three kingdoms
only, but of all the then known world.He was perfect in the Latin
authors, spoke French naturally, and gave us a description of France,
Italy, Savoy, Spain, ancient and modernly divided; as also of ancient
Greece, Scythia, and northern countries and tracts: we left questioning
further.He did this without any set or formal repetitions, as one who
had learned things without book, but as if he minded other things, going
about the room, and toying with a parrot there, and as he was at dinner
(_tanquam aliua agens_, as it were) seeming to be full of play, of a
lively, sprightly temper, always smiling, and exceedingly pleasant,
without the least levity, rudeness, or childishness.His father assured us he never imposed anything to charge his memory by
causing him to get things by heart, not even the rules of grammar; but
his tutor (who was a Frenchman) read to him, first in French, then in
Latin; that he usually played among other boys four or five hours every
day, and that he was as earnest at his play as at his study.He was
perfect in arithmetic, and now newly entered into Greek.In sum
(_horresco referens_), I had read of divers forward and precocious
youths, and some I have known, but I never did either hear or read of
anything like to this sweet child, if it be right to call him child who
has more knowledge than most men in the world.I counseled his father
not to set his heart too much on this jewel,

    "_Immodicis brevis est aetas, et rara senectus,_"

as I myself learned by sad experience in my most dear child Richard,
many years since, who, dying before he was six years old, was both in
shape and countenance and pregnancy of learning, next to a prodigy.The votes of the House of Commons being carried up
by Mr.Hampden, their chairman, to the Lords, I got a station by the
Prince's lodgings at the door of the lobby to the House, and heard much
of the debate, which lasted very long.Lord Derby was in the chair (for
the House was resolved into a grand committee of the whole House); after
all had spoken, it came to the question, which was carried by three
voices against a Regency, which 51 were for, 54 against; the minority
alleging the danger of dethroning Kings, and scrupling many passages and
expressions in the vote of the Commons, too long to set down
particularly.Some were for sending to his Majesty with conditions:
others that the King could do no wrong, and that the maladministration
was chargeable on his ministers.There were not more than eight or nine
bishops, and but two against the Regency; the archbishop was absent, and
the clergy now began to change their note, both in pulpit and discourse,
on their old passive obedience, so as people began to talk of the
bishops being cast out of the House.In short, things tended to
dissatisfaction on both sides; add to this, the morose temper of the
Prince of Orange, who showed little countenance to the noblemen and
others, who expected a more gracious and cheerful reception when they
made their court.The English army also was not so in order, and firm to
his interest, nor so weakened but that it might give interruption.Ireland was in an ill posture as well as Scotland.Nothing was yet done
toward a settlement.God of his infinite mercy compose these things,
that we may be at last a Nation and a Church under some fixed and sober
establishment!'s MARTYRDOM; but
in all the public offices and pulpit prayers, the collects, and litany
for the King and Queen were curtailed and mutilated.Sharp preached
before the Commons, but was disliked, and not thanked for his sermon.At our church (the next day being appointed a
thanksgiving for deliverance by the Prince of Orange, with prayers
purposely composed), our lecturer preached in the afternoon a very
honest sermon, showing our duty to God for the many signal deliverances
of our Church, without touching on politics.The King's coronation day was ordered not to be
observed, as hitherto it had been.The Convention of the Lords and Commons now declare the Prince and
Princess of Orange King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland
(Scotland being an independent kingdom), the Prince and Princess being
to enjoy it jointly during their lives; but the executive authority to
be vested in the Prince during life, though all proceedings to run in
both names, and that it should descend to their issue, and for want of
such, to the Princess Anne of Denmark and her issue, and in want of
such, to the heirs of the body of the Prince, if he survive, and that
failing, to devolve to the Parliament, as they should think fit.These
produced a conference with the Lords, when also there was presented
heads of such new laws as were to be enacted.It is thought on these
conditions they will be proclaimed.There was much contest about the King's abdication, and whether he had
vacated the government.The Earl of Nottingham and about twenty Lords,
and many Bishops, entered their protests, but the concurrence was great
against them.Forces sending to Ireland, that kingdom
being in great danger by the Earl of Tyrconnel's army, and expectations
from France coming to assist them, but that King was busy in invading
Flanders, and encountering the German Princes.It is likely that this
will be the most remarkable summer for action, which has happened in
many years.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st February, 1689.James's on the
obligation to walk worthy of God's particular and signal deliverance of
the nation and church.I saw the NEW QUEEN and KING proclaimed the very next day after her
coming to Whitehall, Wednesday, 13th February, with great acclamation
and general good reception.It was believed
that both, especially the Princess, would have shown some (seeming)
reluctance at least, of assuming her father's crown, and made some
apology, testifying by her regret that he should by his mismanagement
necessitate the nation to so extraordinary a proceeding, which would
have shown very handsomely to the world, and according to the character
given of her piety; consonant also to her husband's first declaration,
that there was no intention of deposing the King, but of succoring the
nation; but nothing of all this appeared; she came into Whitehall
laughing and jolly, as to a wedding, so as to seem quite transported.She rose early the next morning, and in her undress, as it was reported,
before her women were up, went about from room to room to see the
convenience of Whitehall; lay in the same bed and apartment where the
late Queen lay, and within a night or two sat down to play at basset, as
the Queen, her predecessor used to do.She smiled upon and talked to
everybody, so that no change seemed to have taken place at Court since
her last going away, save that infinite crowds of people thronged to see
her, and that she went to our prayers.She seems to be of a good nature, and that she takes nothing to
heart: while the Prince, her husband, has a thoughtful countenance, is
wonderfully serious and silent, and seems to treat all persons alike
gravely, and to be very intent on affairs: Holland, Ireland, and France
calling for his care.Divers Bishops and Noblemen are not at all satisfied with this so sudden
assumption of the Crown, without any previous sending, and offering some
conditions to the absent King; or on his not returning, or not assenting
to those conditions, to have proclaimed him Regent; but the major part
of both Houses prevailed to make them King and Queen immediately, and a
crown was tempting.This was opposed and spoken against with such
vehemence by Lord Clarendon (her own uncle), that it put him by all
preferment, which must doubtless have been as great as could have been
given him.My Lord of Rochester, his brother, overshot himself, by the
same carriage and stiffness, which their friends thought they might have
well spared when they saw how it was like to be overruled, and that it
had been sufficient to have declared their dissent with less passion,
acquiescing in due time.The Archbishop of Canterbury and some of the rest, on scruple of
conscience and to salve the oaths they had taken, entered their protests
and hung off, especially the Archbishop, who had not all this while so
much as appeared out of Lambeth.This occasioned the wonder of many who
observed with what zeal they contributed to the Prince's expedition, and
all the while also rejecting any proposals of sending again to the
absent King; that they should now raise scruples, and such as created
much division among the people, greatly rejoicing the old courtiers, and
especially the <DW7>s.Another objection was, the invalidity of what was done by a convention
only, and the as yet unabrogated laws; this drew them to make themselves
on the 22d [February] a Parliament, the new King passing the act with
the crown on his head.The lawyers disputed, but necessity prevailed,
the government requiring a speedy settlement.Innumerable were the crowds, who solicited for, and expected offices;
most of the old ones were turned out.Two or three white staves were
disposed of some days before, as Lord Steward, to the Earl of
Devonshire; Treasurer of the household, to Lord Newport; Lord
Chamberlain to the King, to my Lord of Dorset; but there were as yet
none in offices of the civil government save the Marquis of Halifax as
Privy Seal.A council of thirty was chosen, Lord Derby president, but
neither Chancellor nor Judges were yet declared, the new Great Seal not
yet finished.Tillotson, Dean of Canterbury, made an excellent
discourse on Matt.44, exhorting to charity and forgiveness of
enemies; I suppose purposely, the new Parliament being furious about
impeaching those who were obnoxious, and as their custom has ever been,
going on violently, without reserve, or modification, while wise men
were of opinion the most notorious offenders being named and excepted,
an Act of Amnesty would be more seasonable, to pacify the minds of men
in so general a discontent of the nation, especially of those who did
not expect to see the government assumed without any regard to the
absent King, or proving a spontaneous abdication, or that the birth of
the Prince of Wales was an imposture; five of the Bishops also still
refusing to take the new oath.In the meantime, to gratify the people, the hearth-tax was remitted
forever; but what was intended to supply it, besides present great taxes
on land, is not named.The King abroad was now furnished by the French King with money and
officers for an expedition to Ireland.The great neglect in not more
timely preventing that from hence, and the disturbances in Scotland,
give apprehensions of great difficulties, before any settlement can be
perfected here, while the Parliament dispose of the great offices among
themselves.The Great Seal, Treasury and Admiralty put into commission
of many unexpected persons, to gratify the more; so that by the present
appearance of things (unless God Almighty graciously interpose and give
success in Ireland and settle Scotland) more trouble seems to threaten
the nation than could be expected.In the interim, the new King refers
all to the Parliament in the most popular manner, but is very slow in
providing against all these menaces, besides finding difficulties in
raising men to send abroad; the former army, which had never seen any
service hitherto, receiving their pay and passing their summer in an
idle scene of a camp at Hounslow, unwilling to engage, and many
disaffected, and scarce to be trusted.[Sidenote: LONDON]

29th March, 1689.The new King much blamed for neglecting Ireland, now
likely to be ruined by the Lord Tyrconnel and his Popish party, too
strong for the Protestants.Wonderful uncertainty where King James was,
whether in France or Ireland.The Scots seem as yet to favor King
William, rejecting King James's letter to them, yet declaring nothing
positively.Parliament preparing the
coronation oath.Presbyterians and Dissenters displeased at the vote for
preserving the Protestant religion as established by law, without
mentioning what they were to have as to indulgence.The Archbishop of Canterbury and four other Bishops refusing to come to
Parliament, it was deliberated whether they should incur _Praemunire_;
but it was thought fit to let this fall, and be connived at, for fear of
the people, to whom these Prelates were very dear, for the opposition
they had given to Popery.Things far from settled as was expected, by reason of
the slothful, sickly temper of the new King, and the Parliament's
unmindfulness of Ireland, which is likely to prove a sad omission.The Confederates beat the French out of the Palatinate, which they had
most barbarously ruined.I saw the procession to and from the Abbey Church of
Westminster, with the great feast in Westminster Hall, at the coronation
of King William and Queen Mary.What was different from former
coronations, was some alteration in the coronation oath.Burnet, now
made Bishop of Sarum, preached with great applause.The Parliament men
had scaffolds and places which took up the one whole side of the Hall.When the King and Queen had dined, the ceremony of the Champion, and
other services by tenure were performed.The Parliament men were feasted
in the Exchequer chamber, and had each of them a gold medal given them,
worth five-and-forty shillings.On the one side were the effigies of the
King and Queen inclining one to the other; on the reverse was Jupiter
throwing a bolt at Phaeton the words, "_Ne totus absumatur_": which was
but dull, seeing they might have had out of the poet something as
apposite.Much of the splendor of the proceeding was abated by the absence of
divers who should have contributed to it, there being but five Bishops,
four Judges (no more being yet sworn), and several noblemen and great
ladies wanting; the feast, however, was magnificent.The next day the
House of Commons went and kissed their new Majesties' hands in the
Banqueting House.Asaph to visit my Lord
of Canterbury at Lambeth, who had excused himself from officiating at
the coronation, which was performed by the Bishop of London, assisted by
the Archbishop of York.We had much private and free discourse with his
Grace concerning several things relating to the Church, there being now
a bill of comprehension to be brought from the Lords to the Commons.I
urged that when they went about to reform some particulars in the
Liturgy, Church discipline, Canons, etc., the baptizing in private
houses without necessity might be reformed, as likewise so frequent
burials in churches; the one proceeding much from the pride of women,
bringing that into custom which was only indulged in case of imminent
danger, and out of necessity during the rebellion, and persecution of
the clergy in our late civil wars; the other from the avarice of
ministers, who, in some opulent parishes, made almost as much of
permission to bury in the chancel and the church, as of their livings,
and were paid with considerable advantage and gifts for baptizing in
chambers.To this they heartily assented, and promised their endeavor to
get it reformed, utterly disliking both practices as novel and indecent.We discoursed likewise of the great disturbance and prejudice it might
cause, should the new oath, now on the anvil, be imposed on any, save
such as were in new office, without any retrospect to such as either had
no office, or had been long in office, who it was likely would have some
scruples about taking a new oath, having already sworn fidelity to the
government as established by law.This we all knew to be the case of my
Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, and some other persons who were not so
fully satisfied with the Convention making it an abdication of King
James, to whom they had sworn allegiance.King James was now certainly in Ireland with the Marshal d'Estrades,
whom he made a Privy Councillor; and who caused the King to remove the
Protestant Councillors, some whereof, it seems, had continued to sit,
telling him that the King of France, his master, would never assist him
if he did not immediately do it; by which it is apparent how the poor
Prince is managed by the French.Scotland declares for King William and Queen Mary, with the reasons of
their setting aside King James, not as abdicating, but forfeiting his
right by maladministration; they proceeded with much more caution and
prudence than we did, who precipitated all things to the great reproach
of the nation, all which had been managed by some crafty, ill-principled
men.The new Privy Council have a Republican spirit, manifestly
undermining all future succession of the Crown and prosperity of the
Church of England, which yet I hope they will not be able to accomplish
so soon as they expect, though they get into all places of trust and
profit.This was one of the most seasonable springs, free from
the usual sharp east winds that I have observed since the year 1660 (the
year of the Restoration), which was much such an one.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26th April, 1689.I heard the lawyers plead before the Lords the writ
of error in the judgment of Oates, as to the charge against him of
perjury, which after debate they referred to the answer of Holloway,
etc., who were his judges.Asaph to
the Archbishop at Lambeth, where they entered into discourse concerning
the final destruction of Antichrist, both concluding that the third
trumpet and vial were now pouring out.Asaph considered the
killing of the two witnesses, to be the utter destruction of the
Cevennes Protestants by the French and Duke of Savoy, and the other the
Waldenses and Pyrenean Christians, who by all appearance from good
history had kept the primitive faith from the very Apostles' time till
now.The doubt his Grace suggested was, whether it could be made evident
that the present persecution had made so great a havoc of those faithful
people as of the other, and whether there were not yet some among them
in being who met together, it being stated from the text, Apoc.xi.,
that they should both be slain together.Mede's way of interpretation, and that he only failed in resolving too
hastily on the King of Sweden's (Gustavus Adolphus) success in Germany.They agreed that it would be good to employ some intelligent French
minister to travel as far as the Pyrenees to understand the present
state of the Church there, it being a country where hardly anyone
travels.There now came certain news that King James had not only landed in
Ireland, but that he had surprised Londonderry, and was become master of
that kingdom, to the great shame of our government, who had been so
often solicited to provide against it by timely succor, and which they
might so easily have done.This is a terrible beginning of more
troubles, especially should an army come thence into Scotland, people
being generally disaffected here and everywhere else, so that the seamen
and landmen would scarce serve without compulsion.A new oath was now fabricating for all the clergy to take, of obedience
to the present Government, in abrogation of the former oaths of
allegiance, which it is foreseen many of the bishops and others of the
clergy will not take.The penalty is to be the loss of their dignity and
spiritual preferment.This is thought to have been driven on by the
Presbyterians, our new governors.God in mercy send us help, and direct
the counsels to his glory and good of his Church!Public matters went very ill in Ireland: confusion and dissensions among
ourselves, stupidity, inconstancy, emulation, the governors employing
unskillful men in greatest offices, no person of public spirit and
ability appearing,--threaten us with a very sad prospect of what may be
the conclusion, without God's infinite mercy.A fight by Admiral Herbert with the French, he imprudently setting on
them in a creek as they were landing men in Ireland, by which we came
off with great slaughter and little honor--so strangely negligent and
remiss were we in preparing a timely and sufficient fleet.The Scots
Commissioners offer the crown to the NEW KING AND QUEEN on
conditions.--Act of Poll-money came forth, sparing none.--Now appeared
the Act of Indulgence for the Dissenters, but not exempting them from
paying dues to the Church of England clergy, or serving in office
according to law, with several other clauses.--A most splendid embassy
from Holland to congratulate the King and Queen on their accession to
the crown.A solemn fast for success of the fleet, etc.I dined with the Bishop of Asaph; Monsieur Capellus, the
learned son of the most learned Ludovicus, presented to him his father's
works, not published till now.I visited the Archbishop of Canterbury, and stayed with
him till about seven o'clock.He read to me the Pope's excommunication
of the French King.Burnet, now Bishop of Sarum; got him to let
Mr.King James's declaration was now dispersed, offering
pardon to all, if on his landing, or within twenty days after, they
should return to their obedience.Our fleet not yet at sea, through some prodigious sloth, and men minding
only their present interest; the French riding masters at sea, taking
many great prizes to our wonderful reproach.No certain news from
Ireland; various reports of Scotland; discontents at home.The King of
Denmark at last joins with the Confederates, and the two Northern Powers
are reconciled.The East India Company likely to be dissolved by
Parliament for many arbitrary actions.Oates acquitted of perjury, to
all honest men's admiration.News of A PLOT discovered, on which divers were sent to
the Tower and secured.An extraordinary drought, to the threatening of great
wants as to the fruits of the earth.Pepys,
late Secretary to the Admiralty, holding my "Sylva" in my right hand.It
was on his long and earnest request, and is placed in his library.Kneller never painted in a more masterly manner.I dined at Lord Clarendon's, it being his lady's
wedding day, when about three in the afternoon there was an unusual and
violent storm of thunder, rain, and wind; many boats on the Thames were
overwhelmed, and such was the impetuosity of the wind as to carry up the
waves in pillars and spouts most dreadful to behold, rooting up trees
and ruining some houses.The Countess of Sunderland afterward told me
that it extended as far as Althorpe at the very time, which is seventy
miles from London.It did no harm at Deptford, but at Greenwich it did
much mischief.I went to Hampton Court about business, the Council
being there.A great apartment and spacious garden with fountains was
beginning in the park at the head of the canal.The Marshal de Schomberg went now as General toward
Ireland, to the relief of Londonderry.The
Confederates passing the Rhine, besiege Bonn and Mayence, to obtain a
passage into France.A great victory gotten by the Muscovites, taking
and burning Perecop.A new rebel against the Turks threatens the
destruction of that tyranny.All Europe in arms against France, and
hardly to be found in history so universal a face of war.The Convention (or Parliament as some called it) sitting, exempt the
Duke of Hanover from the succession to the crown, which they seem to
confine to the present new King, his wife, and Princess Anne of Denmark,
who is so monstrously swollen, that it is doubted whether her being
thought with child may prove a TYMPANY only, so that the unhappy family
of the Stuarts seems to be extinguishing; and then what government is
likely to be next set up is unknown, whether regal and by election, or
otherwise, the Republicans and Dissenters from the Church of England
evidently looking that way.The Scots have now again voted down Episcopacy there.Great discontents
through this nation at the slow proceedings of the King, and the
incompetent instruments and officers he advances to the greatest and
most necessary charges.Hitherto it has been a most seasonable summer.Londonderry relieved after a brave and wonderful holding out.I went to visit the Archbishop of Canterbury since
his suspension, and was received with great kindness.A dreadful fire
happened in Southwark.Came to visit us the Marquis de Ruvigne, and one
Monsieur le Coque, a French refugee, who left great riches for his
religion; a very learned, civil person; he married the sister of the
Duchess de la Force.Ottobone, a Venetian Cardinal, eighty years old,
made Pope.[72]

    [Footnote 72: Peter Otthobonus succeeded Innocent XI.as Pope in
    1689, by the title of Alexander VIII.]My birthday, being now sixty-nine years old.Blessed
Father, who hast prolonged my years to this great age, and given me to
see so great and wonderful revolutions, and preserved me amid them to
this moment, accept, I beseech thee, the continuance of my prayers and
thankful acknowledgments, and grant me grace to be working out my
salvation and redeeming the time, that thou mayst be glorified by me
here, and my immortal soul saved whenever thou shalt call for it, to
perpetuate thy praises to all eternity, in that heavenly kingdom where
there are no more changes or vicissitudes, but rest, and peace, and joy,
and consummate felicity, forever.Grant this, O heavenly Father, for the
sake of Jesus thine only Son and our Savior.Asaph, Lord Almoner, preached
before the King and Queen, the whole discourse being an historical
narrative of the Church of England's several deliverances, especially
that of this anniversary, signalized by being also the birthday of the
Prince of Orange, his marriage (which was on the 4th), and his landing
at Torbay this day.There was a splendid ball and other rejoicings.After a very wet season, the winter came on
severely.Much wet, without frost, yet the wind north and
easterly.A Convocation of the Clergy meet about a reformation of our
Liturgy, Canons, etc., obstructed by others of the clergy.[Sidenote: LONDON]

27th November, 1689.I went to London with my family, to winter at Soho,
in the great square.This night there was a most extraordinary storm
of wind, accompanied with snow and sharp weather; it did great harm in
many places, blowing down houses, trees, etc., killing many people.It
began about two in the morning, and lasted till five, being a kind of
hurricane, which mariners observe have begun of late years to come
northward.This winter has been hitherto extremely wet, warm, and windy.Ann's Church an exhortatory
letter to the clergy of London from the Bishop, together with a Brief
for relieving the distressed Protestants, and Vaudois, who fled from the
persecution of the French and Duke of Savoy, to the Protestant Cantons
of Switzerland.The Parliament was unexpectedly prorogued to 2d of April to the
discontent and surprise of many members who, being exceedingly averse to
the settling of anything, proceeding with animosities, multiplying
exceptions against those whom they pronounced obnoxious, and producing
as universal a discontent against King William and themselves, as there
was before against King James.The new King resolved on an expedition
into Ireland in person.About 150 of the members who were of the more
royal party, meeting at a feast at the Apollo Tavern near St.Dunstan's,
sent some of their company to the King, to assure him of their service;
he returned his thanks, advising them to repair to their several
counties and preserve the peace during his absence, and assuring them
that he would be steady to his resolution of defending the Laws and
Religion established.The great Lord suspected to have counselled this
prorogation, universally denied it.However, it was believed the chief
adviser was the Marquis of Carmarthen, who now seemed to be most in
favor.The Parliament was dissolved by proclamation, and
another called to meet the 20th of March.This was a second surprise to
the former members; and now the Court party, or, as they call
themselves, Church of England, are making their interests in the
country.The Marquis of Halifax lays down his office of Privy Seal, and
pretends to retire.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th February, 1690.The Duchess of Monmouth's chaplain preached at St.Martin's an excellent discourse exhorting to peace and sanctity, it
being now the time of very great division and dissension in the nation;
first, among the Churchmen, of whom the moderate and sober part were for
a speedy reformation of divers things, which it was thought might be
made in our Liturgy, for the inviting of Dissenters; others more stiff
and rigid, were for no condescension at all.Books and pamphlets were
published every day pro and con; the Convocation were forced for the
present to suspend any further progress.There was fierce and great
carousing about being elected in the new Parliament.The King persists
in his intention of going in person for Ireland, whither the French are
sending supplies to King James, and we, the Danish horse to Schomberg.I dined with the Marquis of Carmarthen (late Lord
Danby), where was Lieutenant-General Douglas, a very considerate and
sober commander, going for Ireland.He related to us the exceeding
neglect of the English soldiers, suffering severely for want of clothes
and necessaries this winter, exceedingly magnifying their courage and
bravery during all their hardships.There dined also Lord Lucas,
Lieutenant of the Tower, and the Bishop of St.The Privy Seal was
again put in commission, Mr.Cheny (who married my kinswoman, Mrs.Pierrepoint), Sir Thomas Knatchbull, and Sir P. W. Pultney.The
imprudence of both sexes was now become so great and universal, persons
of all ranks keeping their courtesans publicly, that the King had lately
directed a letter to the Bishops to order their clergy to preach against
that sin, swearing, etc., and to put the ecclesiastical laws in
execution without any indulgence.I went to Kensington, which King William had bought
of Lord Nottingham, and altered, but was yet a patched building, but
with the garden, however, it is a very sweet villa, having to it the
park and a straight new way through this park.Pepys, late Secretary to the
Admiralty, where was that excellent shipwright and seaman (for so he had
been, and also a Commission of the Navy), Sir Anthony Deane.Among other
discourse, and deploring the sad condition of our navy, as now governed
by inexperienced men since this Revolution, he mentioned what exceeding
advantage we of this nation had by being the first who built frigates,
the first of which ever built was that vessel which was afterward called
"The Constant Warwick," and was the work of Pett of Chatham, for a trial
of making a vessel that would sail swiftly; it was built with low decks,
the guns lying near the water, and was so light and swift of sailing,
that in a short time he told us she had, ere the Dutch war was ended,
taken as much money from privateers as would have laden her; and that
more such being built, did in a year or two scour the Channel from those
of Dunkirk and others which had exceedingly infested it.He added that
it would be the best and only infallible expedient to be masters of the
sea, and able to destroy the greatest navy of any enemy if, instead of
building huge great ships and second and third rates, they would leave
off building such high decks, which were for nothing but to gratify
gentlemen-commanders, who must have all their effeminate accommodations,
and for pomp; that it would be the ruin of our fleets, if such persons
were continued in command, they neither having experience nor being
capable of learning, because they would not submit to the fatigue and
inconvenience which those who were bred seamen would undergo, in those
so otherwise useful swift frigates.These being to encounter the
greatest ships would be able to protect, set on, and bring off, those
who should manage the fire ships, and the Prince who should first store
himself with numbers of such fire ships, would, through the help and
countenance of such frigates, be able to ruin the greatest force of such
vast ships as could be sent to sea, by the dexterity of working those
light, swift ships to guard the fire ships.He concluded there would
shortly be no other method of seafight; and that great ships and
men-of-war, however stored with guns and men, must submit to those who
should encounter them with far less number.He represented to us the
dreadful effect of these fire ships; that he continually observed in our
late maritime war with the Dutch that, when an enemy's fire ship
approached, the most valiant commander and common sailors were in such
consternation, that though then, of all times, there was most need of
the guns, bombs, etc., to keep the mischief off, they grew pale and
astonished, as if of a quite other mean soul, that they slunk about,
forsook their guns and work as if in despair, every one looking about to
see which way they might get out of their ship, though sure to be
drowned if they did so.This he said was likely to prove hereafter the
method of seafight, likely to be the misfortune of England if they
continued to put gentlemen-commanders over experienced seamen, on
account of their ignorance, effeminacy, and insolence.[Sidenote: LONDON]

9th March, 1690.Burnet, late Bishop of Sarum,
on Heb.13, anatomically describing the texture of the eye; and
that, as it received such innumerable sorts of spies through so very
small a passage to the brain, and that without the least confusion or
trouble, and accordingly judged and reflected on them; so God who made
this sensory, did with the greatest ease and at once see all that was
done through the vast universe, even to the very thought as well as
action.This similitude he continued with much perspicuity and aptness;
and applied it accordingly, for the admonishing us how uprightly we
ought to live and behave ourselves before such an all-seeing Deity; and
how we were to conceive of other his attributes, which we could have no
idea of than by comparing them by what we were able to conceive of the
nature and power of things, which were the objects of our senses; and
therefore it was that in Scripture we attribute those actions and
affections of God by the same of man, not as adequately or in any
proportion like them, but as the only expedient to make some resemblance
of his divine perfections; as when the Scripture says, "God will
remember the sins of the penitent no more:" not as if God could forget
anything, but as intimating he would pass by such penitents and receive
them to mercy.Asaph's, Almoner to the new Queen, with
the famous lawyer Sir George Mackenzie (late Lord Advocate of Scotland),
against whom both the Bishop and myself had written and published books,
but now most friendly reconciled.[73] He related to us many particulars
of Scotland, the present sad condition of it, the inveterate hatred
which the Presbyterians show to the family of the Stuarts, and the
exceeding tyranny of those bigots who acknowledge no superior on earth,
in civil or divine matters, maintaining that the people only have the
right of government; their implacable hatred to the Episcopal Order and
Church of England.He observed that the first Presbyterian dissents from
our discipline were introduced by the Jesuits' order, about the 20 of
Queen Elizabeth, a famous Jesuit among them feigning himself a
Protestant, and who was the first who began to pray extempore, and
brought in that which they since called, and are still so fond of,
praying by the Spirit.This Jesuit remained many years before he was
discovered, afterward died in Scotland, where he was buried at...
having yet on his monument, "_Rosa inter spinas_."[Footnote 73: Sir George, as we have seen, had written in praise of
    a Private Life, which Mr.Evelyn answered by a book in praise of
    Public Life and Active Employment.]Charlton's curiosities, both
of art and nature, and his full and rare collection of medals, which
taken altogether, in all kinds, is doubtless one of the most perfect
assemblages of rarities that can be any where seen.I much admired the
contortions of the Thea root, which was so perplexed, large, and
intricate, and withal hard as box, that it was wonderful to consider.King William set forth on his Irish expedition, leaving
the Queen Regent.Pepys read to me his Remonstrance, showing with
what malice and injustice he was suspected with Sir Anthony Deane about
the timber, of which the thirty ships were built by a late Act of
Parliament, with the exceeding danger which the fleet would shortly be
in, by reason of the tyranny and incompetency of those who now managed
the Admiralty and affairs of the Navy, of which he gave an accurate
state, and showed his great ability.Asaph; his
conversation was on the Vaudois in Savoy, who had been thought so near
destruction and final extirpation by the French, being totally given up
to slaughter, so that there were no hopes for them; but now it pleased
God that the Duke of Savoy, who had hitherto joined with the French in
their persecution, being now pressed by them to deliver up Saluzzo and
Turin as cautionary towns, on suspicion that he might at last come into
the Confederacy of the German Princes, did secretly concert measures
with, and afterward declared for, them.He then invited these poor
people from their dispersion among the mountains whither they had fled,
and restored them to their country, their dwellings, and the exercise of
their religion, and begged pardon for the ill usage they had received,
charging it on the cruelty of the French who forced him to it.These
being the remainder of those persecuted Christians which the Bishop of
St.Asaph had so long affirmed to be the two witnesses spoken of in the
Revelation, who should be killed and brought to life again, it was
looked on as an extraordinary thing that this prophesying Bishop should
persuade two fugitive ministers of the Vaudois to return to their
country, and furnish them with L20 toward their journey, at that very
time when nothing but universal destruction was to be expected, assuring
them and showing them from the Apocalypse, that their countrymen should
be returned safely to their country before they arrived.This happening
contrary to all expectation and appearance, did exceedingly credit the
Bishop's confidence how that prophecy of the witnesses should come to
pass, just at the time, and the very month, he had spoken of some years
before.Boyle and Lady Ranelagh his sister, to
whom he explained the necessity of it so fully, and so learnedly made
out, with what events were immediately to follow, viz, the French King's
ruin, the calling of the Jews to be near at hand, but that the Kingdom
of Antichrist would not yet be utterly destroyed till thirty years, when
Christ should begin the Millenium, not as personally and visibly
reigning on earth, but that the true religion and universal peace should
obtain through all the world.Mede, and
other interpreters of these events failed, by mistaking and reckoning
the year as the Latins and others did, to consist of the present
calculation, so many days to the year, whereas the Apocalypse reckons
after the Persian account, as Daniel did, whose visions St.John all
along explains as meaning only the Christian Church.Pepys, who the next day was sent to the
Gatehouse,[74] and several great persons to the Tower, on suspicion of
being affected to King James; among them was the Earl of Clarendon, the
Queen's uncle.King William having vanquished King James in Ireland,
there was much public rejoicing.It seems the Irish in King James's army
would not stand, but the English-Irish and French made great resistance.Walker, who so bravely defended
Londonderry.King William received a slight wound by the grazing of a
cannon bullet on his shoulder, which he endured with very little
interruption of his pursuit.Hamilton, who broke his word about
Tyrconnel, was taken.It is reported that King James is gone back to
France.Drogheda and Dublin surrendered, and if King William be
returning, we may say of him as Caesar said, "_Veni, vidi, vici_."But to
alloy much of this, the French fleet rides in our channel, ours not
daring to interpose, and the enemy threatening to land.[Footnote 74: Poor Pepys, as the reader knows, had already undergone
    an imprisonment, with perhaps just as much reason as the present, on
    the absurd accusation of having sent information to the French Court
    of the state of the English Navy.][Sidenote: LONDON]

27th June, 1690.I went to visit some friends in the Tower, when asking
for Lord Clarendon, they by mistake directed me to the Earl of
Torrington, who about three days before had been sent for from the
fleet, and put into the Tower for cowardice and not fighting the French
fleet, which having beaten a squadron of the Hollanders, while
Torrington did nothing, did now ride masters of the sea, threatening a
descent.This afternoon a camp of about 4,000 men was begun to
be formed on Blackheath.Pepys, now suffered to return to his
house, on account of indisposition.The Duke of Grafton came to visit me, going to his
ship at the mouth of the river, in his way to Ireland (where he was
slain).The French landed some soldiers at Teignmouth, in
Devon, and burned some poor houses.The French fleet still hovering
about the western coast, and we having 300 sail of rich merchant-ships
in the bay of Plymouth, our fleet began to move toward them, under three
admirals.The country in the west all on their guard.A very
extraordinary fine season; but on the 12th was a very great storm of
thunder and lightning, and on the 15th the season much changed to wet
and cold.The militia and trained bands, horse and foot, which were up
through England, were dismissed.The French King having news that King
William was slain, and his army defeated in Ireland, caused such a
triumph at Paris, and all over France, as was never heard of; when, in
the midst of it, the unhappy King James being vanquished, by a speedy
flight and escape, himself brought the news of his own defeat.I was desired to be one of the bail of the Earl of
Clarendon, for his release from the Tower, with divers noblemen.Asaph expounds his prophecies to me and Mr.The troops from Blackheath march to Portsmouth.That sweet and hopeful
youth, Sir Charles Tuke, died of the wounds he received in the fight of
the Boyne, to the great sorrow of all his friends, being (I think) the
last male of that family, to which my wife is related.A more virtuous
young gentleman I never knew; he was learned for his age, having had the
advantage of the choicest breeding abroad, both as to arts and arms; he
had traveled much, but was so unhappy as to fall in the side of his
unfortunate King.The unseasonable and most tempestuous weather happening, the naval
expedition is hindered, and the extremity of wet causes the siege of
Limerick to be raised, King William returned to England.Lord Sidney
left Governor of what is conquered in Ireland, which is near three parts
[in four].An extraordinary sharp, cold, east
wind.The French General, with Tyrconnel and their
forces, gone back to France, beaten out by King William.The Duke of Grafton was there mortally wounded and dies.The 8th of this month Lord Spencer wrote me
word from Althorpe, that there happened an earthquake the day before in
the morning, which, though short, sensibly shook the house.The
"Gazette" acquainted us that the like happened at the same time,
half-past seven, at Barnstaple, Holyhead, and Dublin.We were not
sensible of it here.Kinsale at last surrendered, meantime King James's
party burn all the houses they have in their power, and among them that
stately palace of Lord Ossory's, which lately cost, as reported,
L40,000.By a disastrous accident, a third-rate ship, the Breda, blew up
and destroyed all on board; in it were twenty-five prisoners of war.She
was to have sailed for England the next day.Went to the Countess of Clancarty, to condole with
her concerning her debauched and dissolute son, who had done so much
mischief in Ireland, now taken and brought prisoner to the Tower.Exceeding great storms, yet a warm season.Pepys's memorials to Lord Godolphin, now
resuming the commission of the Treasury, to the wonder of all his
friends.Having been chosen President of the Royal Society, I
desired to decline it, and with great difficulty devolved the election
on Sir Robert Southwell, Secretary of State to King William in Ireland.Hough, President of Magdalen College, Oxford,
who was displaced with several of the Fellows for not taking the oath
imposed by King James, now made a Bishop.Most of this month cold and
frost.One Johnson, a Knight, was executed at Tyburn for being an
accomplice with Campbell, brother to Lord Argyle, in stealing a young
heiress.This week a PLOT was discovered for a general
rising against the new Government, for which (Henry) Lord Clarendon and
others were sent to the Tower.The next day, I went to see Lord
Clarendon.Trial of Lord Preston, as not
being an English Peer, hastened at the Old Bailey.[Sidenote: LONDON]

18th January, 1691.Lord Preston condemned about a design to bring in
King James by the French.I went to visit Monsieur Justell and the Library at
St.James's, in which that learned man had put the MSS.(which were in
good number) into excellent order, they having lain neglected for many
years.Divers medals had been stolen and embezzled.Dined at Sir William Fermor's, who showed me many good
pictures.After dinner, a French servant played rarely on the lute.Sir
William had now bought all the remaining statues collected with so much
expense by the famous Thomas, Earl of Arundel, and sent them to his seat
at Easton, near Towcester.[75]

    [Footnote 75: They are now at Oxford, having been presented to the
    University in 1755 by Henrietta, Countess Dowager of Pomfret, widow
    of Thomas, the first Earl.]Lord Sidney, principal Secretary of State, gave me a
letter to Lord Lucas, Lieutenant of the Tower, to permit me to visit
Lord Clarendon; which this day I did, and dined with him.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th April, 1691.This night, a sudden and terrible fire burned down all
the buildings over the stone gallery at Whitehall to the water side,
beginning at the apartment of the late Duchess of Portsmouth (which had
been pulled down and rebuilt no less than three times to please her),
and consuming other lodgings of such lewd creatures, who debauched both
King Charles II.The King returned out of Holland just as this accident
happened--Proclamation against the <DW7>s, etc.Sloane's curiosities, being an
universal collection of the natural productions of Jamaica, consisting
of plants, fruits, corals, minerals, stones, earth, shells, animals, and
insects, collected with great judgment; several folios of dried plants,
and one which had about 80 several sorts of ferns, and another of
grasses; the Jamaica pepper, in branch, leaves, flower, fruit, etc.This
collection,[76] with his Journal and other philosophical and natural
discourses and observations, indeed very copious and extraordinary,
sufficient to furnish a history of that island, to which I encouraged
him.[Footnote 76: It now forms part of the collection in the British
    Museum.]The Archbishop of Canterbury, and Bishops of Ely, Bath
and Wells, Peterborough, Gloucester, and the rest who would not take the
oaths to King William, were now displaced; and in their rooms, Dr.Paul's, was made Archbishop: Patrick removed from
Chichester to Ely; Cumberland to Gloucester.I dined with Lord Clarendon in the Tower.I visited the Earl and Countess of Sunderland, now
come to kiss the King's hand after his return from Holland.I went to visit the Archbishop of Canterbury [Sancroft]
yet at Lambeth.I found him alone, and discoursing of the times,
especially of the newly designed Bishops; he told me that by no canon or
divine law they could justify the removing of the present incumbents;
that Dr.Beveridge, designed Bishop of Bath and Wells, came to ask his
advice; that the Archbishop told him, though he should give it, he
believed he would not take it; the Doctor said he would; why then, says
the Archbishop, when they come to ask, say "_Nolo_," and say it from the
heart; there is nothing easier than to resolve yourself what is to be
done in the case: the Doctor seemed to deliberate.What he will do I
know not, but Bishop Ken, who is to be put out, is exceedingly beloved
in his diocese; and, if he and the rest should insist on it, and plead
their interest as freeholders, it is believed there would be difficulty
in their case, and it may endanger a schism and much disturbance, so as
wise men think it had been better to have let them alone, than to have
proceeded with this rigor to turn them out for refusing to swear against
their consciences.I asked at parting, when his Grace removed; he said
that he had not yet received any summons, but I found the house
altogether disfurnished and his books packed up.I went with my son, and brother-in-law, Glanville, and
his son, to Wotton, to solemnize the funeral of my nephew, which was
performed the next day very decently and orderly by the herald in the
afternoon, a very great appearance of the country being there.I was the
chief mourner; the pall was held by Sir Francis Vincent, Sir Richard
Onslow, Mr.Thomas Howard (son to Sir Robert, and Captain of the King's
Guard), Mr.Herbert, nephew to Lord Herbert of
Cherbury, and cousin-german to my deceased nephew.He was laid in the
vault at Wotton Church, in the burying place of the family.A great
concourse of coaches and people accompanied the solemnity.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th June, 1691.I went to visit Lord Clarendon, still prisoner in the
Tower, though Lord Preston being pardoned was released.Cumberland, the
new Bishop of Norwich,[77] Dr.Lloyd having been put out for not
acknowledging the Government.Cumberland is a very learned, excellent
man.Tillotson, at Lambeth, by the
Sheriff; Archbishop Sancroft was gone, but had left his nephew to keep
possession; and he refusing to deliver it up on the Queen's message, was
dispossessed by the Sheriff, and imprisoned.This stout demeanor of the
few Bishops who refused to take the oaths to King William, animated a
great party to forsake the churches, so as to threaten a schism; though
those who looked further into the ancient practice, found that when (as
formerly) there were Bishops displaced on secular accounts, the people
never refused to acknowledge the new Bishops, provided they were not
heretics.The truth is, the whole clergy had till now stretched the duty
of passive obedience, so that the proceedings against these Bishops gave
no little occasion of exceptions; but this not amounting to heresy,
there was a necessity of receiving the new Bishops, to prevent a failure
of that order in the Church.I went to visit Lord Clarendon in the
Tower, but he was gone into the country for air by the Queen's
permission, under the care of his warden.Cumberland was made Bishop of
    Peterborough and Dr.Lloyd in the see of
    Norwich.]Stringfellow preach his first
sermon in the newly erected Church of Trinity, in Conduit Street; to
which I did recommend him to Dr.Tenison for the constant preacher and
lecturer.This Church, formerly built of timber on Hounslow-Heath by
King James for the mass priests, being begged by Dr.Martin's, was set up by that public-minded, charitable, and pious
man near my son's dwelling in Dover Street, chiefly at the charge of the
Doctor.I know him to be an excellent preacher and a fit person.Martin's, which is the Doctor's parish, he
was not only content, but was the sole industrious mover, that it should
be made a separate parish, in regard of the neighborhood having become
so populous.Wherefore to countenance and introduce the new minister,
and take possession of a gallery designed for my son's family, I went to
London, where,

19th July, 1691.Tenison preached the first sermon,
taking his text from Psalm xxvi."Lord, I have loved the habitation
of thy house, and the place where thine honor dwelleth."In concluding,
he gave that this should be made a parish church so soon as the
Parliament sat, and was to be dedicated to the Holy Trinity, in honor of
the three undivided persons in the Deity; and he minded them to attend
to that faith of the church, now especially that Arianism, Socinianism,
and atheism began to spread among us.Stringfellow
preached on Luke vii."The centurion who had built a synagogue."He
proceeded to the due praise of persons of such public spirit, and thence
to such a character of pious benefactors in the person of the generous
centurion, as was comprehensive of all the virtues of an accomplished
Christian, in a style so full, eloquent, and moving, that I never heard
a sermon more apposite to the occasion.He modestly insinuated the
obligation they had to that person who should be the author and promoter
of such public works for the benefit of mankind, especially to the
advantage of religion, such as building and endowing churches,
hospitals, libraries, schools, procuring the best editions of useful
books, by which he handsomely intimated who it was that had been so
exemplary for his benefaction to that place.Tenison, had also erected and furnished a public library [in
St.Martin's]; and set up two or three free schools at his own charges.Besides this, he was of an exemplary, holy life, took great pains in
constantly preaching, and incessantly employing himself to promote the
service of God both in public and private.I never knew a man of a more
universal and generous spirit, with so much modesty, prudence, and
piety.The great victory of King William's army in Ireland was looked on as
decisive of that war.Ruth, who had been so
cruel to the poor Protestants in France, was slain, with divers of the
best commanders; nor was it cheap to us, having 1,000 killed, but of the
enemy 4,000 or 5,000.An extraordinary hot season, yet refreshed by some
thundershowers.No sermon in the church in the afternoon, and the
curacy ill-served.A sermon by the curate; an honest discourse, but read
without any spirit, or seeming concern; a great fault in the education
of young preachers.Great thunder and lightning on Thursday, but the
rain and wind very violent.Our fleet come in to lay up the great ships;
nothing done at sea, pretending that we cannot meet the French.A great storm at sea; we lost the "Coronation" and
"Harwich," above 600 men perishing.Our navy come in without
having performed anything, yet there has been great loss of ships by
negligence, and unskillful men governing the fleet and Navy board.I visited the Earl of Dover, who having made his
peace with the King, was now come home.The relation he gave of the
strength of the French King, and the difficulty of our forcing him to
fight, and any way making impression into France, was very wide from
what we fancied.8th to 30th November, 1691.An extraordinary dry and warm season,
without frost, and like a new spring; such as had not been known for
many years.Part of the King's house at Kensington was burned.Discourse of another PLOT, in which several great
persons were named, but believed to be a sham.--A proposal in the House
of Commons that every officer in the whole nation who received a salary
above L500 or otherwise by virtue of his office, should contribute it
wholly to the support of the war with France, and this upon their oath.My daughter-in-law was brought to bed of a
daughter.An exceedingly dry and calm winter; no rain for
many past months.Dined at Lambeth with the new Archbishop.Saw the
effect of my greenhouse furnace, set up by the Archbishop's son-in-law.Charlton's collection of spiders,
birds, scorpions, and other serpents, etc.This last week died that pious, admirable
Christian, excellent philosopher, and my worthy friend, Mr.Boyle, aged
about 65,--a great loss to all that knew him, and to the public.[Sidenote: LONDON]

6th January, 1692.Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, preached on Eccles.He concluded
with an eulogy due to the deceased, who made God and religion the scope
of all his excellent talents in the knowledge of nature, and who had
arrived to so high a degree in it, accompanied with such zeal and
extraordinary piety, which he showed in the whole course of his life,
particularly in his exemplary charity on all occasions,--that he gave
L1,000 yearly to the distressed refugees of France and Ireland; was at
the charge of translating the Scriptures into the Irish and Indian
tongues, and was now promoting a Turkish translation, as he had formerly
done of Grotius "on the Truth of the Christian Religion" into Arabic,
which he caused to be dispersed in the eastern countries; that he had
settled a fund for preachers who should preach expressly against
Atheists, Libertines, Socinians, and Jews; that he had in his will given
L8,000 to charitable uses; but that his private charities were
extraordinary.He dilated on his learning in Hebrew and Greek, his
reading of the fathers, and solid knowledge in theology, once
deliberating about taking Holy Orders, and that at the time of
restoration of King Charles II., when he might have made a great figure
in the nation as to secular honor and titles, his fear of not being able
to discharge so weighty a duty as the first, made him decline that, and
his humility the other.He spoke of his civility to strangers, the great
good which he did by his experience in medicine and chemistry, and to
what noble ends he applied himself to his darling studies; the works,
both pious and useful, which he published; the exact life he led, and
the happy end he made.Something was touched of his sister, the Lady
Ranelagh, who died but a few days before him.And truly all this was but
his due, without any grain of flattery.This week a most execrable murder was committed on Dr.Clench, father of
that extraordinary learned child whom I have before noticed.Under
pretense of carrying him in a coach to see a patient, they strangled him
in it; and, sending away the coachman under some pretense, they left his
dead body in the coach, and escaped in the dusk of the evening.Tenison, now
Bishop of Lincoln, in Trinity Church, being the first that was
christened there.A frosty and dry season continued; many persons die
of apoplexy, more than usual.Lord Marlborough, Lieutenant-General of
the King's army in England, gentleman of the bedchamber, etc., dismissed
from all his charges, military and other, for his excessive taking of
bribes, covetousness, and extortion on all occasions from his inferior
officers.Note, this was the Lord who was entirely advanced by King
James, and was the first who betrayed and forsook his master.He was son
of Sir Winston Churchill of the Greencloth.Boyle having made me one of the trustees for
his charitable bequests, I went to a meeting of the Bishop of Lincoln,
Sir Rob.... wood, and serjeant, Rotheram, to settle that clause in the
will which related to charitable uses, and especially the appointing and
electing a minister to preach one sermon the first Sunday in the month,
during the four summer months, expressly against Atheists, Deists,
Libertines, Jews, etc., without descending to any other controversy
whatever, for which L50 per annum is to be paid quarterly to the
preacher; and, at the end of three years, to proceed to a new election
of some other able divine, or to continue the same, as the trustees
should judge convenient.Bentley, chaplain to
the Bishop of Worcester (Dr.The first sermon was
appointed for the first Sunday in March, at St.Martin's; the second
Sunday in April, at Bow Church, and so alternately.Lord Marlborough having used words against the
King, and been discharged from all his great places, his wife was
forbidden the Court, and the Princess of Denmark was desired by the
Queen to dismiss her from her service; but she refusing to do so, goes
away from Court to Sion house.Divers new Lords made: Sir Henry Capel,
Sir William Fermor, etc.The
Parliament adjourned, not well satisfied with affairs.The business of
the East India Company, which they would have reformed, let fall.The
Duke of Norfolk does not succeed in his endeavor to be divorced.[78]

    [Footnote 78: See _post_ pp.My son was made one of the Commissioners of the
Revenue and Treasury of Ireland, to which employment he had a mind, far
from my wishes.I visited the Earl of Peterborough, who showed me the
picture of the Prince of Wales, newly brought out of France, seeming in
my opinion very much to resemble the Queen his mother, and of a most
vivacious countenance.The Queen Dowager went out of
England toward Portugal, as pretended, against the advice of all her
friends.So excellent a discourse against the Epicurean system is
not to be recapitulated in a few words.He came to me to ask whether I
thought it should be printed, or that there was anything in it which I
desired to be altered.I took this as a civility, and earnestly desired
it should be printed, as one of the most learned and convincing
discourses I had ever heard.King James sends a letter written and directed
by his own hand to several of the Privy Council, and one to his
daughter, the Queen Regent, informing them of the Queen being ready to
be brought to bed, and summoning them to be at the birth by the middle
of May, promising as from the French King, permission to come and return
in safety.Much apprehension of a French invasion, and of an
universal rising.Unkindness
between the Queen and her sister.Very cold and unseasonable weather,
scarce a leaf on the trees.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th May, 1692.Reports of an invasion were very hot, and alarmed the
city, Court, and people; nothing but securing suspected persons, sending
forces to the seaside, and hastening out the fleet.Continued discourse
of the French invasion, and of ours in France.The eastern wind so
constantly blowing, gave our fleet time to unite, which had been so
tardy in preparation, that, had not God thus wonderfully favored, the
enemy would in all probability have fallen upon us.Many daily secured,
and proclamations out for more conspirators.My kinsman, Sir Edward Evelyn, of Long Ditton, died
suddenly.I dined at my cousin Cheny's, son to my Lord Cheny, who
married my cousin Pierpoint.My niece, M. Evelyn, was now married to Sir Cyril Wyche,
Secretary of State for Ireland.After all our apprehensions of being
invaded, and doubts of our success by sea, it pleased God to give us a
great naval victory, to the utter ruin of the French fleet, their
admiral and all their best men-of-war, transport-ships, etc.Though this day was set apart expressly for celebrating
the memorable birth, return, and restoration of the late King Charles
II., there was no notice taken of it, nor any part of the office annexed
to the Common Prayer Book made use of, which I think was ill done, in
regard his restoration not only redeemed us from anarchy and confusion,
but restored the Church of England as it were miraculously.I went to Windsor to carry my grandson to Eton School,
where I met my Lady Stonehouse and other of my daughter-in-law's
relations, who came on purpose to see her before her journey into
Ireland.We went to see the castle, which we found furnished and very
neatly kept, as formerly, only that the arms in the guard chamber and
keep were removed and carried away.An exceeding great storm of wind and
rain, in some places stripping the trees of their fruit and leaves as if
it had been winter; and an extraordinary wet season, with great floods.I went with my wife, son, and daughter, to Eton, to see
my grandson, and thence to my Lord Godolphin's, at Cranburn, where we
lay, and were most honorably entertained.George's
Chapel, and returned to London late in the evening.Hewer's at Clapham, where he has an excellent,
useful, and capacious house on the Common, built by Sir Den.Gauden, and
by him sold to Mr.Hewer, who got a very considerable estate in the
Navy, in which, from being Mr.Pepys's clerk, he came to be one of the
principal officers, but was put out of all employment on the Revolution,
as were all the best officers, on suspicion of being no friends to the
change; such were put in their places, as were most shamefully ignorant
and unfit.Hewer lives very handsomely and friendly to everybody.Our fleet was now sailing on their long pretense of a descent on the
French coast; but, after having sailed one hundred leagues, returned,
the admiral and officers disagreeing as to the place where they were to
land, and the time of year being so far spent,--to the great dishonor of
those at the helm, who concerted their matters so indiscreetly, or, as
some thought, designedly.This whole summer was exceedingly wet and rainy, the like had not been
known since the year 1648; while in Ireland they had not known so great
a drought.I went to visit the Bishop of Lincoln, when, among
other things, he told me that one Dr.Chaplin, of University College in
Oxford, was the person who wrote the "Whole Duty of Man"; that he used
to read it to his pupil, and communicated it to Dr.Sterne, afterward
Archbishop of York, but would never suffer any of his pupils to have a
copy of it.Came the sad news of the hurricane and
earthquake, which has destroyed almost the whole Island of Jamaica, many
thousands having perished.My son, his wife, and little daughter, went for
Ireland, there to reside as one of the Commissioners of the Revenue.There happened an earthquake, which, though not so
great as to do any harm in England, was universal in all these parts of
Europe.It shook the house at Wotton, but was not perceived by any save
a servant or two, who were making my bed, and another in a garret.I and
the rest being at dinner below in the parlor, were not sensible of it.The dreadful one in Jamaica this summer was profanely and ludicrously
represented in a puppet play, or some such lewd pastime, in the fair of
Southwark, which caused the Queen to put down that idle and vicious mock
show.This season was so exceedingly cold, by reason of a
long and tempestuous northeast wind, that this usually pleasant month
was very uncomfortable.Harbord dies at
Belgrade; Lord Paget sent Ambassador in his room.There was a vestry called about repairing or new
building of the church [at Deptford], which I thought unseasonable in
regard of heavy taxes, and other improper circumstances, which I there
declared.A solemn Thanksgiving for our victory at sea, safe
return of the King, etc.Lancaster, the new Vicar of St.A signal robbery in Hertfordshire of the tax money bringing out of the
north toward London.They were set upon by several desperate persons,
who dismounted and stopped all travelers on the road, and guarding them
in a field, when the exploit was done, and the treasure taken, they
killed all the horses of those whom they stayed, to hinder pursuit,
being sixteen horses.They then dismissed those that they had
dismounted.With much reluctance we gratified Sir J.
Rotherham, one of Mr.Boyle's trustees, by admitting the Bishop of Bath
and Wells to be lecturer for the next year, instead of Mr.Bentley, who
had so worthily acquitted himself.We intended to take him in again the
next year.[Sidenote: LONDON]

January, 1692-93.Contest in Parliament about a self-denying Act, that
no Parliament man should have any office; it wanted only two or three
voices to have been carried.The Duke of Norfolk's bill for a divorce
thrown out, he having managed it very indiscreetly.The quarrel between
Admiral Russell and Lord Nottingham yet undetermined.After five days' trial and extraordinary contest,
the Lord Mohun was acquitted by the Lords of the murder of Montford, the
player, notwithstanding the judges, from the pregnant witnesses of the
fact, had declared him guilty; but whether in commiseration of his
youth, being not eighteen years old, though exceedingly dissolute, or
upon whatever other reason, the King himself present some part of the
trial, and satisfied, as they report, that he was culpable.69 acquitted
him, only 14 condemned him.Unheard of stories of the universal increase of witches in New England;
men, women, and children, devoting themselves to the devil, so as to
threaten the subversion of the government.[79] At the same time there
was a conspiracy among the <DW64>s in Barbadoes to murder all their
masters, discovered by overhearing a discourse of two of the slaves, and
so preventing the execution of the design.France in the utmost misery and poverty for want of corn and
subsistence, while the ambitious King is intent to pursue his conquests
on the rest of his neighbors both by sea and land.Our Admiral, Russell,
laid aside for not pursuing the advantage he had obtained over the
French in the past summer; three others chosen in his place.Burnet,
Bishop of Salisbury's book burned by the hangman for an expression of
the King's title by conquest, on a complaint of Joseph How, a member of
Parliament, little better than a madman.[Footnote 79: Some account of these poor people is given in Bray and
    Manning's "History of Surrey," ii.Miller, Vicar of Effingham, in that county, who was chaplain to
    the King's forces in the colony from 1692 to 1695.Some of the
    accused were convicted and executed; but Sir William Phipps, the
    Governor, had the good sense to reprieve, and afterward pardon,
    several; and the Queen approved his conduct.]The Bishop of Lincoln preached in the afternoon at
the Tabernacle near Golden Square, set up by him.Proposals of a
marriage between Mr.Hitherto an
exceedingly warm winter, such as has seldom been known, and portending
an unprosperous spring as to the fruits of the earth; our climate
requires more cold and winterly weather.The dreadful and astonishing
earthquake swallowing up Catania, and other famous and ancient cities,
with more than 100,000 persons in Sicily, on 11th January last, came now
to be reported among us.An extraordinary deep snow, after almost no winter,
and a sudden gentle thaw.A deplorable earthquake at Malta, since that
of Sicily, nearly as great.A new Secretary of State, Sir John Trenchard; the
Attorney-General, Somers, made Lord-Keeper, a young lawyer of
extraordinary merit.King William goes toward Flanders; but returns, the
wind being contrary.I met the King going to Gravesend to embark in his
yacht for Holland.My daughter Susanna was married to William Draper,
Esq., in the chapel of Ely House, by Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln
(since Archbishop).I gave her in portion L4,000, her jointure is L500
per annum.I pray Almighty God to give his blessing to this marriage!She is a good child, religious, discreet, ingenious, and qualified with
all the ornaments of her sex.She has a peculiar talent in design, as
painting in oil and miniature, and an extraordinary genius for whatever
hands can do with a needle.She has the French tongue, has read most of
the Greek and Roman authors and poets, using her talents with great
modesty; exquisitely shaped, and of an agreeable countenance.This
character is due to her, though coming from her father.Much of this
week spent in ceremonies, receiving visits and entertaining relations,
and a great part of the next in returning visits.We accompanied my daughter to her husband's house,
where with many of his and our relations we were magnificently treated.There we left her in an apartment very richly adorned and furnished, and
I hope in as happy a condition as could be wished, and with the great
satisfaction of all our friends; for which God be praised!Muttering of a design
to bring forces under color of an expected descent, to be a standing
army for other purposes.Talk of a declaration of the French King,
offering mighty advantages to the confederates, exclusive of King
William; and another of King James, with an universal pardon, and
referring the composing of all differences to a Parliament.These were
yet but discourses; but something is certainly under it.A declaration
or manifesto from King James, so written, that many thought it
reasonable, and much more to the purpose than any of his former.I went to my Lord Griffith's chapel; the common
church office was used for the King without naming the person, with some
other, apposite to the necessity and circumstances of the time.I dined at Sir William Godolphin's; and, after evening
prayer, visited the Duchess of Grafton.I saw a great auction of pictures in the Banqueting
house, Whitehall.They had been my Lord Melford's, now Ambassador from
King James at Rome, and engaged to his creditors here.Lord Mulgrave and
Sir Edward Seymour came to my house, and desired me to go with them to
the sale.Divers more of the great lords, etc., were there, and bought
pictures dear enough.There were some very excellent of Vandyke, Rubens,
and Bassan.Lord Godolphin bought the picture of the Boys, by Murillo
the Spaniard, for 80 guineas, dear enough; my nephew Glanville, the old
Earl of Arundel's head by Rubens, for L20.Growing late, I did not stay
till all were sold.A very wet hay harvest, and little summer as yet.Parr at Camberwell,
preached an excellent sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

13th July, 1693.I saw the Queen's rare cabinets and collection of
china; which was wonderfully rich and plentiful, but especially a large
cabinet, looking-glass frame and stands, all of amber, much of it white,
with historical bas-reliefs and statues, with medals carved in them,
esteemed worth L4,000, sent by the Duke of Brandenburgh, whose country,
Prussia, abounds with amber, cast up by the sea; divers other China and
Indian cabinets, screens, and hangings.In her library were many books
in English, French, and Dutch, of all sorts; a cupboard of gold plate; a
cabinet of silver filagree, which I think was our Queen Mary's, and
which, in my opinion, should have been generously sent to her.I dined with Lord Mulgrave, with the Earl of
Devonshire, Mr.Hampden (a scholar and fine gentleman), Dr.Davenant,
Sir Henry Vane, and others, and saw and admired the Venus of Correggio,
which Lord Mulgrave had newly bought of Mr.Daun for L250; one of the
best paintings I ever saw.Lord Capel, Sir Cyril Wyche, and Mr.Duncomb, made
Lord Justices in Ireland; Lord Sydney recalled, and made Master of the
Ordnance.Very lovely harvest weather, and a wholesome season,
but no garden fruit.Lord Nottingham resigned as Secretary of State; the
Commissioners of the Admiralty ousted, and Russell restored to his
office.The season continued very wet, as it had nearly all the summer,
if one might call it summer, in which there was no fruit, but corn was
very plentiful.In the lottery set up after the Venetian manner by
Mr.Neale, Sir R. Haddock, one of the Commissioners of the Navy, had the
greatest lot, L3,000; my coachman L40.Was the funeral of Captain Young, who died of the
stone and great age.I think he was the first who in the first war with
Cromwell against Spain, took the Governor of Havanna, and another rich
prize, and struck the first stroke against the Dutch fleet in the first
war with Holland in the time of the Rebellion; a sober man and an
excellent seaman.Much importuned to take the office of President of
the Royal Society, but I again declined it.We all dined at Pontac's as usual.Bentley preached at the Tabernacle, near Golden
Square.I gave my voice for him to proceed on his former subject the
following year in Mr.Boyle's lecture, in which he had been interrupted
by the importunity of Sir J. Rotheram that the Bishop of Chichester[80]
might be chosen the year before, to the great dissatisfaction of the
Bishop of Lincoln and myself.The Duchess of
Grafton's appeal to the House of Lords for the Prothonotary's place
given to the late Duke and to her son by King Charles II., now
challenged by the Lord Chief Justice.The judges were severely reproved
on something they said.[Footnote 80: A mistake for Bath and Wells.Bishop Kidder is
    referred to.]Prince Lewis of Baden came to London, and was much
feasted.Danish ships arrested carrying corn and naval stores to France.Dryden, the poet, who now intended to write no more plays, being intent
on his translation of Virgil.He read to us his prologue and epilogue to
his valedictory play now shortly to be acted.Lord Macclesfield, Lord Warrington, and Lord
Westmorland, all died within about one week.Several persons shot,
hanged, and made away with themselves.Now was the great trial of the appeal of Lord Bath
and Lord Montagu before the Lords, for the estate of the late Duke of
Albemarle.Stringfellow preached at Trinity parish, being
restored to that place, after the contest between the Queen and the
Bishop of London who had displaced him.Came the dismal news of the disaster befallen our
Turkey fleet by tempest, to the almost utter ruin of that trade, the
convoy of three or four men-of-war, and divers merchant ships, with all
their men and lading, having perished.[Sidenote: LONDON]

25th March, 1694.Martin's, preached; he was
likewise put in by the Queen, on the issue of her process with the
Bishop of London.I went to the Duke of Norfolk, to desire him to make
cousin Evelyn of Nutfield one of the Deputy-Lieutenants of Surrey, and
entreat him to dismiss my brother, now unable to serve by reason of age
and infirmity.The Duke granted the one, but would not suffer my brother
to resign his commission, desiring he should keep the honor of it during
his life, though he could not act.He professed great kindness to our
family.Sharp, Archbishop of York, preached in the
afternoon at the Tabernacle, by Soho.Bentley, our Boyle Lecturer, Chaplain to the
Bishop of Worcester, came to see me.A fiery exhalation rising out of the sea, spread itself
in Montgomeryshire a furlong broad, and many miles in length, burning
all straw, hay, thatch, and grass, but doing no harm to trees, timber,
or any solid things, only firing barns, or thatched houses.It left such
a taint on the grass as to kill all the cattle that eat of it.I saw the
attestations in the hands of the sufferers."The
Berkeley Castle" sunk by the French coming from the East Indies, worth
L200,000.The French took our castle of Gamboo in Guinea, so that the
Africa Actions fell to L30, and the India to L80.Some regiments of
Highland Dragoons were on their march through England; they were of
large stature, well appointed and disciplined.One of them having
reproached a Dutchman for cowardice in our late fight, was attacked by
two Dutchmen, when with his sword he struck off the head of one, and
cleft the skull of the other down to his chin.A very young gentleman named Wilson, the younger son of one who had not
above L200 a year estate, lived in the garb and equipage of the richest
nobleman, for house, furniture, coaches, saddle horses, and kept a
table, and all things accordingly, redeemed his father's estate, and
gave portions to his sisters, being challenged by one Laws, a Scotchman,
was killed in a duel, not fairly.The quarrel arose from his taking away
his own sister from lodging in a house where this Laws had a mistress,
which the mistress of the house thinking a disparagement to it, and
losing by it, instigated Laws to this duel.The mystery is how this so young a gentleman, very sober and
of good fame, could live in such an expensive manner; it could not be
discovered by all possible industry, or entreaty of his friends to make
him reveal it.It did not appear that he was kept by women, play,
coining, padding, or dealing in chemistry; but he would sometimes say
that if he should live ever so long, he had wherewith to maintain
himself in the same manner.He was very civil and well-natured, but of
no great force of understanding.Waller, an extraordinary young
gentleman of great accomplishments, skilled in mathematics, anatomy,
music, painting both in oil and miniature to great perfection, an
excellent botanist, a rare engraver on brass, writer in Latin, and a
poet; and with all this exceedingly modest.His house is an academy of
itself.I carried him to see Brompton Park [by Knightsbridge], where he
was in admiration at the store of rare plants, and the method he found
in that noble nursery, and how well it was cultivated.A public Bank of
L140,000, set up by Act of Parliament among other Acts, and Lotteries
for money to carry on the war.A
great rising of people in Buckinghamshire, on the declaration of a
famous preacher, till now reputed a sober and religious man, that our
Lord Christ appearing to him on the 16th of this month, told him he was
now come down, and would appear publicly at Pentecost, and gather all
the saints, Jews and Gentiles, and lead them to Jerusalem, and begin the
Millennium, and destroying and judging the wicked, deliver the
government of the world to the saints.Great multitudes followed this
preacher, divers of the most zealous brought their goods and
considerable sums of money, and began to live in imitation of the
primitive saints, minding no private concerns, continually dancing and
singing Hallelujah night and day.This brings to mind what I lately
happened to find in Alstedius, that the thousand years should begin this
very year 1694; it is in his "Encyclopaedia Biblica."My copy of the book
printed near sixty years ago.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

4th May, 1694.I went this day with my wife and four servants from Sayes
Court, removing much furniture of all sorts, books, pictures, hangings,
bedding, etc., to furnish the apartment my brother assigned me, and now,
after more than forty years, to spend the rest of my days with him at
Wotton, where I was born; leaving my house at Deptford full furnished,
and three servants, to my son-in-law Draper, to pass the summer in, and
such longer time as he should think fit to make use of it.This being the first Sunday in the month, the blessed
sacrament of the Lord's Supper ought to have been celebrated at Wotton
church, but in this parish it is exceedingly neglected, so that, unless
at the four great feasts, there is no communion hereabouts; which is a
great fault both in ministers and people.I have spoken to my brother,
who is the patron, to discourse the minister about it.Scarcely one
shower has fallen since the beginning of April.This week we had news of my Lord Tiviot having cut his
own throat, through what discontent not yet said.He had been, not many
years past, my colleague in the commission of the Privy Seal, in old
acquaintance, very soberly and religiously inclined.Lord, what are we
without thy continual grace!Lord Falkland, grandson to the learned Lord Falkland, Secretary of State
to King Charles I., and slain in his service, died now of the smallpox.He was a pretty, brisk, understanding, industrious young gentleman; had
formerly been faulty, but now much reclaimed; had also the good luck to
marry a very great fortune, besides being entitled to a vast sum, his
share of the Spanish wreck, taken up at the expense of divers
adventurers.From a Scotch Viscount he was made an English Baron,
designed Ambassador for Holland; had been Treasurer of the Navy, and
advancing extremely in the new Court.All now gone in a moment, and I
think the title is extinct.I know not whether the estate devolves to my
cousin Carew.It was at my Lord Falkland's, whose lady importuned us to
let our daughter be with her some time, so that that dear child took the
same infection, which cost her valuable life.Edwards, minister of Denton, in Sussex, a living in
my brother's gift, came to see him.Wotton, that extraordinary learned
young man, preached excellently.Duncomb, minister of Albury, preached at Wotton, a
very religious and exact discourse.The first great bank for a fund of money being now established by Act of
Parliament, was filled and completed to the sum of L120,000, and put
under the government of the most able and wealthy citizens of London.All who adventured any sum had four per cent., so long as it lay in the
bank, and had power either to take it out at pleasure, or transfer it.Glorious steady weather; corn and all fruits in extraordinary plenty
generally.Lord Berkeley burnt Dieppe and Havre de Grace with
bombs, in revenge for the defeat at Brest.This manner of destructive
war was begun by the French, is exceedingly ruinous, especially falling
on the poorer people, and does not seem to tend to make a more speedy
end of the war; but rather to exasperate and incite to revenge.Many
executed at London for clipping money, now done to that intolerable
extent, that there was hardly any money that was worth above half the
nominal value.I went to visit my cousin, George Evelyn of Nutfield,
where I found a family of ten children, five sons and five
daughters--all beautiful women grown, and extremely well-fashioned.All
painted in one piece, very well, by Mr.Lutterell, in crayon on copper,
and seeming to be as finely painted as the best miniature.They are the
children of two extraordinary beautiful wives.Stormy and unseasonable wet weather this week.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th October, 1694.Paul's to see the choir, now finished
as to the stone work, and the scaffold struck both without and within,
in that part.Some exceptions might perhaps be taken as to the placing
columns on pilasters at the east tribunal.As to the rest it is a piece
of architecture without reproach.The pulling out the forms, like
drawers, from under the stalls, is ingenious.I went also to see the
building beginning near St.Giles's, where seven streets make a star
from a Doric pillar placed in the middle of a circular area; said to be
built by Mr.Neale, introducer of the late lotteries, in imitation of
those at Venice, now set up here, for himself twice, and now one for the
State.Visited the Bishop of Lincoln [Tenison] newly come
on the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who a few days before had
a paralytic stroke,--the same day and month that Archbishop Sancroft was
put out.A very sickly time, especially the smallpox, of which divers
considerable persons died.The State lottery[81] drawing, Mr.Cock, a
French refugee, and a President in the Parliament of Paris for the
Reformed, drew a lot of L1,000 per annum.[Footnote 81: State lotteries finally closed October 18, 1826.]I visited the Marquis of Normanby, and had much
discourse concerning King Charles II.Also concerning
the _quinquina_ which the physicians would not give to the King, at a
time when, in a dangerous ague, it was the only thing that could cure
him (out of envy because it had been brought into vogue by Mr.Tudor, an
apothecary), till Dr.Short, to whom the King sent to know his opinion
of it privately, he being reputed a <DW7> (but who was in truth a very
honest, good Christian), sent word to the King that it was the only
thing which could save his life, and then the King enjoined his
physicians to give it to him, which they did and he recovered.Being
asked by this Lord why they would not prescribe it, Dr.Lower said it
would spoil their practice, or some such expression, and at last
confessed it was a remedy fit only for kings.Exception was taken that
the late Archbishop did not cause any of his Chaplains to use any office
for the sick during his illness.I had news that my dear and worthy friend, Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln, was made Archbishop of Canterbury, for which
I thank God and rejoice, he being most worthy of it, for his learning,
piety, and prudence.He being my
proxy, gave my vote for Dr.The smallpox increased exceedingly, and was very
mortal.The Queen died of it on the 28th.The deaths by
smallpox increased to five hundred more than in the preceding week.The
King and Princess Anne reconciled, and she was invited to keep her Court
at Whitehall, having hitherto lived privately at Berkeley House; she was
desired to take into her family divers servants of the late Queen; to
maintain them the King has assigned her L5,000 a quarter.The frost and continual snow have now lasted five
weeks.Lord Spencer married the Duke of Newcastle's daughter,
and our neighbor, Mr.Hussey, married a daughter of my cousin, George
Evelyn, of Nutfield.The long frost intermitted, but not gone.Called to London by Lord Godolphin, one of the
Lords of the Treasury, offering me the treasurership of the hospital
designed to be built at Greenwich for worn-out seamen.The Marquis of Normanby told me King Charles had a
design to buy all King Street, and build it nobly, it being the street
leading to Westminster.This might have been done for the expense of the
Queen's funeral, which was L50,000, against her desire.Never was so universal a
mourning; all the Parliament men had cloaks given them, and four hundred
poor women; all the streets hung and the middle of the street boarded
and covered with black cloth.There were all the nobility, mayor,
aldermen, judges, etc.I supped at the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry's,
who related to me the pious behavior of the Queen in all her sickness,
which was admirable.She never inquired of what opinion persons were,
who were objects of charity; that, on opening a cabinet, a paper was
found wherein she had desired that her body might not be opened, or any
extraordinary expense at her funeral, whenever she should die.This
paper was not found in time to be observed.There were other excellent
things under her own hand, to the very least of her debts, which were
very small, and everything in that exact method, as seldom is found in
any private person.In sum, she was such an admirable woman, abating for
taking the Crown without a more due apology, as does, if possible, outdo
the renowned Queen Elizabeth.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with Lord Spencer.My Lord showed me his library, now again improved by many books bought
at the sale of Sir Charles Scarborough, an eminent physician, which was
the very best collection, especially of mathematical books, that was I
believe in Europe, once designed for the King's Library at St.James's;
but the Queen dying, who was the great patroness of that design, it was
let fall, and the books were miserably dissipated.The new edition of Camden's "Britannia" was now published (by Bishop
Gibson), with great additions; those to Surrey were mine, so that I had
one presented to me.of some parts of the New
Testament in vulgar Latin, that had belonged to a monastery in the North
of Scotland, which he esteemed to be about eight hundred years old;
there were some considerable various readings observable, as in John i.,
and genealogy of St.Duncomb, parson of this parish,
preached, which he hardly comes to above once a year though but seven or
eight miles off; a florid discourse, read out of his notes.The Holy
Sacrament followed, which he administered with very little reverence,
leaving out many prayers and exhortations; nor was there any oblation.This ought to be reformed, but my good brother did not well consider
when he gave away this living and the next [Abinger].The latter end of the month sharp and severely cold, with
much snow and hard frost; no appearance of spring.Lucas preached in the afternoon at Wotton.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th April, 1695.Lord Halifax died suddenly at London, the day his
daughter was married to the Earl of Nottingham's son at Burleigh.Lord
H. was a very rich man, very witty, and in his younger days somewhat
positive.After a most severe, cold, and snowy winter, without
almost any shower for many months, the wind continuing N. and E. and not
a leaf appearing; the weather and wind now changed, some showers fell,
and there was a remission of cold.The spring begins to appear, yet the trees hardly
leafed.Sir T. Cooke discovers what prodigious bribes have been given by
some of the East India Company out of the stock, which makes a great
clamor.Never were so many private bills passed for unsettling estates,
showing the wonderful prodigality and decay of families.I came to Deptford from Wotton, in order to the first
meeting of the Commissioners for endowing an hospital for seamen at
Greenwich; it was at the Guildhall, London.Present, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Lord Keeper, Lord Privy Seal, Lord Godolphin, Duke of
Shrewsbury, Duke of Leeds, Earls of Dorset and Monmouth, Commissioners
of the Admiralty and Navy, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Christopher Wren, and
several more.Lowndes, Secretary to the
Lords of the Treasury, Surveyor-General.Second meeting of the Commissioners, and a committee
appointed to go to Greenwich to survey the place, I being one of them.We went to survey Greenwich, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir
Christopher Wren, Mr.Travers, the King's Surveyor, Captain Sanders, and
myself.We made report of the state of Greenwich house, and how
the standing part might be made serviceable at present for L6,000, and
what ground would be requisite for the whole design.My Lord Keeper
ordered me to prepare a book for subscriptions, and a preamble to it.Vanbrugh was made secretary to the
commission, by my nomination of him to the Lords, which was all done
that day.The commissioners met at Guildhall, when there were
scruples and contests of the Lord Mayor, who would not meet, not being
named as one of the quorum, so that a new commission was required,
though the Lord Keeper and the rest thought it too nice a punctilio.Met at Guildhall, but could do nothing for want of a
quorum.At Guildhall; account of subscriptions, about L7,000 or
L8,000.I dined at Lambeth, making my first visit to the
Archbishop, where there was much company, and great cheer.After prayers
in the evening, my Lord made me stay to show me his house, furniture,
and garden, which were all very fine, and far beyond the usual
Archbishops, not as affected by this, but being bought ready furnished
by his predecessor.We discoursed of several public matters,
particularly of the Princess of Denmark, who made so little figure.Met at Guildhall; not a full committee, so nothing
done.No sermon at church; but, after prayers, the names of
all the parishioners were read, in order to gathering the tax of 4s.for
marriages, burials, etc.A very imprudent tax, especially this reading
the names, so that most went out of the church.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

19th July, 1695.I dined at Sir Purbeck Temple's, near Croydon; his lady
is aunt to my son-in-law, Draper; the house exactly furnished.Went
thence with my son and daughter to Wotton.Duncomb,
parson of Albury, preached excellently.The weather now so cold, that greater frosts were not
always seen in the midst of winter; this succeeded much wet, and set
harvest extremely back.Offley preached at Abinger; too much
controversy on a point of no consequence, for the country people here.This was the first time I had heard him preach.Bombarding of Cadiz; a
cruel and brutish way of making war, first began by the French.The
season wet, great storms, unseasonable harvest weather.My good and
worthy friend, Captain Gifford, who that he might get some competence to
live decently, adventured all he had in a voyage of two years to the
East Indies, was, with another great ship, taken by some French
men-of-war, almost within sight of England, to the loss of near L70,000,
to my great sorrow, and pity of his wife, he being also a valiant and
industrious man.The losses of this sort to the nation have been
immense, and all through negligence, and little care to secure the same
near our own coasts; of infinitely more concern to the public than
spending their time in bombarding and ruining two or three paltry towns,
without any benefit, or weakening our enemies, who, though they began,
ought not to be imitated in an action totally averse to humanity, or
Christianity.Sir Purbeck Temple, uncle to my
son Draper, died suddenly.His lady being
own aunt to my son Draper, he hopes for a good fortune, there being no
heir.There had been a new meeting of the commissioners about Greenwich
hospital, on the new commission, where the Lord Mayor, etc.appeared,
but I was prevented by indisposition from attending.The weather very
sharp, winter approaching apace.The King went a progress into the
north, to show himself to the people against the elections, and was
everywhere complimented, except at Oxford, where it was not as he
expected, so that he hardly stopped an hour there, and having seen the
theater, did not receive the banquet proposed.Paul's school, who showed me many curious passages out of some
ancient Platonists' MSS.concerning the Trinity, which this great and
learned person would publish, with many other rare things, if he was
encouraged, and eased of the burden of teaching.The Archbishop and myself went to Hammersmith, to
visit Sir Samuel Morland, who was entirely blind; a very mortifying
sight.He showed us his invention of writing, which was very ingenious;
also his wooden calendar, which instructed him all by feeling; and other
pretty and useful inventions of mills, pumps, etc., and the pump he had
erected that serves water to his garden, and to passengers, with an
inscription, and brings from a filthy part of the Thames near it a most
perfect and pure water.He had newly buried L200 worth of music books
six feet under ground, being, as he said, love songs and vanity.He
plays himself psalms and religious hymns on the theorbo.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th November, 1695.Stanhope, Vicar of Lewisham, preached at
Whitehall.He is one of the most accomplished preachers I ever heard,
for matter, eloquence, action, voice, and I am told, of excellent
conversation.Famous fireworks and very chargeable, the King
being returned from his progress.He stayed seven or eight days at Lord
Sunderland's at Althorpe, where he was mightily entertained.These
fireworks were shown before Lord Romney, master of the ordnance, in St.James's great square, where the King stood.I spoke to the Archbishop of Canterbury to interest
himself for restoring a room belonging to St.James's library, where the
books want place.Williams continued in Boyle's
lectures another year.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, now the great favorite
and underhand politician, but not adventuring on any character, being
obnoxious to the people for having twice changed his religion.The Parliament wondrously intent on ways to reform
the coin; setting out a Proclamation prohibiting the currency of
half-crowns, etc., which made much confusion among the people.Hitherto mild, dark, misty, weather.Great confusion and distraction by reason of the
clipped money, and the difficulty found in reforming it.An extraordinary wet season, though temperate as to
cold.The "Royal Sovereign" man-of-war burned at Chatham.It was built
in 1637, and having given occasion to the levy of ship money was perhaps
the cause of all the after troubles to this day.An earthquake in
Dorsetshire by Portland, or rather a sinking of the ground suddenly for
a large space, near the quarries of stone, hindering the conveyance of
that material for the finishing St.There was now a conspiracy of about thirty
knights, gentlemen, captains, many of them Irish and English <DW7>s,
and Nonjurors or Jacobites (so called), to murder King William on the
first opportunity of his going either from Kensington, or to hunting, or
to the chapel; and upon signal of fire to be given from Dover Cliff to
Calais, an invasion was designed.In order to it there was a great army
in readiness, men-of-war and transports, to join a general insurrection
here, the Duke of Berwick having secretly come to London to head them,
King James attending at Calais with the French army.It was discovered
by some of their own party.L1,000 reward was offered to whoever could
apprehend any of the thirty named.Most of those who were engaged in it,
were taken and secured.The Parliament, city, and all the nation,
congratulate the discovery; and votes and resolutions were passed that,
if King William should ever be assassinated, it should be revenged on
the <DW7>s and party through the nation; an Act of Association drawing
up to empower the Parliament to sit on any such accident, till the Crown
should be disposed of according to the late settlement at the
Revolution.All <DW7>s, in the meantime, to be banished ten miles from
London.This put the nation into an incredible disturbance and general
animosity against the French King and King James.The militia of the
nation was raised, several regiments were sent for out of Flanders, and
all things put in a posture to encounter a descent.This was so timed by
the enemy, that while we were already much discontented by the greatness
of the taxes, and corruption of the money, etc., we had like to have had
very few men-of-war near our coasts; but so it pleased God that Admiral
Rooke wanting a wind to pursue his voyage to the Straits, that squadron,
with others at Portsmouth and other places, were still in the Channel,
and were soon brought up to join with the rest of the ships which could
be got together, so that there is hope this plot may be broken.I look
on it as a very great deliverance and prevention by the providence of
God.Though many did formerly pity King James's condition, this design
of assassination and bringing over a French army, alienated many oL his
friends, and was likely to produce a more perfect establishment of King
William.The wind continuing N. and E. all this week, brought so
many of our men-of-war together that, though most of the French finding
their design detected and prevented, made a shift to get into Calais and
Dunkirk roads, we wanting fire-ships and bombs to disturb them; yet they
were so engaged among the sands and flats, that 'tis said they cut their
masts and flung their great guns overboard to lighten their vessels.French were to
have invaded at once England, Scotland, and Ireland.Divers of the conspirators tried and condemned.Vesuvius breaking out, terrified Naples.Three of the unhappy wretches,
whereof one was a priest, were executed[82] for intending to assassinate
the King; they acknowledged their intention, but acquitted King James of
inciting them to it, and died very penitent.Divers more in danger, and
some very considerable persons.[Footnote 82: Robert Charnock, Edward King, and Thomas Keys.][Sidenote: LONDON]

6th April, 1696.The quarters of Sir William Perkins and Sir John
Friend, lately executed on the plot, with Perkins's head, were set up at
Temple Bar, a dismal sight, which many pitied.I think there never was
such at Temple Bar till now, except once in the time of King Charles
II., namely, of Sir Thomas Armstrong.[83]

    [Footnote 83: He was concerned in the Rye-House plot, fled into
    Holland, was given up, and executed in his own country, 1684.Great offense taken at the three ministers who
absolved Sir William Perkins and Friend at Tyburn.One of them (Snatt)
was a son of my old schoolmaster.This produced much altercation as to
the canonicalness of the action.We had a meeting at Guildhall of the grand committee
about settling the draught of Greenwich hospital.I went to Eton, and dined with Dr.The schoolmaster assured me there had not been for twenty years
a more pregnant youth in that place than my grandson.I went to see the
King's House at Kensington.The
gallery furnished with the best pictures [from] all the houses, of
Titian, Raphael, Correggio, Holbein, Julio Romano, Bassan, Vandyke,
Tintoretto, and others; a great collection of porcelain; and a pretty
private library.His prayer before
the sermon was one of the most excellent compositions I ever heard.The Venetian Ambassador made a stately entry with
fifty footmen, many on horseback, four rich coaches, and a numerous
train of gallants.Oates
dedicated a most villainous, reviling book against King James, which he
presumed to present to King William, who could not but abhor it,
speaking so infamously and untruly of his late beloved Queen's own
father.I dined at Lambeth, being summoned to meet my co-trustees,
the Archbishop, Sir Henry Ashurst, and Mr.Serjeant Rotheram, to consult
about settling Mr.Boyle's lecture for a perpetuity; which we concluded
upon, by buying a rent charge of L50 per annum, with the stock in our
hands.I went to Lambeth, to meet at dinner the Countess of
Sunderland and divers ladies.We dined in the Archbishop's wife's
apartment with his Grace, and stayed late; yet I returned to Deptford at
night.I went to London to meet my son, newly come from
Ireland, indisposed.Money still continuing exceedingly scarce, so that
none was paid or received, but all was on trust, the mint not supplying
for common necessities.The Association with an oath required of all
lawyers and officers, on pain of _praemunire_, whereby men were obliged
to renounce King James as no rightful king, and to revenge King
William's death, if happening by assassination.This to be taken by all
the Counsel by a day limited, so that the Courts of Chancery and King's
Bench hardly heard any cause in Easter Term, so many crowded to take the
oath.This was censured as a very entangling contrivance of the
Parliament in expectation, that many in high office would lay down, and
others surrender.Many gentlemen taken up on suspicion of the late plot,
were now discharged out of prison.We settled divers offices, and other matters relating to
workmen, for the beginning of Greenwich hospital.[Sidenote: DEPTFORD]

1st June, 1696.I went to Deptford to dispose of our goods, in order to
letting the house for three years to Vice Admiral Benbow, with condition
to keep up the garden.A committee met at Whitehall about Greenwich Hospital,
at Sir Christopher Wren's, his Majesty's Surveyor-General.We made the
first agreement with divers workmen and for materials; and gave the
first order for proceeding on the foundation, and for weekly payments to
the workmen, and a general account to be monthly.Dined at Lord Pembroke's, Lord Privy Seal, a very
worthy gentleman.He showed me divers rare pictures of very many of the
old and best masters, especially one of M. Angelo of a man gathering
fruit to give to a woman, and a large book of the best drawings of the
old masters.Sir John Fenwick, one of the conspirators, was taken.Great
subscriptions in Scotland to their East India Company.Want of current
money to carry on the smallest concerns, even for daily provisions in
the markets.Guineas lowered to twenty-two shillings, and great sums
daily transported to Holland, where it yields more, with other treasure
sent to pay the armies, and nothing considerable coined of the new and
now only current stamp, cause such a scarcity that tumults are every day
feared, nobody paying or receiving money; so imprudent was the late
Parliament to condemn the old though clipped and corrupted, till they
had provided supplies.To this add the fraud of the bankers and
goldsmiths, who having gotten immense riches by extortion, keep up their
treasure in expectation of enhancing its value.Duncombe, not long since
a mean goldsmith, having made a purchase of the late Duke of
Buckingham's estate at nearly L90,000, and reputed to have nearly as
much in cash.Banks and lotteries every day set up.The famous trial between my Lord Bath and Lord Montague
for an estate of L11,000 a year, left by the Duke of Albemarle, wherein
on several trials had been spent,L20,000 between them.The Earl of Bath
was cast on evident forgery.I made my Lord Cheney a visit at Chelsea, and saw those
ingenious waterworks invented by Mr.Winstanley, wherein were some
things very surprising and extraordinary.An exceedingly rainy, cold, unseasonable summer, yet
the city was very healthy.A trial in the Common Pleas between the Lady Purbeck
Temple and Mr.Temple, a nephew of Sir Purbeck, concerning a deed set up
to take place of several wills.The
cause went on my lady's side.This concerning my son-in-law, Draper, I
stayed almost all day at Court.A great supper was given to the jury,
being persons of the best condition in Buckinghamshire.I went with a select committee of the Commissioners for
Greenwich Hospital, and with Sir Christopher Wren, where with him I laid
the first stone of the intended foundation, precisely at five o'clock in
the evening, after we had dined together.Flamstead, the King's
Astronomical Professor, observing the punctual time by instruments.Note that my Lord Godolphin was the first of the
subscribers who paid any money to this noble fabric.A northern wind altering the weather with a continual
and impetuous rain of three days and nights changed it into perfect
winter.So little money in the nation that Exchequer Tallies,
of which I had for L2,000 on the best fund in England, the Post Office,
nobody would take at 30 per cent discount.The Bank lending the L200,000 to pay the array in
Flanders, that had done nothing against the enemy, had so exhausted the
treasure of the nation, that one could not have borrowed money under 14
or 15 per cent on bills, or on Exchequer Tallies under 30 per cent.I went to Lambeth and dined with the
Archbishop, who had been at Court on the complaint against Dr.David's, who was suspended for simony.The
Archbishop told me how unsatisfied he was with the Canon law, and how
exceedingly unreasonable all their pleadings appeared to him.Fine seasonable weather, and a great harvest after a
cold, wet summer.I went to congratulate the marriage of a daughter
of Mr.Boscawen to the son of Sir Philip Meadows; she is niece to my
Lord Godolphin, married at Lambeth by the Archbishop, 30th of August.After above six months' stay in London about Greenwich Hospital, I
returned to Wotton.Unseasonable stormy weather, and an ill seedtime.Lord Godolphin retired from the Treasury, who was the
first Commissioner and most skillful manager of all.The first frost began fiercely, but lasted not long.15th-23d November, 1696.Very stormy weather, rain, and inundations.The severe frost and weather relented, but again
froze with snow.Sir John
Fenwick was beheaded.Soldiers in the
armies and garrison towns frozen to death on their posts.I came to Wotton after three months' absence.Very bright weather, but with sharp east wind.My son
came from London in his melancholy indisposition.Duncombe, the rector, came and preached after
an absence of two years, though only living seven or eight miles off [at
Ashted].So great were the storms all this week, that near a
thousand people were lost going into the Texel.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th November, 1697.The King's entry very pompous; but is nothing
approaching that of King Charles II.Thanksgiving Day for the Peace, the King and a great
Court at Whitehall.The Bishop of Salisbury preached, or rather made a
florid panegyric, on 2 Chron.The evening concluded with

chief gentlemen of Surrey, to present their address to the King.The
Duke of Norfolk promised to introduce it, but came so late, that it was
presented before be came.This insignificant ceremony was brought in in
Cromwell's time, and has ever since continued with offers of life and
fortune to whoever happened to have the power.I dined at Sir Richard
Onslow's, who treated almost all the gentlemen of Surrey.When we had
half dined, the Duke of Norfolk came in to make his excuse.At the Temple Church; it was very long before the
service began, staying for the Comptroller of the Inner Temple, where
was to be kept a riotous and reveling Christmas, according to custom.Bentley, about the Library at
St.A great Christmas kept at Wotton, open house, much company.I
presented my book of Medals, etc., to divers noblemen, before I exposed
it to sale.Fulham, who lately married my niece, preached
against atheism, a very eloquent discourse, somewhat improper for most
of the audience at [Wotton], but fitted for some other place, and very
apposite to the profane temper of the age.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th January, 1698.Whitehall burned, nothing but walls and ruins left.The imprisonment of the great banker, Duncombe:
censured by Parliament; acquitted by the Lords; sent again to the Tower
by the Commons.The Czar of Muscovy being come to England, and having a mind to see the
building of ships, hired my house at Sayes Court, and made it his court
and palace, newly furnished for him by the King.[84]

    [Footnote 84: While the Czar was in his house.Evelyn's servant
    writes to him: "There is a house full of people, and right nasty.The Czar lies next your library, and dines in the parlor next your
    study.He dines at ten o'clock and at six at night; is very seldom
    at home a whole day; very often in the King's yard, or by water,
    dressed in several dresses.The King is expected here this day; the
    best parlor is pretty clean for him to be entertained in.The King
    pays for all he has."]The Czar went from my house to return home.An
exceedingly sharp and cold season.An extraordinary great snow and frost, nipping the corn
and other fruits.Corn at nine shillings a bushel [L18 a load].Pepys's, where I heard the rare voice of
Mr.Pule, who was lately come from Italy, reputed the most excellent
singer we had ever had.White, late Bishop of Norwich, who had been ejected
for not complying with Government, was buried in St.Gregory's
churchyard, or vault, at St.His hearse was accompanied by two
non-juror bishops, Dr.Lloyd, with forty other
non-juror clergymen, who would not stay the Office of the burial,
because the Dean of St.Paul's had appointed a conforming minister to
read the Office; at which all much wondered, there being nothing in that
Office which mentioned the present King.Godolphin
with the Earl of Marlborough's daughter.To Deptford, to see how miserably the Czar had left my
house, after three months making it his Court.I got Sir Christopher
Wren, the King's surveyor, and Mr.London, his gardener, to go and
estimate the repairs, for which they allowed L150 in their report to the
Lords of the Treasury.I then went to see the foundation of the Hall and
Chapel at Greenwich Hospital.I dined with Pepys, where was Captain Dampier,[85] who
had been a famous buccaneer, had brought hither the painted Prince Job,
and printed a relation of his very strange adventure, and his
observations.He was now going abroad again by the King's encouragement,
who furnished a ship of 290 tons.He seemed a more modest man than one
would imagine by the relation of the crew he had assorted with.He
brought a map of his observations of the course of the winds in the
South Sea, and assured us that the maps hitherto extant were all false
as to the Pacific Sea, which he makes on the south of the line, that on
the north end running by the coast of Peru being extremely tempestuous.[Footnote 85: The celebrated navigator, born in 1652, the time of
    whose death is uncertain.His "Voyage Round the World" has gone
    through many editions, and the substance of it has been transferred
    to many collections of voyages.]Foy came to me to use my interest with Lord
Sunderland for his being made Professor of Physic at Oxford, in the
King's gift.I went also to the Archbishop in his behalf.Being one of the Council of the Royal Society, I was
named to be of the committee to wait on our new President, the Lord
Chancellor, our Secretary, Dr.Sloane, and Sir R. Southwell, last
Vice-President, carrying our book of statutes; the office of the
President being read, his Lordship subscribed his name, and took the
oaths according to our statutes as a Corporation for the improvement of
natural knowledge.Then his Lordship made a short compliment concerning
the honor the Society had done him, and how ready he would be to promote
so noble a design, and come himself among us, as often as the attendance
on the public would permit; and so we took our leave.She was daughter to Sir
John Evelyn, of Wilts, my father's nephew; she was widow to William
Pierrepoint, brother to the Marquis of Dorchester, and mother to Evelyn
Pierrepoint, Earl of Kingston; a most excellent and prudent lady.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The House of Commons persist in refusing more than 7,000 men to be a
standing army, and no strangers to be in the number.Our county member, Sir R. Onslow, opposed it also; which
might reconcile him to the people, who began to suspect him.Mander, the
Master of Baliol College, where he was entered a fellow-commoner.A most furious wind, such as has not happened for
many years, doing great damage to houses and trees, by the fall of which
several persons were killed.The old East India Company lost their business against
the new Company, by ten votes in Parliament, so many of their friends
being absent, going to see a tiger baited by dogs.The persecuted Vaudois, who were banished out of Savoy, were received by
the German Protestant Princes.My only remaining son died after a tedious languishing
sickness, contracted in Ireland, and increased here, to my exceeding
grief and affliction; leaving me one grandson, now at Oxford, whom I
pray God to prosper and be the support of the Wotton family.He was aged
forty-four years and about three months.He had been six years one of
the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland, with great ability and
reputation.After an extraordinary storm, there came up the Thames
a whale which was fifty-six feet long.Such, and a larger of the spout
kind, was killed there forty years ago (June 1658).My deceased son was buried in the vault at Wotton,
according to his desire.The Duke of Devon lost L1,900 at a horse race at Newmarket.The King preferring his young favorite Earl of Albemarle to be first
Commander of his Guard, the Duke of Ormond laid down his commission.This of the Dutch Lord passing over his head, was exceedingly resented
by everybody.Lord Spencer purchased an incomparable library[86] of...
wherein, among other rare books, were several that were printed at the
first invention of that wonderful art, as particularly "Tully's Offices,
etc."There was a Homer and a Suidas in a very good Greek character and
good paper, almost as ancient.This gentleman is a very fine scholar,
whom from a child I have known.[Footnote 86: The foundation of the noble library now at Blenheim.]I dined with the Archbishop; but my business was to
get him to persuade the King to purchase the late Bishop of Worcester's
library, and build a place for his own library at St.James's, in the
Park, the present one being too small.At a meeting of the Royal Society I was nominated to be of
the committee to wait on the Lord Chancellor to move the King to
purchase the Bishop of Worcester's library (Dr.The Court party have little influence in this Session.The Duke of Ormond restored to his commission.All
Lotteries, till now cheating the people, to be no longer permitted than
to Christmas, except that for the benefit of Greenwich Hospital.Bridgman, chairman of the committee for that charitable work, died; a
great loss to it.He was Clerk of the Council, a very industrious,
useful man.John Moore,[87] Bishop of Norwich,
one of the best and most ample collection of all sorts of good books in
England, and he, one of the most learned men.[Footnote 87: Afterward Bishop of Ely.He died 31st of July, 1714.King George I. purchased this library after the Bishop's death, for
    L6,000, and presented it to the University of Cambridge, where it
    now is.]After a long drought, we had a refreshing shower.The
day before, there was a dreadful fire at Rotherhithe, near the Thames
side, which burned divers ships, and consumed nearly three hundred
houses.Now died the famous Duchess of Mazarin; she had been the richest
lady in Europe.She was niece of Cardinal Mazarin, and was married to
the richest subject in Europe, as is said.She was born at Rome,
educated in France, and was an extraordinary beauty and wit but
dissolute and impatient of matrimonial restraint, so as to be abandoned
by her husband, and banished, when she came into England for shelter,
lived on a pension given her here, and is reported to have hastened her
death by intemperate drinking strong spirits.She has written her own
story and adventures, and so has her other extravagant sister, wife to
the noble family of Colonna.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th June, 1699.This week died Conyers Seymour, son of Sir Edward
Seymour, killed in a duel caused by a slight affront in St.James's
Park, given him by one who was envious of his gallantries; for he was a
vain, foppish young man, who made a great _eclat_ about town by his
splendid equipage and boundless expense.He was about twenty-three years
old; his brother, now at Oxford, inherited an estate of L7,000 a year,
which had fallen to him not two years before.My cousin, George Evelyn, of Nutfield, died suddenly.The heat has been so great, almost all this month, that
I do not remember to have felt much greater in Italy, and this after a
winter the wettest, though not the coldest, that I remember for fifty
years last past.Finding my occasions called me so often to London, I
took the remainder of the lease my son had in a house in Dover Street,
to which I now removed, not taking my goods from Wotton.Seasonable showers, after a continuance of excessive
drought and heat.At Deptford, they had
been building a pretty new church.David's [Watson]
deprived for simony.[88] The city of Moscow burnt by the throwing of
squibs.[Footnote 88: _Ante_, p.There was in this week an eclipse of the sun, at
which many were frightened by the predictions of the astrologers.I
remember fifty years ago that many were so terrified by Lilly, that they
dared not go out of their houses.A strange earthquake at New Batavia,
in the East Indies.My worthy brother died at Wotton, in the 83d year of
his age, of perfect memory and understanding.He was religious, sober,
and temperate, and of so hospitable a nature, that no family in the
county maintained that ancient custom of keeping, as it were, open house
the whole year in the same manner, or gave more noble or free
entertainment to the county on all occasions, so that his house was
never free.There were sometimes twenty persons more than his family,
and some that stayed there all the summer, to his no small expense; by
this he gained the universal love of the county.He was born at Wotton,
went from the free school at Guildford to Trinity College, Oxford,
thence to the Middle Temple, as gentlemen of the best quality did, but
without intention to study the law as a profession.He married the
daughter of Colwall, of a worthy and ancient family in Leicestershire,
by whom he had one son; she dying in 1643, left George her son an
infant, who being educated liberally, after traveling abroad, returned
and married one Mrs.Gore, by whom he had several children, but only
three daughters survived.He was a young man of good understanding, but,
over-indulging his ease and pleasure, grew so very corpulent, contrary
to the constitution of the rest of his father's relations, that he died.My brother afterward married a noble and honorable lady, relict of Sir
John Cotton, she being an Offley, a worthy and ancient Staffordshire
family, by whom he had several children of both sexes.This lady died,
leaving only two daughters and a son.The younger daughter died before
marriage; the other afterward married Sir Cyril Wych, a noble and
learned gentleman (son of Sir ---- Wych), who had been Ambassador at
Constantinople, and was afterward made one of the Lords Justices of
Ireland.Before this marriage, her only brother married the daughter of
---- Eversfield, of Sussex, of an honorable family, but left a widow
without any child living; he died about 1691, and his wife not many
years after, and my brother resettled the whole estate on me.His
sister, Wych, had a portion of L6,000, to which was added L300 more; the
three other daughters, with what I added, had about L5,000 each.My
brother died on the 5th of October, in a good old age and great
reputation, making his beloved daughter, Lady Wych, sole executrix,
leaving me only his library and some pictures of my father, mother, etc.She buried him with extraordinary solemnity, rather as a nobleman than
as a private gentleman.There were, as I computed, above 2,000 persons
at the funeral, all the gentlemen of the county doing him the last
honors.I returned to London, till my lady should dispose of herself and
family.After an unusual warm and pleasant season, we were
surprised with a very sharp frost.I presented my "_Acetaria_,"
dedicated to my Lord Chancellor, who returned me thanks in an
extraordinarily civil letter.There happened this week so thick a mist and fog,
that people lost their way in the streets, it being so intense that no
light of candles, or torches, yielded any (or but very little)
direction.Robberies were committed between
the very lights which were fixed between London and Kensington on both
sides, and while coaches and travelers were passing.It began about four
in the afternoon, and was quite gone by eight, without any wind to
disperse it.At the Thames, they beat drums to direct the watermen to
make the shore.At our chapel in the evening there was a sermon
preached by young Mr.Horneck, chaplain to Lord Guilford, whose lady's
funeral had been celebrated magnificently the Thursday before.A
panegyric was now pronounced, describing the extraordinary piety and
excellently employed life of this amiable young lady.She died in
childbed a few days before, to the excessive sorrow of her husband, who
ordered the preacher to declare that it was on her exemplary life,
exhortations and persuasion, that he totally changed the course of his
life, which was before in great danger of being perverted; following the
mode of this dissolute age.Her devotion, early piety, charity,
fastings, economy, disposition of her time in reading, praying,
recollections in her own handwriting of what she heard and read, and her
conversation were most exemplary.Blackwell's election to be the next
year's Boyles Lecturer.Such horrible robberies and murders were committed, as had not been
known in this nation; atheism, profaneness, blasphemy, among all sorts,
portended some judgment if not amended; on which a society was set on
foot, who obliged themselves to endeavor the reforming of it, in London
and other places, and began to punish offenders and put the laws in more
strict execution; which God Almighty prosper!A gentle, calm, dry,
temperate weather all this season of the year, but now came sharp, hard
frost, and mist, but calm.Calm, bright, and warm as in the middle of April.So
continued on 21st of January.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The Parliament reverses the prodigious donations of the Irish
forfeitures, which were intended to be set apart for discharging the
vast national debt.They called some great persons in the highest
offices in question for setting the Great Seal to the pardon of an
arch-pirate,[89] who had turned pirate again, and brought prizes into
the West Indies, suspected to be connived at on sharing the prey; but
the prevailing part in the House called Courtiers, out-voted the
complaints, not by being more in number, but by the country party being
negligent in attendance.[Footnote 89: Captain Kidd; he was hanged about two years afterward
    with some of his accomplices.This was one of the charges brought by
    the Commons against Lord Somers.]14th January, 1699-1700.Stringfellow, who had been made the first preacher at our chapel by
the Bishop of Lincoln [Dr.Tenison, now Archbishop], while he held St.Martin's by dispensation, and put in one Mr.Sandys, much against the
inclination of those who frequented the chapel.The Scotch book about
Darien was burned by the hangman by vote of Parliament.[90]

    [Footnote 90: The volume alluded to was "An Enquiry into the Causes
    of the Miscarriage of the Scots Colony at Darien: Or an Answer to a
    Libel," entitled "A Defense of the Scots abdicating Darien."See
    Votes of the House of Commons, 15th January, 1699-1700.]Died the Duke of Beaufort, a person of great honor,
prudence, and estate.I went to Wotton, the first time after my brother's
funeral, to furnish the house with necessaries, Lady Wych and my nephew
Glanville, the executors having sold and disposed of what goods were
there of my brother's.The weather was now altering into sharp and hard
frost.[Sidenote: LONDON]

One Stephens, who preached before the House of Commons on King Charles's
Martyrdom, told them that the observation of that day was not intended
out of any detestation of his murder, but to be a lesson to other Kings
and Rulers, how they ought to behave themselves toward their subjects,
lest they should come to the same end.This was so resented that, though
it was usual to desire these anniversary sermons to be printed, they
refused thanks to him, and ordered that in future no one should preach
before them, who was not either a Dean or a Doctor of Divinity.The Parliament voted against the Scots settling in
Darien as being prejudicial to our trade with Spain.They also voted
that the exorbitant number of attorneys be lessened (now indeed
swarming, and evidently causing lawsuits and disturbance, eating out the
estates of the people, provoking them to go to law).Mild and calm season, with gentle frost, and little
mizzling rain.Martin's frequently preached at Trinity
chapel in the afternoon.The season was like April for warmth and
mildness.--11th.On Wednesday, was a sermon at our chapel, to be
continued during Lent.I was at the funeral of my Lady Temple, who was buried
at Islington, brought from Addiscombe, near Croydon.She left my
son-in-law Draper (her nephew) the mansion house of Addiscombe, very
nobly and completely furnished, with the estate about it, with plate and
jewels, to the value in all of about L20,000.She was a very prudent
lady, gave many great legacies, with L500 to the poor of Islington,
where her husband, Sir Purbeck Temple, was buried, both dying without
issue.The season warm, gentle, and exceedingly pleasant.Divers persons of quality entered into the Society for Reformation[91]
of Manners; and some lectures were set up, particularly in the city of
London.The most eminent of the clergy preached at Bow Church, after
reading a declaration set forth by the King to suppress the growing
wickedness; this began already to take some effect as to common
swearing, and oaths in the mouths of people of all ranks.[Footnote 91: _Ante_, p.Burnet preached to-day before the Lord Mayor and a
very great congregation, on Proverbs xxvii.5, 6, "Open rebuke is better
than secret love; the wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of
an enemy."He made a very pathetic discourse concerning the necessity
and advantage of friendly correction.The Duke of Norfolk now succeeded in obtaining a divorce
from his wife by the Parliament for adultery with Sir John Germaine, a
Dutch gamester, of mean extraction, who had got much by gaming; the Duke
had leave to marry again, so that if he should have children, the
Dukedom will go from the late Lord Thomas's children, <DW7>s indeed,
but very hopeful and virtuous gentlemen, as was their father.The now
Duke their uncle is a Protestant.The Parliament nominated fourteen persons to go into Ireland as
commissioners to dispose of the forfeited estates there, toward payment
of the debts incurred by the late war, but which the King had in great
measure given to some of his favorites of both sexes, Dutch and others
of little merit, and very unseasonably.That this might be done without
suspicion of interest in the Parliament, it was ordered that no member
of either House should be in the commission.The great contest between
the Lords and Commons concerning the Lords' power of amendments and
rejecting bills tacked to the money bill, carried for the Commons.However, this tacking of bills is a novel practice, suffered by King
Charles II., who, being continually in want of money, let anything pass
rather than not have wherewith to feed his extravagance.This was
carried but by one voice in the Lords, all the Bishops following the
Court, save one; so that near sixty bills passed, to the great triumph
of the Commons and Country party, but high regret of the Court, and
those to whom the King had given large estates in Ireland.Pity it is,
that things should be brought to this extremity, the government of this
nation being so equally poised between King and subject; but we are
satisfied with nothing; and, while there is no perfection on this side
heaven, methinks both might be contented without straining things too
far.Among the rest, there passed a law as to <DW7>s' estates, that if
one turned not Protestant before eighteen years of age, it should pass
to his next Protestant heir.This indeed seemed a hard law, but not only
the usage of the French King to his Protestant subjects, but the
indiscreet insolence of the <DW7>s here, going in triumphant and public
processions with their Bishops, with banners and trumpets in divers
places (as is said) in the northern counties, has brought it on their
party.This week there was a great change of State officers.The Duke of Shrewsbury resigned his Lord Chamberlainship to the Earl of
Jersey, the Duke's indisposition requiring his retreat.Vernon,
Secretary of State, was put out.The Seal was taken from the Lord
Chancellor Somers, though he had been acquitted by a great majority of
votes for what was charged against him in the House of Commons.This
being in term time, put some stop to business, many eminent lawyers
refusing to accept the office, considering the uncertainty of things in
this fluctuating conjuncture.It is certain that this Chancellor was a
most excellent lawyer, very learned in all polite literature, a superior
pen, master of a handsome style, and of easy conversation; but he is
said to make too much haste to be rich, as his predecessor, and most in
place in this age did, to a more prodigious excess than was ever known.But the Commons had now so mortified the Court party, and property and
liberty were so much invaded in all the neighboring kingdoms, that their
jealousy made them cautious, and every day strengthened the law which
protected the people from tyranny.A most glorious spring, with hope of abundance of fruit of all kinds,
and a propitious year.The great trial between Sir Walter Clarges and Mr.Sherwin concerning the legitimacy of the late Duke of Albemarle, on
which depended an estate of L1,500 a year; the verdict was given for Sir
Walter, 19th.Serjeant Wright at last accepted the Great Seal.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

24th May, 1700.I went from Dover street to Wotton, for the rest of the
summer, and removed thither the rest of my goods from Sayes Court.A sweet season, with a mixture of refreshing showers.In the afternoon, our clergyman had a catechism,
which was continued for some time.I was visited with illness, but it pleased God that I
recovered, for which praise be ascribed to him by me, and that he has
again so graciously advertised me of my duty to prepare for my latter
end, which at my great age, cannot be far off.The Duke of Gloucester, son of the Princess Anne of Denmark, died of the
smallpox.I went to Harden, which was originally a barren warren
bought by Sir Robert Clayton, who built there a pretty house, and made
such alteration by planting not only an infinite store of the best
fruit; but so changed the natural situation of the hill, valleys, and
solitary mountains about it, that it rather represented some foreign
country, which would produce spontaneously pines, firs, cypress, yew,
holly, and juniper; they were come to their perfect growth, with walks,
mazes, etc., among them, and were preserved with the utmost care, so
that I who had seen it some years before in its naked and barren
condition, was in admiration of it.The land was bought of Sir John
Evelyn, of Godstone, and was thus improved for pleasure and retirement
by the vast charge and industry of this opulent citizen.He and his lady
received us with great civility.The tombs in the church at Croydon of
Archbishops Grindal, Whitgift, and other Archbishops, are fine and
venerable; but none comparable to that of the late Archbishop Sheldon,
which, being all of white marble, and of a stately ordinance and
carvings, far surpassed the rest, and I judge could not cost less than
L700 or L800.I went to Beddington, the ancient seat of the
Carews, in my remembrance a noble old structure, capacious, and in form
of the buildings of the age of Henry VIII.and Queen Elizabeth, and
proper for the old English hospitality, but now decaying with the house
itself, heretofore adorned with ample gardens, and the first orange
trees[92] that had been seen in England, planted in the open ground, and
secured in winter only by a tabernacle of boards and stoves removable in
summer, that, standing 120 years, large and goodly trees, and laden with
fruit, were now in decay, as well as the grotto, fountains, cabinets,
and other curiosities in the house and abroad, it being now fallen to a
child under age, and only kept by a servant or two from utter
dilapidation.The estate and park about it also in decay.[Footnote 92: Oranges were eaten in this kingdom much earlier than
    the time of King James I.]Pepys at Clapham, where he has
a very noble and wonderfully well-furnished house, especially with
Indian and Chinese curiosities.The offices and gardens well
accommodated for pleasure and retirement.My birthday now completed the 80th year of my age.I
with my soul render thanks to God, who, of his infinite mercy, not only
brought me out of many troubles, but this year restored me to health,
after an ague and other infirmities of so great an age; my sight,
hearing, and other senses and faculties tolerable, which I implore him
to continue, with the pardon of my sins past, and grace to acknowledge
by my improvement of his goodness the ensuing year, if it be his
pleasure to protract my life, that I may be the better prepared for my
last day, through the infinite merits of my blessed Savior, the Lord
Jesus, Amen!Came the news of my dear grandson (the only male of
my family now remaining) being fallen ill of the smallpox at Oxford,
which after the dire effects of it in my family exceedingly afflicted
me; but so it pleased my most merciful God that being let blood at his
first complaint, and by the extraordinary care of Dr.Mander (Head of
the college and now Vice Chancellor), who caused him to be brought and
lodged in his own bed and bedchamber, with the advice of his physician
and care of his tutor, there were all fair hopes of his recovery, to our
infinite comfort.We had a letter every day either from the Vice
Chancellor himself, or his tutor.Assurance of his recovery by a letter from himself.[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was a change of great officers at Court.Lord Godolphin returned
to his former station of first Commissioner of the Treasury; Sir Charles
Hedges, Secretary of State.At the Royal Society, Lord Somers, the late
Chancellor, was continued President.Great alterations of officers at Court, and
elsewhere,--Lord Chief Justice Treby died; he was a learned man in his
profession, of which we have now few, never fewer; the Chancery
requiring so little skill in deep law-learning, if the practicer can
talk eloquently in that Court; so that probably few care to study the
law to any purpose.Lord Marlborough Master of the Ordnance, in place of
Lord Romney made Groom of the Stole.The Earl of Rochester goes Lord
Lieutenant to Ireland.I finished the sale of North Stoake in Sussex to
Robert Michell, Esq., appointed by my brother to be sold for payment of
portions to my nieces, and other incumbrances on the estate.An exceeding deep snow, and melted away as suddenly.Severe frost, and such a tempest as threw down many
chimneys, and did great spoil at sea, and blew down above twenty trees
of mine at Wotton.Harley, an able
gentleman, chosen.Our countryman, Sir Richard Onslow, had a party for
him.By an order of the House of Commons, I laid before
the Speaker the state of what had been received and paid toward the
building of Greenwich Hospital.Wye, Rector of Wotton, died, a very worthy good man.Bohun, a learned person and excellent preacher, who had been my
son's tutor, and lived long in my family.I let Sayes Court to Lord Carmarthen, son to the Duke
of Leeds.I went to the funeral of my sister Draper, who was
buried at Edmonton in great state.Davenant displeased the clergy
now met in Convocation by a passage in his book, p.A Dutch boy of about eight or nine years old was carried
about by his parents to show, who had about the iris of one eye the
letters of _Deus meus_, and of the other _Elohim_, in the Hebrew
character.How this was done by artifice none could imagine; his parents
affirming that he was so born.It did not prejudice his sight, and he
seemed to be a lively playing boy.Everybody went to see him; physicians
and philosophers examined it with great accuracy; some considered it as
artificial, others as almost supernatural.The Duke of Norfolk died of an apoplexy, and Mr.Thomas
Howard of complicated disease since his being cut for the stone; he was
one of the Tellers of the Exchequer.Some Kentish men, delivering a petition to the House of
Commons, were imprisoned.[93]

    [Footnote 93: Justinian Champneys, Thomas Culpepper, William
    Culpepper, William Hamilton, and David Polhill, gentlemen of
    considerable property and family in the county.There is a very good
    print of them in five ovals on one plate, engraved by R. White, in
    1701.They desired the Parliament to mind the public more, and their
    private heats less.They were confined till the prorogation, and
    were much visited.A great dearth, no considerable rain having fallen for some months.Very plentiful showers, the wind coming west and south.The Bishops and Convocation at difference concerning the right of

20th June, 1701.The Commons demanded a conference with the Lords on the
trial of Lord Somers, which the Lords refused, and proceeding on the
trial, the Commons would not attend, and he was acquitted.I went to congratulate the arrival of that worthy and
excellent person my Lord Galway, newly come out of Ireland, where he had
behaved himself so honestly, and to the exceeding satisfaction of the
people: but he was removed thence for being a Frenchman, though they had
not a more worthy, valiant, discreet, and trusty person in the two
kingdoms, on whom they could have relied for his conduct and fitness.He
was one who had deeply suffered, as well as the Marquis, his father, for
being Protestants.My Lord Treasurer made my grandson one of the Commissioners
of the prizes, salary L500 per annum.My grandson went to Sir Simon Harcourt, the
Solicitor-General, to Windsor, to wait on my Lord Treasurer.There had
been for some time a proposal of marrying my grandson to a daughter of
Mrs.Boscawen, sister of my Lord Treasurer, which was now far advanced.I subscribed toward rebuilding Oakwood Chapel, now,
after 200 years, almost fallen down.The weather changed from heat not much less than in Italy
or Spain for some few days, to wet, dripping, and cold, with
intermissions of fair.I went to Kensington, and saw the house,
plantations, and gardens, the work of Mr.Wise, who was there to receive
me.The death of King James, happening on the 15th of this month, N. S.,
after two or three days' indisposition, put an end to that unhappy
Prince's troubles, after a short and unprosperous reign, indiscreetly
attempting to bring in Popery, and make himself absolute, in imitation
of the French, hurried on by the impatience of the Jesuits; which the
nation would not endure.Died the Earl of Bath, whose contest with Lord Montague about the Duke
of Albemarle's estate, claiming under a will supposed to have been
forged, is said to have been worth L10,000 to the lawyers.His eldest
son shot himself a few days after his father's death; for what cause is
not clear.He was a most hopeful young man, and had behaved so bravely
against the Turks at the siege of Vienna, that the Emperor made him a
Count of the Empire.It was falsely reported that Sir Edward Seymour was
dead, a great man; he had often been Speaker, Treasurer of the Navy, and
in many other lucrative offices.He was of a hasty spirit, not at all
sincere, but head of the party at any time prevailing in Parliament.I kept my first courts in Surrey, which took up
the whole week.Hervey, a Counsellor, Justice of
Peace, and Member of Parliament, and my neighbor.I gave him six
guineas, which was a guinea a day, and to Mr.Martin, his clerk, three
guineas.I was this day 81 complete, in tolerable health,
considering my great age.I gave my vote and
interest to Sir R. Onslow and Mr.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1701-02.At the Royal Society there was read and approved
the delineation and description of my Tables of Veins and Arteries, by
Mr.Cooper, the chirurgeon, in order to their being engraved.The King had a fall from his horse, and broke his
collar bone, and having been much indisposed before, and aguish, with a
long cough and other weakness, died this Sunday morning, about four
o'clock.I carried my accounts of Greenwich Hospital to the Committee.My brother-in-law, Glanville, departed this life this
morning after a long languishing illness, leaving a son by my sister,
and two granddaughters.Our relation and friendship had been long and
great.He died in the 84th year of his
age, and willed his body to be wrapped in lead and carried down to
Greenwich, put on board a ship, and buried in the sea, between Dover and
Calais, about the Goodwin sands; which was done on the Tuesday, or
Wednesday after.This occasioned much discourse, he having no relation
at all to the sea.He was a gentleman of an ancient family in
Devonshire, and married my sister Jane.By his prudent parsimony he much
improved his fortune.He had a place in the Alienation Office, and might
have been an extraordinary man, had he cultivated his parts.My steward at Wotton gave a very honest account of what he had laid out
on repairs, amounting to L1,900.The report of the committee sent to examine the state of
Greenwich hospital was delivered to the House of Commons, much to their
satisfaction.Being elected a member of the Society lately incorporated for the
propagation of the Gospel in foreign parts, I subscribed L10 per annum
toward the carrying it on.We agreed that every missioner, besides the
L20 to set him forth, should have L50 per annum out of the stock of the
Corporation, till his settlement was worth to him L100 per annum.We
sent a young divine to New York.I dined at the Archbishop's with the newly made Bishop
of Carlisle, Dr.Nicolson, my worthy and learned correspondent.I went to Wotton with my family for the rest of the
summer, and my son-in-law, Draper, with his family, came to stay with
us, his house at Addiscombe being new-building, so that my family was
above thirty.Most of the new Parliament were chosen of Church of
England principles, against the peevish party.The Queen was
magnificently entertained at Oxford and all the towns she passed through
on her way to Bath.Arrived now to the 82d year of my age, having read
over all that passed since this day twelvemonth in these notes, I render
solemn thanks to the Lord, imploring the pardon of my past sins, and the
assistance of his grace; making new resolutions, and imploring that he
will continue his assistance, and prepare me for my blessed Savior's
coming, that I may obtain a comfortable departure, after so long a term
as has been hitherto indulged me.I find by many infirmities this year
(especially nephritic pains) that I much decline; and yet of his
infinite mercy retain my intellect and senses in great measure above
most of my age.I have this year repaired much of the mansion house and
several tenants' houses, and paid some of my debts and engagements.My
wife, children, and family in health: for all which I most sincerely
beseech Almighty God to accept of these my acknowledgments, and that if
it be his holy will to continue me yet longer, it may be to the praise
of his infinite grace, and salvation of my soul.My kinsman, John Evelyn, of Nutfield, a young and
very hopeful gentleman, and Member of Parliament, after having come to
Wotton to see me, about fifteen days past, went to London and there died
of the smallpox.He left a brother, a commander in the army in Holland,
to inherit a fair estate.Our affairs in so prosperous a condition both by sea and land, that
there has not been so great an union in Parliament, Court, and people,
in memory of man, which God in mercy make us thankful for, and continue!The Bishop of Exeter preached before the Queen and both Houses of
Parliament at St.Paul's; they were wonderfully huzzaed in their
passage, and splendidly entertained in the city.The expectation now is, what treasure will be found on
breaking bulk of the galleon brought from Vigo by Sir George Rooke,
which being made up in an extraordinary manner in the hold, was not
begun to be opened till the fifth of this month, before two of the Privy
Council, two of the chief magistrates of the city, and the Lord
Treasurer.After the excess of honor conferred by the Queen on the Earl of
Marlborough, by making him a Knight of the Garter and a Duke, for the
success of but one campaign, that he should desire L5,000 a year to be
settled on him by Parliament out of the Post Office, was thought a bold
and unadvised request, as he had, besides his own considerable estate,
above L30,000 a year in places and employments, with L50,000 at
interest.He had married one daughter to the son of my Lord Treasurer
Godolphin, another to the Earl of Sunderland, and a third to the Earl of
Bridgewater.He is a very handsome person, well-spoken and affable, and
supports his want of acquired knowledge by keeping good company.News of Vice-Admiral Benbow's conflict with the French
fleet in the West Indies, in which he gallantly behaved himself, and was
wounded, and would have had extraordinary success, had not four of his
men-of-war stood spectators without coming to his assistance; for this,
two of their commanders were tried by a Council of War, and
executed;[94] a third was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, loss of
pay, and incapacity to serve in future.[Footnote 94: The Captains Kirby and Wade, having been tried and
    condemned to die by a court-martial held on them in the West Indies,
    were sent home in the "Bristol;" and, on its arrival at Portsmouth
    were both shot on board, not being suffered to land on English
    ground.]Oglethorpe (son of the late Sir Theo.fought on occasion of some words which passed at a committee of the
House.Oglethorpe was disarmed.The Bill against occasional
conformity was lost by one vote.Corn and provisions so cheap that the
farmers are unable to pay their rents.[Sidenote: LONDON]

February, 1703.A famous cause at the King's Bench between Mr.Fenwick
and his wife, which went for him with a great estate.The Duke of
Marlborough lost his only son at Cambridge by the smallpox.A great
earthquake at Rome, etc.A famous young woman, an Italian, was hired by
our comedians to sing on the stage, during so many plays, for which they
gave her L500; which part by her voice alone at the end of three scenes
she performed with such modesty and grace, and above all with such
skill, that there was never any who did anything comparable with their
voices.She was to go home to the Court of the King of Prussia, and I
believe carried with her out of this vain nation above L1,000, everybody
coveting to hear her at their private houses.Samuel Pepys, a very worthy,
industrious and curious person, none in England exceeding him in
knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed through all the most
considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty,
all which he performed with great integrity.went
out of England, he laid down his office, and would serve no more; but
withdrawing himself from all public affairs, he lived at Clapham with
his partner, Mr.Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble house and
sweet place, where he enjoyed the fruit of his labors in great
prosperity.He was universally beloved, hospitable, generous, learned in
many things, skilled in music, a very great cherisher of learned men of
whom he had the conversation.His library and collection of other
curiosities were of the most considerable, the models of ships
especially.Besides what he published of an account of the navy, as he
found and left it, he had for divers years under his hand the History of
the Navy, or _Navalia_, as he called it; but how far advanced, and what
will follow of his, is left, I suppose, to his sister's son, Mr.Pepys had educated in all sorts of
useful learning, sending him to travel abroad, from whence he returned
with extraordinary accomplishments, and worthy to be heir.Pepys had
been for near forty years so much my particular friend, that Mr.Jackson
sent me complete mourning, desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at
his magnificent obsequies; but my indisposition hindered me from doing
him this last office.Rains have been great and continual, and now, near
midsummer, cold and wet.I went to Addiscombe, sixteen miles from Wotton, to
see my son-in-law's new house, the outside, to the coving, being such
excellent brickwork, based with Portland stone, with the pilasters,
windows, and within, that I pronounced it in all the points of good and
solid architecture to be one of the very best gentlemen's houses in
Surrey, when finished.I returned to Wotton in the evening, though
weary.The last week in this month an uncommon long-continued
rain, and the Sunday following, thunder and lightning.The new Commission for Greenwich hospital was sealed
and opened, at which my son-in-law, Draper, was present, to whom I
resigned my office of Treasurer.From August 1696, there had been
expended in building L89,364 14s.This day, being eighty-three years of age, upon
examining what concerned me, more particularly the past year, with the
great mercies of God preserving me, and in the same measure making my
infirmities tolerable, I gave God most hearty and humble thanks,
beseeching him to confirm to me the pardon of my sins past, and to
prepare me for a better life by the virtue of his grace and mercy, for
the sake of my blessed Savior.The wet and uncomfortable weather staying us from
church this morning, our Doctor officiated in my family; at which were
present above twenty domestics.55, 56, of the vanity of this world and uncertainty of life, and
the inexpressible happiness and satisfaction of a holy life, with
pertinent inferences to prepare us for death and a future state.I gave
him thanks, and told him I took it kindly as my funeral sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26-7th November, 1703.The effects of the hurricane and tempest of
wind, rain, and lightning, through all the nation, especially London,
were very dismal.As to my
own losses, the subversion of woods and timber, both ornamental and
valuable, through my whole estate, and about my house the woods crowning
the garden mount, the growing along the park meadow, the damage to my
own dwelling, farms, and outhouses, is almost tragical, not to be
paralleled, with anything happening in our age.I am not able to
describe it; but submit to the pleasure of Almighty God.I removed to Dover Street, where I found all well;
but houses, trees, garden, etc., at Sayes Court, suffered very much.I made up my accounts, paid wages, gave rewards and
New Year's gifts, according to custom.The King of Spain[95] landing at Portsmouth, came to
Windsor, where he was magnificently entertained by the Queen, and
behaved himself so nobly, that everybody was taken with his graceful
deportment.After two days, having presented the great ladies, and
others, with valuable jewels, he went back to Portsmouth, and
immediately embarked for Spain.[Footnote 95: Charles III., afterward Emperor of Germany, by the
    title of Charles VI.]The Lord Treasurer gave my grandson the office of
Treasurer of the Stamp Duties, with a salary of L300 a year.The fast on the Martyrdom of King Charles I. was
observed with more than usual solemnity.Bathurst, President of Trinity College, Oxford, now
died,[96] I think the oldest acquaintance now left me in the world.He
was eighty-six years of age, stark blind, deaf, and memory lost, after
having been a person of admirable parts and learning.This is a serious
alarm to me.He built a very handsome
chapel to the college, and his own tomb.He gave a legacy of money, and
a third part of his library, to his nephew, Dr.Bohun, who went hence to
his funeral.[Footnote 96: There is a very good Life of him, with his portrait
    prefixed, by Thomas Warton, Fellow of Trinity College, and Poetry
    Professor at Oxford.][Sidenote: LONDON]

7th September, 1704.This day was celebrated the thanksgiving for the
late great victory,[97] with the utmost pomp and splendor by the Queen,
Court, great Officers, Lords Mayor, Sheriffs, Companies, etc.The
streets were scaffolded from Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor presented
her Majesty with a sword, which she returned.Every company was ranged
under its banners, the city militia without the rails, which were all
hung with cloth suitable to the color of the banner.The Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, and Aldermen were in their scarlet robes, with caparisoned
horses; the Knight Marshal on horseback; the Foot-Guards; the Queen in a
rich coach with eight horses, none with her but the Duchess of
Marlborough in a very plain garment, the Queen full of jewels.Music and
trumpets at every city company.The great officers of the Crown,
Nobility, and Bishops, all in coaches with six horses, besides
innumerable servants, went to St.After
this, the Queen went back in the same order to St.The city
companies feasted all the Nobility and Bishops, and illuminated at
night.Music for the church and anthems composed by the best masters.The day before was wet and stormy, but this was one of the most serene
and calm days that had been all the year.[Footnote 97: Over the French and Bavarians, at Blenheim, 13th
    August, 1704.]Being my birthday and the 84th year of my life,
after particular reflections on my concerns and passages of the year, I
set some considerable time of this day apart, to recollect and examine
my state and condition, giving God thanks, and acknowledging his
infinite mercies to me and mine, begging his blessing, and imploring his
protection for the year following.Lord Clarendon presented me with the three volumes of
his father's "History of the Rebellion."My Lord of Canterbury wrote to me for suffrage for Mr.Clarke's
continuance this year in the Boyle Lecture, which I willingly gave for
his excellent performance of this year.I went to wait on my Lord Treasurer, where was the
victorious Duke of Marlborough, who came to me and took me by the hand
with extraordinary familiarity and civility, as formerly he was used to
do, without any alteration of his good-nature.He had a most rich George
in a sardonyx set with diamonds of very great value; for the rest, very
plain.I had not seen him for some years, and believed he might have
forgotten me.Agues and smallpox much in
every place.Great loss by fire,
burning the outhouses and famous stable of the Earl of Nottingham, at
Burleigh [Rutlandshire], full of rich goods and furniture, by the
carelessness of a servant.A little before, the same happened at Lord
Pembroke's, at Wilton.The old Countess of Northumberland, Dowager of
Algernon Percy, Admiral of the fleet to King Charles I., died in the 83d
year of her age.She was sister to the Earl of Suffolk, and left a great
estate, her jointure to descend to the Duke of Somerset.On the death of the Emperor, there was no mourning worn at Court,
because there was none at the Imperial Court on the death of King
William.I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Turnham Green, the
gardens being very fine, and exceedingly well planted with fruit.Most extravagant expense to debauch and corrupt votes
for Parliament members.I sent my grandson with his party of my
freeholders to vote for Mr.I dined at Lambeth with the Archbishop of Dublin,
Dr.King, a sharp and ready man in politics, as well as very learned.We had long conversation about the philosopher's elixir,
which he believed attainable, and had seen projection himself by one who
went under the name of Mundanus, who sometimes came along among the
adepts, but was unknown as to his country, or abode; of this the doctor
had written a treatise in Latin, full of very astonishing relations.He
is a very learned person, formerly a Fellow of St.John's College,
Oxford, in which city he practiced physic, but has now altogether given
it over, and lives retired, being very old and infirm, yet continuing
chemistry.I went to Greenwich hospital, where they now began to take in wounded
and worn-out seamen, who are exceedingly well provided for.The
buildings now going on are very magnificent.[Sidenote: LONDON]

October, 1705.Observing how uncertain
great officers are of continuing long in their places, he would not
accept it, unless L2,000 a year were given him in reversion when he was
put out, in consideration of his loss of practice.His predecessors, how
little time soever they had the Seal, usually got L100,000 and made
themselves Barons.Lord Abington, Lieutenant
of the Tower, displaced, and General Churchill, brother to the Duke of
Marlborough, put in.An indication of great unsteadiness somewhere, but
thus the crafty Whig party (as called) begin to change the face of the
Court, in opposition to the High Churchmen, which was another
distinction of a party from the Low Churchmen.There had never been so great an assembly of members
on the first day of sitting, being more than 450.The votes both of the
old, as well as the new, fell to those called Low Churchmen, contrary to
all expectation.I am this day arrived to the 85th year of my age.Lord teach me so to number my days to come, that I may apply them to
wisdom!Making up my accounts for the past year, paid
bills, wages, and New Year's gifts, according to custom.Though much
indisposed and in so advanced a stage, I went to our chapel [in London]
to give God public thanks, beseeching Almighty God to assist me and my
family the ensuing year, if he should yet continue my pilgrimage here,
and bring me at last to a better life with him in his heavenly kingdom.Divers of our friends and relations dined with us this day.My indisposition increasing, I was exceedingly ill
this whole week.Notes of the sermons at the chapel in the morning and
afternoon, written with his own hand, conclude this Diary.[98]

Of course, upon a question like this, nothing can be absolutely known.We live on an atom called Earth, and what we know of the infinite is
almost infinitely limited; but, little as we know, all have an equal
right to give their honest thought.Life is a shadowy, strange,
and winding road on which we travel for a little way--a few short
steps--just from the cradle, with its lullaby of love, to the low and
quiet wayside inn, where all at last must sleep, and where the only
salutation is--Good-night.The Universe Self-Existent

The universe, according to my idea, is, always was, and forever will
be.It did not "come into being;" it is the one eternal being--the only
thing that ever did, does, or can exist.We know nothing of what we call the laws of Nature except as we gather
the idea of law from the uniformity of phenomena springing from like
conditions.To make myself clear: Water always runs down hill.The
theist says that this happens because there is behind the phenomenon an
active law.As a matter of fact law is this side of the phenomenon.Law
does not cause the phenomenon, but the phenomenon causes the idea of law
in our minds, and this idea is produced from the fact that under like
circumstances the same phenomena always happens.Black probably
thinks that the difference in the weight of rocks and clouds was created
by law; that parallel lines fail to imite only because it is illegal;
that diameter and circumference could have been so made that it would
be a greater distance across than around a circle, that a straight line
could inclose a triangle if not prevented by law, and that a little
legislation could make it possible for two bodies to occupy the same
space at the same time.It seems to me that law can not be the cause of
phenomena, but it is an effect produced in our minds by their succession
and resemblance.To put a God back of the universe compels us to admit
that there was a time when nothing existed except this God; that this
God had lived from eternity in an infinite vacuum and in an absolute
idleness.The mind of every thoughtful man is forced to one of these two
conclusions, either that the universe is self-existent or that it
was created by a self-existent being.To my mied there are far more
difficulties in the second hypothesis than in the first.Jehovah's Promise Broken

If Jehovah was in fact God, He knew the end from the beginning.He knew
that his Bible would be a breastwork behind which tyranny and hypocrisy
would crouch; that it would be quoted by tyrants; that it would be the
defense of robbers called kings and of hypocrites called priests.He
knew that He had taught the Jewish people but little of importance.He
knew that He found them free and left them captives.He knew that He
had never fulfilled the promises made to them.He knew that while other
nations had advanced in art and science his chosen people were savage
still.He promised them the world, and gave them a desert.He promised
them liberty, and He made them slaves.He promised them victory, and He
gave them defeat.He said they should be kings, and He made them
serfs.He promised them universal empire, and gave them exile.When one
finishes the Old Testament, he is compelled to say: Nothing can add to
the misery of a nation whose King is Jehovah!Character Bather than Creed

For a thousand years the torch of progress was extinguished in the blood
of Christ, and His disciples, moved by ignorant zeal, by insane, cruel
creeds, destroyed with flame and sword a hundred millions of their
fellow-men.But if cathedrals had been
universities--if dungeons of the Inquisition had been laboratories--if
Christians had believed in character instead of creed--if they had taken
from the Bible all the good and thrown away the wicked and absurd--if
domes of temples had been observatories--if priests had been
philosophers--if missionaries had taught the useful arts--if astrology
had been astronomy--if the black art had been chemistry--if superstition
had been science--if religion had been humanity--it would have been a
heaven filled with love, with liberty, and joy.Mohammed the Prophet of God

Mohammed was a poor man, a driver of camels.He was without education,
without influence, and without wealth, and yet in a few years he
consolidated thousands of tribes, and millions of men confess that there
is "one God, and Mohammed is his prophet."His success was a thousand
times greater during his life than that of Christ.He was not crucified;
he was a conqueror."Of all men, he exercised the greatest influence
upon the human race."Never in the world's history did a religion
spread with the rapidity of his.It burst like a storm over the fairest
portions of the globe.Black is right in his position that
rapidity is secured only by the direct aid of the Divine Being,
then Mohammed was most certainly the prophet of God.As to wars of
extermination and slavery, Mohammed agreed with Mr.Black, and upon
polygamy with Jehovah.As to religious toleration, he was great enough
to say that "men holding to any form of faith might be saved, provided
they were virtuous."In this he was far in advance both of Jehovah and
Mr.Wanted!--A Little More Legislation

We are informed by Mr.Black that "polygamy is neither commanded or
prohibited in the Old Testament--that it is only discouraged."It seems
to me that a little legislation on that subject might have tended to its
"discouragement."Black assures us "consists of certain immutable rules to govern the
conduct of all men at all times and at all places in their private and
personal relations with others," not one word is found on the subject of
polygamy.There is nothing "discouraging" in the Ten Commandments, nor
in the records of any conversation Jehovah is claimed to have had with
Moses upon Sinai.The life of Abraham, the story of Jacob and Laban,
the duty of a brother to be the husband of the widow of his deceased
brother, the life of David, taken in connection with the practice of
one who is claimed to have been the wisest of men--all these things are
probably relied on to show that polygamy was at least "discouraged."Certainly Jehovah had time to instruct Moses as to the infamy of
polygamy.He could have spared a few moments from a description of
patterns of tongs and basins for a subject so important as this.A
few-words in favor of the one wife and one husband--in favor of the
virtuous and loving home--might have taken the place of instructions
as to cutting the garments of priests and fashioning candlesticks and
ounces of gold.If he had left out simply the order that rams' skins
should be dyed red, and in its place had said, "A man shall have but one
wife, and the wife but one husband," how much better it would have been.Again, it is urged that "the acceptance of Christianity by a large
portion of the generation contemporary with its Founder and His
Apostles, was under the circumstances, an adjudication as solemn and
authoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."If this is true,
then "the acceptance of Buddhism by a large portion of the generation
contemporary with its Founder was an adjudication as solemn and
authoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."The same could
be said of Mohammedanism, and, in fact, of every religion that has
ever benefited or cursed this world.This argument, when reduced to its
simplest form, is this: All that succeeds is inspired.The Morality in Christianity

The morality in Christianity has never opposed the freedom of thought.It has never put, nor tended to put, a chain on a human mind, nor a
manacle on a human limb; but the doctrines distinctively Christian--the
necessity of believing a certain thing; the idea that eternal punishment
awaited him who failed to believe; the idea that the innocent can suffer
for the guilty--these things have |opposed, and for a thousand years
substantially destroyed the freedom of the human mind.All religions
have, with ceremony, magic, and mystery, deformed, darkened, and
corrupted, the soul.Around the sturdy oaks of morality have grown and
clung the parasitic, poisonous vines of the miraculous and monstrous.Irenaeus assures us that all Christians possessed the power of
working miracles; that they prophesied, cast out devils, healed the
sick, and even raised the dead.Epiphanius asserts that some rivers
and fountains were annually transmuted into wine, in attestation of the
miracle of Cana, adding that he himself had drunk of these fountains.Augustine declares that one was told in a dream where the bones of
St.Stephen were buried and the bones were thus discovered and brought
to Hippo, and that they raised five dead persons to life, and that in
two years seventy miracles were performed with these relics.Justin
Martyr states that God once sent some angels to guard the human race,
that these angels fell in love with the daughters of men, and became the
fathers of innumerable devils.For hundreds of years miracles were
about the only things that happened.They were wrought by thousands of
Christians, and testified to by millions.The saints and martyrs, the
best and greatest, were the witnesses and workers of wonders.Even
heretics, with the assistance of the devil, could suspend the "laws
of nature."Must we believe these wonderful accounts because they were
written by "good men," by Christians," who made their statements in the
presence and expectation of death"?The truth is that these "good men"
were mistaken.They fed their minds on prodigies, and their imaginations
feasted on effects without causes.Doubts were regarded as "rude disturbers of the congregation."Credulity
and sanctity walked hand in hand.As the philosophy of the ancients was rendered almost worthless by the
credulity of the common people, so the proverbs of Christ, his religion
of forgiveness, his creed of kindness, were lost in the mist of miracle
and the darkness of superstition.The Honor Due to Christ

For the man Christ--for the reformer who loved his fellow-men--for the
man who believed in an Infinite Father, who would shield the innocent
and protect the just--for the martyr who expected to be rescued from the
cruel cross, and who at last, finding that his rope was dust, cried out
in the gathering gloom of death; "My God!--for that great and suffering man, mistaken though he was, I have
the highest admiration and respect.That man did not, as I believe,
claim a miraculous origin; he did not pretend to heal the sick nor raise
the dead.He claimed simply to be a man, and taught his fellow-men
that love is stronger far than hate.His life was written by reverent
ignorance.Loving credulity belittled his career with feats of jugglery
and magic art, and priests wishing to persecute and slay, put in his
mouth the words of hatred and revenge.The theological Christ is the
impossible union of the human and divine--man with the attributes of
God, and God with the limitations and weakness of man.Christianity has no Monopoly in Morals

The morality of the world is not distinctively Christian.Zoroaster,
Gautama, Mohammed, Confucius, Christ, and, in fact, all founders of
religions, have said to their disciples: You must not steal; You must
not murder; You must not bear false witness; You must discharge your
obligations.Christianity is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the
miraculous origin of Jesus Christ, his crucifixion, his resurrection,
his ascension, the inspiration of the Bible, the doctrine of the
atonement, and the necessity of belief.Buddhism is the ordinary moral
code, _plus_ the miraculous illumination of Buddha, the performance of
certain ceremonies, a belief in the transmigration of the soul, and
in the final absorption of the human by the infinite.The religion of
Mohammed is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the belief that Mohammed
was the prophet of God, total abstinence from the use of intoxicating
drinks, a harem for the faithful here and hereafter, ablutions, prayers,
alms, pilgrimages, and fasts.Old Age in Superstition's Lap

And here I take occasion to thank Mr.Black for having admitted that
Jehovah gave no commandment against the practice of polygamy, that he
established slavery, waged wars of extermination, and persecuted for
opinions' sake even unto death, Most theologians endeavor to putty,
patch, and paint the wretched record of inspired crime, but Mr.Black
has been bold enough and honest enough to admit the truth.In this age
of fact and demonstration it is refreshing to find a man who believes
so thoroughly in the monstrous and miraculous, the impossible and
immoral--who still clings lovingly to the legends of the bib and
rattle--who through the bitter experiences of a wicked world has kept
the credulity of the cradle, and finds comfort and joy in thinking about
the Garden of Eden, the subtile serpent, the flood, and Babel's tower,
stopped by the jargon of a thousand tongues--who reads with happy eyes
the story of the burning brimstone storm that fell upon the cities
of the plain, and smilingly explains the transformation of the
retrospective Mrs.Lot--who laughs at Egypt's plagues and Pharaoh's
whelmed and drowning hosts--eats manna with the wandering Jews, warms
himself at the burning bush, sees Korah's company by the hungry earth
devoured, claps his wrinkled hands with glee above the heathens'
butchered babes, and longingly looks back to the patriarchal days of
concubines and slaves.How touching when the learned and wise crawl back
in cribs and ask to hear the rhymes and fables once again!How charming
in these hard and scientific times to see old age in Superstition's lap,
with eager lips upon her withered breast!Ararat in Chicago

A little while ago, in the city of Chicago, a gentleman addressed a
number of Sunday-school children.In his address he stated that some
people were wicked enough to deny the story of the deluge; that he was
a traveler; that he had been to the top of Mount Ararat, and had brought
with him a stone from that sacred locality.The children were then
invited to form in procession and walk by the pulpit, for the purpose of
seeing this wonderful stone.After they had looked at it, the lecturer
said: "Now, children, if you ever hear anybody deny the story of the
deluge, or say that the ark did not rest on Mount Ararat, you can tell
them that you know better, because you have seen with your own eyes a
stone from that very mountain."How Gods and Devils are Made

It was supposed that God demanded worship; that he loved to be
flattered; that he delighted in sacrifice; that nothing made him happier
than to see ignorant faith upon its knees; that above all things he
hated and despised doubters and heretics, and regarded investigation as
rebellion.Each community felt it a duty to see that the enemies of God
were converted or killed.To allow a heretic to live in peace was
to invite the wrath of God.Every public evil--every misfortune--was
accounted for by something the community had permitted or done.When
epidemics appeared, brought by ignorance and welcomed by filth, the
heretic was brought out and sacrificed to appease the anger of God.By putting intention behind what man called good, God was produced.By
putting intention behind what man called bad, the Devil was created.Leave this "intention" out, and gods and devils fade away.If not a
human being existed, the sun would continue to shine, and tempest now
and then would devastate the earth; the rain would fall in pleasant
showers; violets would spread their velvet bosoms to the sun, the
earthquake would devour, birds would sing, and daisies bloom, and
roses blush, and volcanoes fill the heavens with their lurid glare; the
procession of the seasons would not be broken, and the stars would shine
as serenely as though the world were filled with loving hearts and happy
homes.The Romance of Figures

How long, according to the universal benevolence of the New Testament,
can a man be reasonably punished in the next world for failing to
believe something unreasonable in this?Can it be possible that any
punishment can endure forever?Suppose that every flake of snow that
ever fell was a figure nine, and that the first flake was multiplied by
the second, and that product by the third, and so on to the last flake.And then suppose that this total should be multiplied by every drop of
rain that ever fell, calling each drop a figure nine; and that total by
each blade of grass that ever helped to weave a carpet for the earth,
calling each blade a figure nine; and that again by every grain of sand
on every shore, so that the grand total would make a line of nines so
long that it would require millions upon millions of years for light,
traveling at the rate of one hundred and eighty-five thousand miles per
second, to reach the end.And suppose, further, that each unit in this
almost infinite total, stood for billions of ages--still that vast and
almost endless time, measured by all the years beyond, is as one flake,
one drop, one leaf, one blade, one grain, compared with all the flakes,
and drops, and leaves, and blades and grains.Upon love's breast the
Church has placed the eternal asp.And yet, in the same book in which is
taught this most infamous of doctrines, we are assured that "The Lord is
good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works."God and Zeno

If the Bible is inspired, Jehovah, God of all worlds, actually said:
"And if a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod, and he die under
his hand, he shall be surely punished; notwithstanding, if he continue
a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his money."And yet
Zeno, founder of the Stoics, centuries before Christ was born, insisted
that no man could be the owner of another, and that the title was bad,
whether the slave had become so by conquest, or by purchase.Jehovah,
ordered a Jewish general to make war, and gave, among others, this
command: "When the Lord thy God shall drive them before thee, thou shalt
smite them and utterly destroy them."And yet Epictetus, whom we have
already quoted, gave this marvelous rule for the guidance of human
conduct: "Live with thy inferiors as thou wouldst have thy superiors
live with thee."If Christ was in fact God, he knew all the future.Before him, like a
panorama, moved the history yet to be.He knew exactly how his words
would be interpreted.He knew what crimes, what horrors, what infamies,
would be committed in his name.He knew that the fires of persecution
would climb around the limbs of countless martyrs.He knew that brave
men would languish in dungeons, in darkness, filled with pain; that the
church would use instruments of torture, that his followers would appeal
to whip and chain.He must have seen the horizon of the future red with
the flames of the _auto da fe_.He knew all the creeds that would spring
like poison fungi from every text.He saw the sects waging war against
each other.He saw thousands of men, under the orders of priests,
building dungeons for their fellow-men.He heard the groans, saw the faces white with agony, the tears,
the blood--heard the shrieks and sobs of all the moaning, martyred
multitudes.He knew that commentaries would be written on his words with
swords, to be read by the light of fagots.He knew that the Inquisition
would be born of teachings attributed to him.He saw all the
interpolations and falsehoods that hypocrisy would write and tell.He
knew that above these fields of death, these dungeons, these burnings,
for a thousand years would float the dripping banner of the cross.He
knew that in his name his followers would trade in human flesh, that
cradles would be robbed and women's breasts unbabed for gold;--and yet
he died with voiceless lips.Why did he not
tell his disciples, and through them the world, that man should not
persecute, for opinion's sake, his fellow-man?Why did he not cry, You
shall not persecute in my name; you shall not burn and torment those who
differ from you in creed?Why did he not plainly say, I am the Son of
God?Why did he not explain the doctrine of the trinity?Why did he not
tell the manner of baptism that was pleasing to him?Why did he not say
something positive, definite, and satisfactory about another world?Why
did he not turn the tear-stained hope of heaven to the glad knowledge
of another life?Why did he go dumbly to his death, leaving the world to
misery and to doubt?The Philosophy of Action

Consequences determine the quality of an action.If consequences are
good, so is the action.If actions had no consequences, they would be
neither good nor bad.Man did not get his knowledge of the consequences
of actions from God, but from experience and reason.If man can, by
actual experiment, discover the right and wrong of actions, is it not
utterly illogical to declare that they who do not believe in God can
have no standard of right and wrong?Consequences are the standard by
which actions are judged.They are the children that testify as to the
real character of their parents.God or no God, larceny is the enemy of
industry--industry is the mother of prosperity--prosperity is a good,
and therefore larceny is an evil.God or no God, murder is a crime.There has always been a law against larceny, because the laborer wishes
to enjoy the fruit of his toil.As long as men object to being killed,
murder will be illegal.I have insisted, and I still insist, that it is still impossible for
a finite man to commit a crime deserving infinite punishment; and upon
this subject Mr.Black admits that "no revelation has lifted the veil
between time and eternity;" and, consequently, neither the priest nor
the "policeman" knows anything with certainty regarding another world.He simply insists that "in shadowy figures we are warned that a very
marked distinction will be made between the good and bad in the next
world."There is "a very marked distinction" in this; but there is this
rainbow in the darkest human cloud: The worst have hope of reform.All I
insist is, if there is another life, the basest soul that finds its way
to that dark or radiant shore will have the everlasting chance of
doing right.Nothing but the most cruel ignorance, the most heartless
superstition, the most ignorant theology, ever imagined that the
few days of human life spent here, surrounded by mists and clouds of
darkness, blown over life's sea by storms and tempests of passion, fixed
for all eternity the condition of the human race.If this doctrine be
true, this life is but a net, in which Jehovah catches souls for hell.We are told that "there is no good reason to doubt that the statements
of the Evangelists, as we have them now, are genuine."The fact is, no
one knows who made the "statements of the Evangelists."There are three
important manuscripts upon which the Christian world relies."The first
appeared in the catalogue of the Vatican, in 1475.Of the New, it contains the four gospels,--the Acts, the
seven Catholic Epistles, nine of the Pauline Epistles, and the
Epistle to the Hebrews, so far as the fourteenth verse of the ninth
chapter,"--and nothing more."The
second, the Alexandrine, was presented to King Charles the First, in
1628.It contains the Old and New Testaments, with some exceptions;
passages are wanting in Matthew, in John, and in II.It
also contains the Epistle of Clemens Romanus, a letter of Athanasius,
and the treatise of Eusebius on the Psalms."The last is the Sinaitic
Codex, discovered about 1850, at the Convent of St."It contains the Old and New Testaments, and in addition
the entire Epistle of Barnabas, and a portion of the Shepherd of
Hennas--two books which, up to the beginning of the fourth century, were
looked upon by many as Scripture."In this manuscript, or codex, the
gospel of St.Mark concludes with the eighth verse of the sixteenth
chapter, leaving out the frightful passage: "Go ye into all the world,
and preach the gospel to every creature.He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned."In
matters of the utmost importance these manuscripts disagree, but even if
they all agreed it would not furnish the slightest evidence of their
truth.It will not do to call the statements made in the gospels
"depositions," until it is absolutely established who made them, and the
circumstances under which they were made.Neither can we say that "they
were made in the immediate prospect of death," until we know who made
them.It is absurd to say that "the witnesses could not have been
mistaken, because the nature of the facts precluded the possibility of
any delusion about them."Can it be pretended that the witnesses could
not have been mistaken about the relation the Holy Ghost is alleged to
have sustained to Jesus Christ?Is there no possibility of delusion
about a circumstance of that kind?Did the writers of the four gospels
have "the sensible and true avouch of their own eyes and ears" in that
behalf?How was it possible for any one of the four Evangelists to know
that Christ was the Son of God, or that he was God?Matthew says that an angel of the Lord told
Joseph in a dream, but Joseph never wrote an account of this wonderful
vision.Luke tells us that the angel had a conversation with Mary, and
that Mary told Elizabeth, but Elizabeth never wrote a word.There is no
account of Mary, or Joseph, or Elizabeth, or the angel, having had any
conversation with Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, in which one word was
said about the miraculous origin of Jesus Christ.The persons who knew
did not write, so that the account is nothing but hearsay.Black pretend that such statements would be admitted as evidence in any
court?But how do we know that the disciples of Christ wrote a word of
the gospels?How do we know
that the writers of the gospels "were men of unimpeachable character?"Black's Admission

For the purpose of defending the character of his infallible God, Mr.Black is forced to defend religious intolerance, wars of extermination,
human slavery, and almost polygamy.He admits that God established
slavery; that he commanded his chosen people to buy the children of the
heathen; that heathen fathers and mothers did right to sell their girls
and boys; that God ordered the Jews to wage wars of extermination and
conquest; that it was right to kill the old and young; that God forged
manacles for the human brain; that he commanded husbands to murder their
wives for suggesting the worship of the sun or moon; and that every
cruel, savage passage in the Old Testament was inspired by him.Such is
a "policeman's" view of God.The Stars Upon the Door of France

Mr.Black justifies all the crimes and horrors, excuses all the tortures
of all the Christian years, by denouncing the cruelties of the French
Revolution.Thinking people will not hasten to admit that an infinitely
good being authorized slavery in Judea, because of the atrocities of the
French Revolution.They will remember the sufferings of the Huguenots.They will not forget
the countless cruelties of priest and king.They will not forget the
dungeons of the Bastile.They will know that the Revolution was an
effect, and that liberty was not the cause--that atheism was not the
cause.Behind the Revolution they will see altar and throne--sword and
fagot--palace and cathedral--king and priest--master and slave--tyrant
and hypocrite.They will see that the excesses, the cruelties, and
crimes were but the natural fruit of seeds the church had sown.Upon that cloud of war, black with
the myriad miseries of a thousand years, dabbled with blood of king and
queen, of patriot and priest, there was this bow: "Beneath the flag of
France all men are free."In spite of all the blood and crime, in spite
of deeds that seem insanely base, the People placed upon a Nation's brow
these stars:--Liberty, Fraternity, Equality--grander words than ever
issued from Jehovah's lips.A KIND WORD FOR JOHN CHINAMAN

On the 27th day of March, 1880, Messrs.Wright, Dickey, O'Conner, and
Murch, of the Select Committee appointed by Congress to "Consider
the causes of the present depression of labor," presented the majority
special report on Chinese Immigration.The following quotations are
excerpts from Col.R. G. Ingersoll's caustic review of that report.The Select Committee Afraid

These gentlemen are in great fear for the future of our most holy and
perfectly authenticated religion, and have, like faithful watchmen,
from the walls and towers of Zion, hastened to give the alarm.They have
informed Congress that "Joss has his temple of worship in the Chinese
quarters, in San Francisco.Within the walls of a dilapidated structure
is exposed to the view of the faithful the God of the Chinaman, and here
are his altars of worship, Here he tears up his pieces of paper; here he
offers up his prayers; here he receives his religious consolations,
and here is his road to the celestial land."That "Joss is located in a
long, narrow room, in a building in a back alley, upon a kind of altar;"
that "he is a wooden image, looking as much like an alligator as like a
human being;" that the Chinese "think there is such a place as heaven;"
that "all classes of Chinamen worship idols;" that "the temple is open
every day at all hours;" that "the Chinese have no Sunday;" that this
heathen god has "huge jaws, a big red tongue, large white teeth, a half
dozen arms, and big, fiery, eyeballs.About him are placed offerings of
meat, and other eatables--a sacrificial offering."The Gods of the Joss-House and Patmos

No wonder that these members of the committee were shocked at such a
god, knowing as they did, that the only true God was correctly described
by the inspired lunatic of Patmos in the following words: "And there sat
in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the Son of
Man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps
with a golden girdle.His head and his hairs were white like wool, as
white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; and his feet like
unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the
sound of many waters.And he had in his right hand seven stars; and out
of his mouth went a sharp, two-edged sword; and his countenance was as
the sun shining in his strength."Certainly, a large mouth, filled
with white teeth, is preferable to one used as the scabbard of a sharp,
two-edged sword.Why should these gentlemen object to a god with big
fiery eyeballs, when their own Deity has eyes like a flame of fire?A Little Too Late

Is it not a little late in the day to object to people because they
sacrifice meat and other eatables to their god?We all know, that for
thousands of years the "real" God was exceedingly fond of roasted meat;
that He loved the savor of burning flesh, and delighted in the perfume
of fresh warm blood.Christianity has a Fair Show in San Francisco

The world is also informed by these gentlemen that "the idolatry of
the Chinese produces a demoralizing effect upon our American youth by
bringing sacred things into disrespect and making religion a theme of
disgust and contempt."In San Francisco there are some three hundred
thousand people.Is it possible that a few Chinese can bring "our holy
religion" into disgust and contempt?In that city there are fifty times
as many churches as joss-houses.Scores of sermons are uttered every
week; religious books and papers are plentiful as leaves in autumn, and
somewhat dryer; thousands of bibles are within the reach of all.An Arrow from the Quiver of Satire

And there, too, is the example of a Christian city.Why should we send
missionaries to China, if we cannot convert the heathen when they come
here?When missionaries go to a foreign land the poor benighted people
have to take their word for the blessings showered upon a Christian
people; but when the heathen come here, they can see for themselves.What was simply a story becomes a demonstrated fact.They come in
contact with people who love their enemies.They see that in a Christian
land men tell the truth; that they will not take advantage of strangers;
that they are just and patient; kind and tender; and have no prejudice
on account of color, race or religion; that they look upon mankind as
brethren; that they speak of God as a Universal Father, and are
willing to work and even to suffer, for the good, not only of their own
countrymen, but of the heathen as well.All this the Chinese see and
know, and why they still cling to the religion of their country is, to
me, a matter of amazement.We Have no Religious System

I take this, the earliest opportunity, to inform these gentlemen
composing a majority of the committee, that we have in the United States
no "religious system;" that this is a secular government.That it has
no religious creed; that it does not believe nor disbelieve in a future
state of reward or punishment; that it neither affirms nor denies the
existence of a "living" God.Congress Nothing to Do with Religion

Congress has nothing to do with the religion of the people.Its members
are not responsible to God for the opinions of their constituents, and
it may tend to the happiness of the constituents for me to state that
they are in no way responsible for the religion of the members.Religion
is an individual, not a national matter.And where the nation interferes
with the right of conscience, the liberties of the people are devoured
by the monster Superstition.But I am astonished that four Christian statesmen, four members of
Congress in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, who seriously
object to people on account of their religious convictions, should
still assert that the very religion in which they believe--and the only
religion established by the living god-head of the American system--is
not adapted to the spiritual needs of one-third of the human race.It is
amazing that these four gentlemen have, in the defense of the Christian
religion, announced the discovery that it is wholly inadequate for
the civilization of mankind; that the light of the cross can never
penetrate the darkness of China; "that all the labors of the missionary,
the example of the good, the exalted character of our civilization, make
no impression upon the pagan life of the Chinese;" and that even
the report of this committee will not tend to elevate, refine and
Christianize the yellow heathen of the Pacific coast.In the name
of religion these gentlemen have denied its power and mocked at the
enthusiasm of its founder.Worse than this, they have predicted for the
Chinese a future of ignorance and idolatry in this world, and, if the
"American system" of religion is true, hell-fire in the next.Do not Trample on John Chinaman

Do not trample upon these people because they have a different
conception of things about which even this committee knows nothing.Give them the same privilege you enjoy of making a God after their own
fashion.Would you be willing
to have them remain, if one of their race, thousands of years ago, had
pretended to have seen God, and had written of him as follows: "There
went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth; coals
were kindled by it, * * * and he rode upon a cherub and did fly."Why
should you object to these people on account of their religion?Your
objection has in it the spirit of hate and intolerance.That spirit lighted the fagot, made the
thumb-screw, put chains upon the limbs, and lashes upon the backs of
men.The same spirit bought and sold, captured and kidnapped human
beings; sold babes, and justified all the horrors of slavery.Be Honest with the Chinese

If you wish to drive out the Chinese, do not make a pretext of religion.Do not pretend that you are trying to do God a favor.Injustice in his
name is doubly detestable.The assassin cannot sanctify his dagger by
falling on his knees, and it does not help a falsehood if it be uttered
as a prayer.Religion, used, to intensify the hatred of men toward men,
under the pretense of pleasing God, has cursed this world.An Honest Merchant the Best Missionary

I am almost sure that I have read somewhere that "Christ died for _all_
men," and that "God is no respecter of persons."It was once taught
that it was the duty of Christians to tell to all people the "tidings of
great joy."I have never believed these things myself, but have always
contended that an honest merchant was the best missionary.Commerce
makes friends, religion makes enemies; the one enriches, and the other
impoverishes; the one thrives best where the truth is told, the other
where falsehoods are believed.For myself, I have but little confidence
in any business, or enterprise, or investment, that promises dividends
only after the death of the stockholders.Good Words from Confucius

For the benefit of these four philosophers and prophets, I will give a
few extracts from the writings of Confucius that will, in my judgment,
compare favorably with the best passages of their report:

"My doctrine is that man must be true to the principles of his nature,
and the benevolent exercises of them toward others.""With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and with my bended arm
for a pillow, I still have joy.""Riches and honor acquired by injustice are to me but floating clouds.""The man who, in view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who, in view of
danger, forgets life; and who remembers an old agreement, however far
back it extends, such a man may be reckoned a complete man.""Recompense injury with justice, and kindness with kindness."There is one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's
life: Reciprocity is that word.The Ancient Chinese

When the ancestors of the four Christian Congressmen were barbarians,
when they lived in caves, gnawed bones, and worshiped dry snakes; the
infamous Chinese were reading these sublime sentences of Confucius.When
the forefathers of these Christian statesmen were hunting toads to
get the jewels out of their heads to be used as charms, the wretched
Chinamen were calculating eclipses, and measuring the circumference
of the earth.When the progenitors of these representatives of the
"American system of religion" were burning women charged with nursing
devils, these people "incapable of being influenced by the exalted
character of our civilization," were building asylums for the insane.The Chinese and Civil Service Reform

Neither should it be forgotten that, for thousands of years, the Chinese
have honestly practised the great principle known as civil service
reform--a something that even the administration of Mr.Hayes has
reached only through the proxy of promise.Invading China in the Name of Opium and Christ

The English battered down the door of China in the names of Opium and
Christ.This infamy was regarded as another triumph of the gospel.At last in self-defense the Chinese allowed Christians to touch their
shores.Their wise men, their philosophers, protested, and prophesied
that time would show that Christians could not be trusted.This re port
proves that the wise men were not only philosophers but prophets.Don't be Dishonest in the Name of God

Treat China as you would England.Change it if you will, according to the laws of nations, but on no
account excuse a breach of national faith by pretending that we are
dishonest for God's sake.CONCERNING CREEDS AND THE TYRANNY OF SECTS




482.Diversity of Opinion Abolished by Henry VIII

In the reign of Henry VIII--that pious and moral founder of the
apostolic Episcopal Church,--there was passed by the parliament
of England an act entitled, "An act for abolishing of diversity of
opinion."And in this act was set forth what a good Christian was
obliged to believe:

First, That in the sacrament was the real body and blood of Jesus
Christ.Second, That the body and blood of Jesus Christ was in the bread, and
the blood and body of Jesus Christ was in the wine.Fourth, That vows of chastity were of perpetual obligation.Fifth, That private masses ought to be continued; and,

Sixth, That auricular confession to a priest must be maintained.This creed was made by law, in order that all men might know just what
to believe by simply reading the statute.The Church hated to see the
people wearing out their brains in thinking upon these subjects.Spencer and Darwin Damned

According to the philosophy of theology, man has continued to degenerate
for six thousand years.To teach that there is that in nature which
impels to higher forms and grander ends, is heresy, of course.The
Deity will damn Spencer and his "Evolution," Darwin and his "Origin
of Species," Bastian and his "Spontaneous Generation," Huxley and his
"Protoplasm," Tyndall and his "Prayer Gauge," and will save those, and
those only, who declare that the universe has been cursed, from the
smallest atom to the grandest star; that everything tends to evil and to
that only, and that the only perfect thing in nature is the Presbyterian
Confession of Faith.The Dead do Not Persecute

Imagine a vine that grows at one end and decays at the other.The
end that grows is heresy, the end that rots is orthodox.The dead are
orthodox, and your cemetery is the most perfect type of a well regulated
church.No thought, no progress, no heresy there.Slowly and silently,
side by side, the satisfied members peacefully decay.There is only this
difference--the dead do not persecute.The Atheist a Legal Outcast in Illinois

The supreme court of Illinois decided, in the year of grace 1856, that
an unbeliever in the existence of an intelligent First Cause could not
be allowed to testify in any court.His wife and children might have
been murdered before his very face, and yet in the absence of other
witnesses, the murderer could not have even been indicted.To him, Justice was not only blind, but deaf.He
was liable, like other men, to support the government, and was forced to
contribute his share towards paying the salaries of the very judges
who decided that under no circumstances could his voice be heard in any
court.This was the law of Illinois, and so remained until the adoption
of the new Constitution By such infamous means has the Church endeavored
to chain the human mind, and protect the majesty of her God.How the Owls Hoot

Now and then somebody examines, and in spite of all keeps his manhood,
and has the courage to follow where his reason leads.Then the pious
get together and repeat wise saws, and exchange knowing nods and most
prophetic winks.The stupidly wise sit owl-like on the dead limbs of the
tree of knowledge, and solemnly hoot.The Fate of Theological Students

Thousands of young men are being educated at this moment by the various
Churches.In order that they may be prepared to investigate
the phenomena by which we are surrounded?The object, and the only
object, is that they may be prepared to defend a creed; that they may
learn the arguments of their respective churches, and repeat them in
the dull ears of a thoughtless congregation.If one, after being thus
trained at the expense of the Methodists, turns Presbyterian or Baptist,
he is denounced as an ungrateful wretch.Honest investigation is utterly
impossible within the pale of any Church, for the reason, that if you
think the Church is right you will not investigate, and if you think it
wrong, the Church will investigate you.The consequence of this is,
that most of the theological literature is the result of suppression, of
fear, tyranny and hypocrisy.Trials for Heresy

A trial for heresy means that the spirit of persecution still lingers in
the Church; that it still denies the right of private judgment; that it
still thinks more of creed than truth, and that it is still determined
to prevent the intellectual growth of man.It means the churches are
shambles in which are bought and sold the souls of men.It means that
the Church is still guilty of the barbarity of opposing thought with
force.It means that if it had the power, the mental horizon would be
bound by a creed; that it would bring again the whips and chains and
dungeon keys, the rack and fagot of the past.Presbyterianism Softening

Fortunately for us, civilization has had a softening effect even upon
the Presbyterian Church.To the ennobling influence of the arts and
sciences the savage spirit of Calvinism has, in some slight degree,
succumbed.True, the old creed remains substantially as it was written,
but by a kind of tacit understanding it has come to be regarded as a
relic of the past.The cry of "heresy" has been growing fainter and
fainter, and, as a consequence, the ministers of that denomination
have ventured, now and then, to express doubts as to the damnation of
infants, and the doctrine of total depravity.The Methodist "Hoist with his own Petard."A few years ago a Methodist clergyman took it upon himself to give me a
piece of friendly advice."Although you may disbelieve the bible," said
he, "you ought not to say so."Do
you believe the bible," said I. He replied, "Most assuredly."To which
I retorted, "Your answer conveys no information to me.You may be
following your own advice.Of
course a man who will advise others to dissimulate will not always be
particular about telling the truth himself."The Precious Doctrine of Total Depravity

What a precious doctrine is that of the total depravity of the human
heart!How sweet it is to believe that the lives of all the good and
great were continual sins and perpetual crimes; that the love a mother
bears her child is, in the sight of God, a sin; that the gratitude of
the natural heart is simple meanness; that the tears of pity are impure;
that for the unconverted to live and labor for others is an offense to
heaven; that the noblest aspirations of the soul are low and groveling
in the sight of God.Guilty of Heresy

Whoever has an opinion of his own, and honestly expresses it, will be
guilty of heresy.Heresy is what the minority believe; it is the name
given by the powerful to the doctrine of the weak.This word was born of
the hatred, arrogance and cruelty of those who love their enemies, and
who, when smitten on one cheek, turn the other.This word was born of
intellectual slavery in the feudal ages of thought.It was an epithet
used in the place of argument.From the commencement of the Christian
era, every art has been exhausted and every conceivable punishment
inflicted to force all people to hold the same religious opinions.This
effort was born of the idea that a certain belief was necessary to the
salvation of the soul.One great trouble is that most teachers are dishonest.They teach as
certainties those things concerning which they entertain doubts.They
do not say, "we _think_ this is so," but "we _know_ this is so."They do
not appeal to the reason of the pupil, but they command his faith.They
keep all doubts to themselves; they do not explain, they assert.In all ages reason has been regarded as the enemy of religion.Nothing
has been considered so pleasing to the Deity as a total denial of the
authority of your own mind.Self-reliance has been thought a deadly
sin; and the idea of living and dying without the aid and consolation
of superstition has always horrified the Church.By some unaccountable
infatuation, belief has been and still is considered of immense
importance.All religions have been based upon the idea that God will
forever reward the true believer, and eternally damn the man who doubts
or denies.Belief is regarded as the one essential thing.To practice
justice, to love mercy, is not enough.You must believe in some
incomprehensible creed.You must say, "Once one is three, and three
times one is one."The man who practiced every virtue, but failed to
believe, was execrated.Nothing so outrages the feelings of the Church
as a moral unbeliever--nothing so horrible as a charitable Atheist.A Hundred and Fifty Years Ago

One hundred and fifty years ago the foremost preachers would have
perished at the stake.A Universalist would have been torn in pieces in
England, Scotland, and America.Unitarians would have found themselves
in the stocks, pelted by the rabble with dead cats, after which their
ears would have been cut off, their tongues bored, and their foreheads
branded.The Despotism of Faith

The despotism of faith is justified upon the ground that Christian
countries are the grandest and most prosperous of the world.At one time
the same thing could have been truly said in India, in Egypt, in Greece,
in Rome, and in every other country that has, in the history of the
world, swept to empire.This argument proves too much not only, but the
assumption upon which it is based is utterly false.Believe, or Beware

And what does a trial for heresy mean?It means that the Church says
a heretic, "Believe as I do, or I will withdraw my support.I will pursue you until your garments are rags; until your
children cry for bread; until your cheeks are furrowed with tears.I
will hunt you to the very portals of the grave."Calvin's Petrified Heart

Luther denounced mental liberty with all the coarse and brutal vigor
of his nature; Calvin despised, from the very bottom of his petrified
heart, anything that even looked like religious toleration, and solemnly
declared that to advocate it was to crucify Christ afresh.All the
founders of all the orthodox churches have advocated the same infamous
tenet.The truth is, that what is called religion is necessarily
inconsistent with free thought.Must one be versed in Latin before he is entitled to express his opinion
as to the genuineness of a pretended revelation from God?Common sense
belongs exclusively to no tongue.Logic is not confined to, nor has it
been buried with, the dead languages.Paine attacked the bible as it is
translated.If the translation is wrong, let its defenders correct it.A gentleman, walking among the ruins of Athens came upon a fallen statue
of Jupiter; making an exceedingly low bow he said: "O Jupiter!He then added: "Should you ever sit upon the throne of heaven
again, do not, I pray you, forget that I treated you politely when you
were prostrate."The Tail of a Lion

There is no saying more degrading than this: "It is better to be the
tail of a lion than the head of a dog."It is a responsibility to think
and act for yourself.Most people hate responsibility; therefore they
join something and become the tail of some lion.They say, "My party
can act for me--my church can do my thinking.It is enough for me to
pay taxes and obey the lion to which I belong, without troubling myself
about the right, the wrong, or the why or the wherefore."While the Preachers Talked the People Slept

The fact is, the old ideas became a little monotonous to the people.The
fall of man, the scheme of redemption and irresistible grace, began
to have a familiar sound.The preachers told the old stories while the
congregations slept.Some of the ministers became tired of these stories
themselves.The five points grew dull, and they felt that nothing short
of irresistible grace could bear this endless repetition.The outside
world was full of progress, and in every direction men advanced, while
the church, anchored to a creed, idly rotted at the shore.Christianity no Friend to Progress

Christianity has always opposed every forward movement of the human
race.Across the highway of progress it has always been building
breastworks of bibles, tracts, commentaries, prayer-books, creeds,
dogmas and platforms, and at every advance the Christians have gathered
together behind these heaps of rubbish and shot the poisoned arrows of
malice at the soldiers of freedom.You may be laughed at in this world for insisting that God put Adam into
a deep sleep and made a woman out of one of his ribs, but you will be
crowned and glorified in the next.You will also have the pleasure of
hearing the gentlemen howl there, who laughed at you here.While you
will not be permitted to take any revenge, you will be allowed to
smilingly express your entire acquiescence in the will of God.The one was lost, and the other has not
been found.The Real Eden is Beyond

Nations and individuals fail and die, and make room for higher forms.The intellectual horizon of the world widens as the centuries pass.Ideals grow grander and purer; the difference between justice and mercy
becomes less and less; liberty enlarges, and love intensifies as the
years sweep on.The ages of force and fear, of cruelty and wrong, are
behind us and the real Eden is beyond.It is said that a desire for
knowledge lost us the Eden of the past; but whether that is true or not,
it will certainly give us the Eden of the future.Party Names Belittle Men

Let us forget that we are Baptists, Methodists, Catholics,
Presbyterians, or Free-thinkers, and remember only that we are men and
women.After all, man and woman are the highest possible titles.All
other names belittle us, and show that we have, to a certain extent,
given up our individuality.A FEW PLAIN QUESTIONS




507.On which of the six days was he
created?Is it possible that God would make a successful
rival?He must have known that Adam and Eve would fall.He knew what
a snake with a "spotted, dappled skin" could do with an inexperienced
woman.He knew that if the serpent
got into the garden, Adam and Eve would sin, that he would have to drive
them out, that afterwards the world would be destroyed, and that he
himself would die upon the cross.Must We Believe Fables to be Good and True?Must we, in order to be
good, gentle and loving in our lives, believe that the creation of woman
was a second thought?That Jehovah really endeavored to induce Adam to
take one of the lower animals as an helpmeet for him?After all, is it
not possible to live honest and courageous lives without believing these
fables?Why was not the serpent kept out of the garden?Why did not the Lord God
take him by the tail and snap his head off?Why did he not put Adam
and Eve on their guard about this serpent?They, of course, were not
acquainted in the neighborhood, and knew nothing about the serpent's
reputation.Questions About the Ark

How was the ark kept clean?We know how it was ventilated; but what
was done with the filth?How were some
portions of the ark heated for animals from the tropics, and others
kept cool for the polar bears?How did the animals get back to their
respective countries?Some had to creep back about six thousand miles,
and they could only go a few feet a day.Some of the creeping things
must have started for the ark just as soon as they were made, and kept
up a steady jog for sixteen hundred years.Think of a couple of the
slowest snails leaving a point opposite the ark and starting for the
plains of Shinar, a distance of twelve thousand miles.Going at the rate
rate of a mile a month, it would take them a thousand years.Polar bears must have gone several thousand miles, and
so sudden a change in climate must have been exceedingly trying upon
their health.Of course, all the polar
bears did not go.It could be confounded only by the
destruction of memory.Did God destroy the memory of mankind at
that time, and if so, how?Did he paralyze that portion of the brain
presiding over the organs of articulation, so that they could not speak
the words, although they remembered them clearly, or did he so touch
the brain that they could not hear?Will some theologian, versed in
the machinery of the miraculous, tell us in what way God confounded the
language of mankind?Would God Kill a Man for Making Ointment?Can we believe that the real God, if there is one, ever ordered a man
to be killed simply for making hair oil, or ointment?We are told in
the thirtieth chapter of Exodus, that the Lord commanded Moses to take
myrrh, cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia, and olive oil, and make a
holy ointment for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle, tables,
candlesticks and other utensils, as well as Aaron and his sons; saying,
at the same time, that whosoever compounded any like it, or whoever put
any of it on a stranger, should be put to death.In the same chapter,
the Lord furnishes Moses with a recipe for making a perfume, saying,
that whoever should make any which smelled like it, should be cut off
from his people.This, to me, sounds so unreasonable that I cannot
believe it.Some Christians say that the fountains of the great deep were broken up.Will they be kind enough to tell us what the fountains of the great deep
are?Others say that God had vast stores of water in the center of the
earth that he used on the occasion of the flood.How did these waters
happen to run up hill?Would a Real God Uphold Slavery?Must we believe that God called some of his children the money of
others?Can we believe that God made lashes upon the naked back, a
legal tender for labor performed?Must we regard the auction block as an
altar?Were the
stealers and whippers of babes and women the justified children of God?Will some minister, who now believes in religious liberty, and
eloquently denounces the intolerance of Catholicism, explain these
things; will he tell us why he worships an intolerant God?Is a god who
will burn a soul forever in another world, better than a christian who
burns the body for a few hours in this?Do the angels all discuss questions on the same side?Are all the
investigators in perdition?Will the penitent thief, winged and crowned,
laugh at the honest folks in hell?Will the agony of the damned increase
or decrease the happiness of God?Will there be, in the universe, an
eternal _auto da fe_?Why should a believer in God hate an atheist?Surely the atheist has
not injured God, and surely he is human, capable of joy and pain, and
entitled to all the rights of man.Would it not be far better to treat
this atheist, at least, as well as he treats us?ORIENT PEARLS AS RANDOM STRUNG

I do not believe that Christians are as bad as their creeds.The highest crime against a creed is to change it.A believer is a bird in a cage, a free-thinker is an eagle parting the
clouds with tireless wing.All that is good in our civilization is the result of commerce, climate,
soil, geographical position.The heretics have not thought and suffered and died in vain.Every
heretic has been, and is, a ray of light.No man ever seriously attempted to reform a Church without being cast
out and hunted down by the hounds of hypocrisy.After all, the poorest bargain that a human being can make, is to give
his individuality for what is called respectability.On every hand are the enemies of individuality and mental freedom.Custom meets us at the cradle and leaves us only at the tomb.There can be nothing more utterly subversive of all that is really
valuable than the suppression of honest thought.No man, worthy of the form he bears, will at the command of Church or
State solemnly repeat a creed his reason scorns.Although we live in what is called a free government,--and politically
we are free,--there is but little religious liberty in America.According to orthodox logic, God having furnished us with imperfect
minds, has a right to demand a perfect result.Nearly all people stand in great horror of annihilation, and yet to give
up your individuality is to annihilate yourself.When women reason, and babes sit in the lap of philosophy, the victory
of reason over the shadowy host of darkness will be complete.Of all the religions that have been produced by the egotism, the malice,
the ignorance and ambition of man, Presbyterianism is the most hideous.And what man who really thinks can help repeating the words of Ennius:
"If there are gods they certainly pay no attention to the affairs of
man."Events, like the pendulum of a clock have swung forward and backward,
but after all, man, like the hands, has gone steadily on.In spite of Church and dogma, there have been millions and millions of
men and women true to the loftiest and most generous promptings of the
human heart.I was taught to hate Catholicism with every drop of my blood, it is only
justice to say, that in all essential particulars it is precisely the
same as every other religion.Wherever brave blood has been shed, the sword of the Church has been
wet.On every chain has been the sign of the cross.The altar and throne
have leaned against and supported each other.We have all been taught by the Church that nothing is so well calculated
to excite the ire of the Deity as to express a doubt as to his
existence, and that to deny it is an unpardonable sin.Universal obedience is universal stagnation; disobedience is one of the
conditions of progress.Select any age of the world and tell me what
would have been the effect of implicit obedience.We have no national religion, and no national God; but every citizen
is allowed to have a religion and a God of his own, or to reject all
religions and deny the existence of all gods.Whatever may be the truth upon any subject has nothing to do with our
right to investigate that subject, and express any opinion we may form.All that I ask, is the same right I freely accord to all others.Mental slavery is mental death, and every man who has given up his
intellectual freedom is the living coffin of his dead soul.In this
sense, every church is a cemetery and every creed an epitaph.Think of reading the 109th Psalm to a heathen who has a Bible of his own
in which is found this passage: "Blessed is the man and beloved of all
the gods, who is afraid of no man, and of whom no man is afraid."The trouble with most people is, they bow to what is called authority;
they have a certain reverence for the old because it is old.They think
a man is better for being dead, especially if he has been dead a long
time.We should all remember that to be like other people is to be unlike
ourselves, and that nothing can be more detestable in character than
servile imitation.The great trouble with imitation is, that we are apt
to ape those who are in reality far below us.Suppose the Church had had absolute control of the human mind at any
time, would not the words liberty and progress have been blotted from
human speech?In defiance of advice, the world has advanced.Over every fortress of tyranny has waved, and still waves, the banner of
the Church.The Church has won no victories for the rights of man.We have advanced in spite of religious zeal, ignorance, and opposition.Luther labored to reform the Church--Voltaire, to reform men.There have been, and still are, too many men who own themselves--too
much thought, too much knowledge for the Church to grasp again the
sword of power.For the Eg-lon of superstition
Science has a message from Truth.It is a blessed thing that in every age some one has had individuality
enough and courage enough to stand by his own convictions,--some one
who had the grandeur to say his say."The Church says the earth is flat; but I have seen its shadow on the
moon, and I have more confidence even in a shadow than in the Church.""On the prow of his ship were disobedience, defiance, scorn, and
success.INGERSOLL'S ORATION AT HIS BROTHER'S GRAVE

     A Tribute to Ebon C. Ingersoll, by his Brother
     Robert--The Record of a Generous Life Runs
     Like a  Vine Around the Memory of our
     Dead,   and   Every   Sweet,   Unselfish
     Act is Now a Perfumed Flower.Dear Friends: I am going to do that which the dead oft promised he would
do for me.The loved and loving brother, husband, father, friend, died where
manhood's morning almost touches noon, and while the shadows still were
falling toward the west.He had not passed on life's highway the stone that marks the highest
point; but, being weary for a moment, he lay down by the wayside, and,
using his burden for a pillow, fell into that dreamless sleep that
kisses down his eyelids still.While yet in love with life and raptured
with the world, he passed to silence and pathetic dust.Yet, after all, it may be best, just in the happiest, sunniest hour
of all the voyage, while eager winds are kissing every sail, to dash
against the unseen rock, and in an instant hear the billows roar above a
sunken ship For whether in mid sea or '<DW41> the breakers of the farther
shore, a wreck at last must mark the end of each and all.And every
life, no matter if its every hour is rich with love and every moment
jeweled with a joy, will, at its close, become a tragedy as sad and deep
and dark as can be woven of the warp and woof of mystery and death.This brave and tender man in every storm of life was oak and rock; but
in the sunshine he was vine and flower.He was the friend of all heroic
souls.He climbed the heights, and left all superstitions far below,
while on his forehead fell the golden dawning of the grander day.He loved the beautiful, and was with color, form, and music touched to
tears.He sided with the weak, the poor, and wronged, and lovingly
gave alms.With loyal heart and with the purest hands he faithfully
discharged all public trusts.He was a worshiper of liberty, a friend of the oppressed.A thousand
times I have heard him quote these words: "For Justice all place a
temple, and all season, summer."He believed that happiness was the only
good, reason the only torch, justice the only worship, humanity the only
religion, and love the only priest.He added to the sum of human joy;
and were every one to whom he did some loving service to bring a blossom
to his grave, he would sleep to-night beneath a wilderness of sweet
flowers.Life is a narrow vale between the cold and barren peaks of two
eternities.We strive in vain to look beyond the heights.We cry aloud,
and the only answer is the echo of our wailing cry.From the voiceless
lips of the unreplying dead there comes no word; but in the night of
death hope sees a star and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing.He who sleeps here, when dying, mistaking the approach of death for the
return of health, whispered with his latest breath, "I am better now."Let us believe, in spite of doubts and dogmas, of fears and tears, that
these dear words are true of all the countless dead.And now, to you, who have been chosen, from among the many men he loved,
to do the last sad office for the dead, we give his sacred dust.There was, there is, no gentler,
stronger, manlier man.INGERSOLL'S DREAM OF THE WAR

     The Following Words of Matchless Eloquence were
     Addressed by Col.Ingersoll to the Veteran
     Soldiers of Indianapolis.The past, as it were, rises before me like a dream.Again we are in the
great struggle for national life.We hear the sound of preparation--the
music of the boisterous drums--the silver voices of heroic bugles.We
see thousands of assemblages, and hear the appeals of orators; we see
the pale cheeks of women, and the flushed faces of men; and in those
assemblages we see all the dead whose dust we have covered with flowers.We are with them when they enlist in the
great army of freedom.Some are
walking for the last time in quiet, woody places with the maidens they
adore.We hear the whisperings and the sweet vows of eternal love as
they lingeringly part forever.Others are bending over cradles kissing
babes that are asleep.Some are parting with
mothers who hold them and press them to their hearts again and again,
and say nothing; and some are talking with wives, and endeavoring with
brave words spoken in the old tones to drive away the awful fear.We see the wife standing in the door with the babe in her
arms--standing in the sunlight sobbing--at the turn of the road a hand
waves--she answers by holding high in her loving hands the child.We see them all as they march proudly away under the flaunting flags,
keeping time to the wild music of war--marching down the streets of the
great cities--through the towns and across the prairies--down to the
fields of glory, and do and to die for the eternal right.We are by their side on all the gory
fields, in all the hospitals of pain--on all the weary marches.We stand
guard with them in the wild storm and under the quiet stars.We are with
them in ravines running with blood--in the furrows of old fields.We are
with them between contending hosts, unable to move, wild with thirst,
the life ebbing slowly away among the withered leaves.We see them
pierced by balls and torn with shells in the trenches of forts, and in
the whirlwind of the charge, where men become iron with nerves of steel.We are with them in the prisons of hatred and famine, but human speech
can never tell what they endured.We are at home when the news comes that they are dead.We see the maiden
in the shadow of her sorrow.We see the silvered head of the old man
bowed with the last grief.The past rises before us, and we see four millions of human beings
governed by the lash--we see them bound hand and foot--we hear the
strokes of cruel whips--we see the hounds tracking women through
tangled swamps.We see babes sold from the breasts of mothers.Four million bodies in chains--four million souls in fetters.All the
sacred relations of wife, mother, father and child trampled beneath the
brutal feet of might.All this was done under our own beautiful banner
of the free.We hear the roar and shriek of the bursting
shell.Instead of
slaves we see men and women and children.The wand of progress touches
the auction-block, the slave-pen, and the whipping-post, and we see
homes and firesides, and school-houses and books, and where all was want
and crime, and cruelty and fear, we see the faces of the free.They died for liberty--they died for us.They
are at rest, They sleep in the land they made free, under the flag
they rendered stainless, under the solemn pines, the sad hemlocks, the
tearful willows, the embracing vines.They sleep beneath the shadows of
the clouds, careless alike of sunshine or storm, each in the window-less
palace of rest.Earth may run red with other wars--they are at peace.In
the midst of battle, in the roar of conflict, they found the serenity of
death.I have one sentiment for the soldiers living and dead--cheers for
the living and tears for the dead.It is not necessary to be a pig in order to raise one.A blow from a parent leaves a scar on the soul of the child.A mortgage casts a shadow on the sunniest field.Agriculture is the basis of all wealth.It is better to be a whole farmer than part of a mechanic.One good school-master is worth a thousand priests.Out in the intellectual sea there is room for every sail.An honest God is the noblest work of man.A King is a non-producing thief, sitting on a throne, surrounded by
vermin.Whiskey is the son of villainies, the father of all crimes, the mother
of all abominations, the devil's best friend, and God's worst enemy.An Orthodox Man is a gentleman petrified in his mind.Chicago is a marvel of energy, a miracle of nerva

The Pulpit is a pillory.Civilization is the Child of Forethought

Prejudice is the Child of Ignorance.I believe in the democracy of the fireside, in the republicanism of the
home.I believe in truth, in
investigation, in forethought.I believe in the gospel of education, of cheerfulness, of justice and
intelligence.GRYCE EXPLAINS HIMSELF


    "Sits the wind in that corner?"I DO not propose to enter into a description of the mingled feelings
aroused in me by this announcement.As a drowning man is said to live
over in one terrible instant the events of a lifetime, so each word
uttered in my hearing by Mary, from her first introduction to me in her
own room, on the morning of the inquest, to our final conversation on
the night of Mr.Clavering's call, swept in one wild phantasmagoria
through my brain, leaving me aghast at the signification which her whole
conduct seemed to acquire from the lurid light which now fell upon it."I perceive that I have pulled down an avalanche of doubts about your
ears," exclaimed my companion from the height of his calm superiority."You never thought of this possibility, then, yourself?""Do not ask me what I have thought.I only know I will never believe
your suspicions true.That, however much Mary may have been benefited by
her uncle's death, she never had a hand in it; actual hand, I mean.""And what makes you so sure of this?""And what makes you so sure of the contrary?It is for you to prove, not
for me to prove her innocence."Gryce, in his slow, sarcastic way, "you recollect that
principle of law, do you?If I remember rightly, you have not always
been so punctilious in regarding it, or wishing to have it regarded,
when the question was whether Mr.It does not seem so dreadful to accuse a man of a
crime.I cannot listen to it; it is
horrible.Nothing short of absolute confession on her part will ever
make me believe Mary Leavenworth, or any other woman, committed this
deed.It was too cruel, too deliberate, too----"

"Read the criminal records," broke in Mr."I do not care for the criminal records.All the
criminal records in the world would never make me believe Eleanore
perpetrated this crime, nor will I be less generous towards her cousin.Mary Leavenworth is a faulty woman, but not a guilty one.""You are more lenient in your judgment of her than her cousin was, it
appears.""I do not understand you," I muttered, feeling a new and yet more
fearful light breaking upon me.have you forgotten, in the hurry of these late events, the
sentence of accusation which we overheard uttered between these ladies
on the morning of the inquest?""No, but----"

"You believed it to have been spoken by Mary to Eleanore?"I left that
baby-play for you.I thought one was enough to follow on that tack."The light, the light that was breaking upon me!"And do you mean to say
it was Eleanore who was speaking at that time?That I have been laboring
all these weeks under a terrible mistake, and that you could have
righted me with a word, and did not?""Well, as to that, I had a purpose in letting you follow your own lead
for a while.In the first place, I was not sure myself which spoke;
though I had but little doubt about the matter.The voices are, as you
must have noticed, very much alike, while the attitudes in which we
found them upon entering were such as to be explainable equally by the
supposition that Mary was in the act of launching a denunciation, or in
that of repelling one.So that, while I did not hesitate myself as to
the true explanation of the scene before me, I was pleased to find you
accept a contrary one; as in this way both theories had a chance of
being tested; as was right in a case of so much mystery.You accordingly
took up the affair with one idea for your starting-point, and I with
another.You saw every fact as it developed through the medium of Mary's
belief in Eleanore's guilt, and I through the opposite.With you, doubt, contradiction, constant unsettlement,
and unwarranted resorts to strange sources for reconcilement between
appearances and your own convictions; with me, growing assurance, and
a belief which each and every development so far has but served to
strengthen and make more probable."Again that wild panorama of events, looks, and words swept before me.Mary's reiterated assertions of her cousin's innocence, Eleanore's
attitude of lofty silence in regard to certain matters which might be
considered by her as pointing towards the murderer."Your theory must be the correct one," I finally admitted; "it was
undoubtedly Eleanore who spoke.She believes in Mary's guilt, and I have
been blind, indeed, not to have seen it from the first.""If Eleanore Leavenworth believes in her cousin's criminality, she must
have some good reasons for doing so.""She did not conceal in her bosom that
telltale key,--found who knows where?--and destroy, or seek to destroy,
it and the letter which introduced her cousin to the public as the
unprincipled destroyer of a trusting man's peace, for nothing.""And yet you, a stranger, a young man who have never seen Mary
Leavenworth in any other light than that in which her coquettish nature
sought to display itself, presume to say she is innocent, in the face of
the attitude maintained from the first by her cousin!""But," said I, in my great unwillingness to accept his conclusions,
"Eleanore Leavenworth is but mortal.She may have been mistaken in her
inferences.She has never stated what her suspicion was founded upon;
nor can we know what basis she has for maintaining the attitude you
speak of.Clavering is as likely as Mary to be the assassin, for all we
know, and possibly for all she knows.""You seem to be almost superstitious in your belief in Clavering's
guilt."Harwell's fanciful conviction in
regard to this man had in any way influenced me to the detriment of my
better judgment?"I do not pretend to be set
in my notions.Future investigation may succeed in fixing something upon
him; though I hardly think it likely.His behavior as the secret husband
of a woman possessing motives for the commission of a crime has been too
consistent throughout.""No exception at all; for he hasn't left her.""I mean that, instead of leaving the country, Mr.Clavering has only
made pretence of doing so.That, in place of dragging himself off to
Europe at her command, he has only changed his lodgings, and can now be
found, not only in a house opposite to hers, but in the window of that
house, where he sits day after day watching who goes in and out of her
front door."I remembered his parting injunction to me, in that memorable interview
we had in my office, and saw myself compelled to put a new construction
upon it."But I was assured at the Hoffman House that he had sailed for Europe,
and myself saw the man who professes to have driven him to the steamer.""In another carriage, and to another house.""And you tell me that man is all right?""No; I only say there isn't the shadow of evidence against him as the
person who shot Mr.Rising, I paced the floor, and for a few minutes silence fell between
us.But the clock, striking, recalled me to the necessity of the hour,
and, turning, I asked Mr."There is but one thing I can do," said he."To go upon such lights as I have, and cause the arrest of Miss
Leavenworth."I had by this time schooled myself to endurance, and was able to hear
this without uttering an exclamation.But I could not let it pass
without making one effort to combat his determination."But," said I, "I do not see what evidence you have, positive enough in
its character, to warrant extreme measures.You have yourself intimated
that the existence of motive is not enough, even though taken with
the fact of the suspected party being in the house at the time of the
murder; and what more have you to urge against Miss Leavenworth?"I said 'Miss Leavenworth'; I should have said 'Eleanore
Leavenworth.'"when you and all unite in thinking that she alone of
all these parties to the crime is utterly guiltless of wrong?""And yet who is the only one against whom positive testimony of any kind
can be brought."Raymond," he remarked very gravely; "the public is becoming
clamorous; something must be done to satisfy it, if only for the moment.Eleanore has laid herself open to the suspicion of the police, and
must take the consequences of her action.I am sorry; she is a noble
creature; I admire her; but justice is justice, and though I think her
innocent, I shall be forced to put her under arrest unless----"

"But I cannot be reconciled to it.It is doing an irretrievable injury
to one whose only fault is an undue and mistaken devotion to an unworthy
cousin."Unless something occurs between now and tomorrow morning," Mr.Gryce
went on, as if I had not spoken.I tried to realize it; tried to face the fact that all my efforts had
been for nothing, and failed."Will you not grant me one more day?"Clavering, and force from him the
truth.""To make a mess of the whole affair!""No, sir; the die is
cast.Eleanore Leavenworth knows the one point which fixes this
crime upon her cousin, and she must tell us that point or suffer the
consequences of her refusal."Having exhausted so much time already in our
inquiries, why not take a little more; especially as the trail is
constantly growing warmer?A little more moleing----"

"A little more folderol!""No,
sir; the hour for moleing has passed; something decisive has got to be
done now; though, to be sure, if I could find the one missing link I
want----"

"Missing link?"The immediate motive of the tragedy; a bit of proof that Mr.Leavenworth threatened his niece with his displeasure, or Mr.Clavering
with his revenge, would place me on the vantage-point at once; no
arresting of Eleanore then!I would walk right into your
own gilded parlors, and when you asked me if I had found the murderer
yet, say 'yes,' and show you a bit of paper which would surprise you!This has been moled for, and
moled for, as you are pleased to call our system of investigation, and
totally without result.Nothing but the confession of some one of these
several parties to the crime will give us what we want.I will tell you
what I will do," he suddenly cried."Miss Leavenworth has desired me to
report to her; she is very anxious for the detection of the murderer,
you know, and offers an immense reward.Well, I will gratify this desire
of hers.The suspicions I have, together with my reasons for them, will
make an interesting disclosure.I should not greatly wonder if they
produced an equally interesting confession."I could only jump to my feet in my horror."At all events, I propose to try it.Eleanore is worth that much risk
any way.""It will do no good," said I."If Mary is guilty, she will never confess
it.If not----"

"She will tell us who is.""Not if it is Clavering, her husband.""Yes; even if it is Clavering, her husband.She has not the devotion of
Eleanore."She would hide no keys for the sake of
shielding another: no, if Mary were accused, she would speak.The future
opening before us looked sombre enough.And yet when, in a short time
from that, I found myself alone in a busy street, the thought that
Eleanore was free rose above all others, filling and moving me till my
walk home in the rain that day has become a marked memory of my life.It was only with nightfall that I began to realize the truly critical
position in which Mary stood if Mr.But,
once seized with this thought, nothing could drive it from my mind.Shrink as I would, it was ever before me, haunting me with the direst
forebodings.Nor, though I retired early, could I succeed in getting
either sleep or rest.All night I tossed on my pillow, saying over to
myself with dreary iteration: "Something must happen, something will
happen, to prevent Mr.Then I would
start up and ask what could happen; and my mind would run over various
contingencies, such as,--Mr.Clavering might confess; Hannah might come
back; Mary herself wake up to her position and speak the word I had more
than once seen trembling on her lips.But further thought showed me how
unlikely any of these things were to happen, and it was with a brain
utterly exhausted that I fell asleep in the early dawn, to dream I saw
Mary standing above Mr.I was awakened
from this pleasing vision by a heavy knock at the door.Hastily rising,
I asked who was there.The answer came in the shape of an envelope
thrust under the door.Raising it, I found it to be a note.Gryce, and ran thus:

"Come at once; Hannah Chester is found.""Sit down, and I will tell you."Drawing up a chair in a flurry of hope and fear, I sat down by Mr."She is not in the cupboard," that person dryly assured me, noting
without doubt how my eyes went travelling about the room in my anxiety
and impatience."We are not absolutely sure that she is anywhere.But
word has come to us that a girl's face believed to be Hannah's has been
seen at the upper window of a certain house in--don't start--R----,
where a year ago she was in the habit of visiting while at the hotel
with the Misses Leavenworth.Now, as it has already been determined that
she left New York the night of the murder, by the ------ ----Railroad,
though for what point we have been unable to ascertain, we consider the
matter worth inquiring into.""But--"

"If she is there," resumed Mr.Gryce, "she is secreted; kept very
close.No one except the informant has ever seen her, nor is there any
suspicion among the neighbors of her being in town.""Hannah secreted at a certain house in R----?Gryce honored me with one of his grimmest smiles."The name of
the lady she's with is given in the communication as Belden; Mrs.the name found written on a torn envelope by Mr."Then we are upon the
verge of some discovery; Providence has interfered, and Eleanore will be
saved!"Last night, or rather this morning; Q brought it.""It was a message, then, to Q?""Yes, the result of his moleings while in R----, I suppose.""A respectable tinsmith who lives next door to Mrs."And is this the first you knew of an Amy Belden living in R----?""Don't know; don't know anything about her but her name.""But you have already sent Q to make inquiries?""No; the affair is a little too serious for him to manage alone.He is
not equal to great occasions, and might fail just for the lack of a keen
mind to direct him.""In short----"

"I wish you to go.Since I cannot be there myself, I know of no one else
sufficiently up in the affair to conduct it to a successful issue.You see, it is not enough to find and identify the girl.The present
condition of things demands that the arrest of so important a witness
should be kept secret.Now, for a man to walk into a strange house in a
distant village, find a girl who is secreted there, frighten her,
cajole her, force her, as the case may be, from her hiding-place to a
detective's office in New York, and all without the knowledge of the
next-door neighbor, if possible, requires judgment, brains, genius.She must have her reasons for doing so; and
they must be known.Altogether, the affair is a delicate one."To think what pleasure I am
losing on your account!"he grumbled, gazing reproachfully at his
helpless limbs.a train leaves the depot at 12.15.Once in R----,
it will be for you to decide upon the means of making Mrs.Belden's
acquaintance without arousing her suspicions.Q, who will follow you,
will hold himself in readiness to render you any assistance you may
require.Only this thing is to be understood: as he will doubtless go in
disguise, you are not to recognize him, much less interfere with him
and his plans, till he gives you leave to do so, by some preconcerted
signal.You are to work in your way, and he in his, till circumstances
seem to call for mutual support and countenance.I cannot even say
whether you will see him or not; he may find it necessary to keep out of
the way; but you may be sure of one thing, that he will know where
you are, and that the display of, well, let us say a red silk
handkerchief--have you such a thing?""Will be regarded by him as a sign that you desire his presence or
assistance, whether it be shown about your person or at the window of
your room.""And these are all the instructions you can give me?""Yes, I don't know of anything else.You must depend largely upon your
own discretion, and the exigencies of the moment.I cannot tell you now
what to do.Only, if possible, let
me either hear from you or see you by to-morrow at this time."And he handed me a cipher in case I should wish to telegraph.HANNAH



XXVII.AMY BELDEN


    "A merrier man
    Within the limits of becoming mirth,
    I never spent an hour's talk withal."I HAD a client in R---- by the name of Monell; and it was from him I
had planned to learn the best way of approaching Mrs.When,
therefore, I was so fortunate as to meet him, almost on my arrival,
driving on the long road behind his famous trotter Alfred, I regarded
the encounter as a most auspicious beginning of a very doubtful
enterprise.was his exclamation as, the first
greetings passed, we drove rapidly into town."Your part in it goes pretty smoothly," I returned; and thinking I could
never hope to win his attention to my own affairs till I had satisfied
him in regard to his, I told him all I could concerning the law-suit
then pending; a subject so prolific of question and answer, that we
had driven twice round the town before he remembered he had a letter to
post.As it was an important one, admitting of no delay, we hasted at
once to the post-office, where he went in, leaving me outside to watch
the rather meagre stream of goers and comers who at that time of day
make the post-office of a country town their place of rendezvous.Among
these, for some reason, I especially noted one middle-aged woman; why, I
cannot say; her appearance was anything but remarkable.And yet when
she came out, with two letters in her hand, one in a large and one in a
small envelope, and meeting my eye hastily drew them under her shawl,
I found myself wondering what was in her letters and who she could be,
that the casual glance of a stranger should unconsciously move her to an
action so suspicious.Monell's reappearance at the same moment,
diverted my attention, and in the interest of the conversation that
followed, I soon forgot both the woman and her letters.For determined
that he should have no opportunity to revert to that endless topic, a
law case, I exclaimed with the first crack of the whip,--"There, I knew
there was something I wanted to ask you.It is this: Are you acquainted
with any one is this town by the name of Belden?""There is a widow Belden in town; I don't know of any other.""Who is she, what is she, and what is the
extent of your acquaintance with her?""Well," said he, " I cannot conceive why you should be interested in
such an antiquated piece of commonplace goodness as she is, but seeing
you ask, I have no objection to telling you that she is the very
respectable relict of a deceased cabinetmaker of this town; that she
lives in a little house down the street there, and that if you have any
forlorn old tramp to be lodged over night, or any destitute family of
little ones to be looked after, she is the one to go to.As to knowing
her, I know her as I do a dozen other members of our church there up
over the hill.When I see her I speak to her, and that is all.""No; lives alone, has a little income, I believe; must have, to put the
money on the plate she always does; but spends her time in plain sewing
and such deeds of charity, as one with small means but willing heart can
find the opportunity of doing in a town like this.But why in the name
of wonders do you ask?"Belden--don't mention it by the
way--has got mixed up in a case of mine, and I felt it due to my
curiosity if not to my purse, to find out something about her.The fact is I would give something, Monell, for the
opportunity of studying this woman's character.Now couldn't you manage
to get me introduced into her house in some way that would make it
possible and proper for me to converse with her at my leisure?"Well, I don't know; I suppose it could be done.She used to take
lodgers in the summer when the hotel was full, and might be induced
to give a bed to a friend of mine who is very anxious to be near the
post-office on account of a business telegram he is expecting, and which
when it comes will demand his immediate attention."Monell gave
me a sly wink of his eye, little imagining how near the mark he had
struck.Tell her I have a peculiar dislike to sleeping
in a public house, and that you know of no one better fitted to
accommodate me, for the short time I desire to be in town, than
herself.""And what will be said of my hospitality in allowing you under these
circumstances to remain in any other house than my own?""I don't know; very hard things, no doubt; but I guess your hospitality
can stand it.""Well, if you persist, we will see what can be done."And driving up to
a neat white cottage of homely, but sufficiently attractive appearance,
he stopped."This is her house," said he, jumping to the ground; "let's go in and
see what we can do."Glancing up at the windows, which were all closed save the two on the
veranda overlooking the street, I thought to myself, "If she has anybody
in hiding here, whose presence in the house she desires to keep secret,
it is folly to hope she will take me in, however well recommended I may
come."But, yielding to the example of my friend, I alighted in my turn
and followed him up the short, grass-bordered walk to the front door."As she has no servant, she will come to the door herself, so be ready,"
he remarked as he knocked.I had barely time to observe that the curtains to the window at my left
suddenly dropped, when a hasty step made itself heard within, and a
quick hand drew open the door; and I saw before me the woman whom I
had observed at the post-office, and whose action with the letters had
struck me as peculiar.I recognized her at first glance, though she
was differently dressed, and had evidently passed through some worry or
excitement that had altered the expression of her countenance, and
made her manner what it was not at that time, strained and a trifle
uncertain.But I saw no reason for thinking she remembered me.On the
contrary, the look she directed towards me had nothing but inquiry in
it, and when Mr.Monell pushed me forward with the remark, "A friend
of mine; in fact my lawyer from New York," she dropped a hurried
old-fashioned curtsey whose only expression was a manifest desire to
appear sensible of the honor conferred upon her, through the mist of a
certain trouble that confused everything about her."We have come to ask a favor, Mrs.Belden; but may we not come in?"said
my client in a round, hearty voice well calculated to recall a person's
thoughts into their proper channel."I have heard many times of your
cosy home, and am glad of this opportunity of seeing it."And with a
blind disregard to the look of surprised resistance with which she met
his advance, he stepped gallantly into the little room whose cheery
red carpet and bright picture-hung walls showed invitingly through the
half-open door at our left.Finding her premises thus invaded by a sort of French _coup d'etat,_
Mrs.Belden made the best of the situation, and pressing me to enter
also, devoted herself to hospitality.Monell, he quite
blossomed out in his endeavors to make himself agreeable; so much so,
that I shortly found myself laughing at his sallies, though my heart was
full of anxiety lest, after all, our efforts should fail of the success
they certainly merited.Belden softened more and more,
joining in the conversation with an ease hardly to be expected from one
in her humble circumstances.Indeed, I soon saw she was no common woman.There was a refinement in her speech and manner, which, combined with
her motherly presence and gentle air, was very pleasing.The last woman
in the world to suspect of any underhanded proceeding, if she had not
shown a peculiar hesitation when Mr.Monell broached the subject of my
entertainment there."I don't know, sir; I would be glad, but," and she turned a very
scrutinizing look upon me, "the fact is, I have not taken lodgers of
late, and I have got out of the way of the whole thing, and am afraid I
cannot make him comfortable.In short, you will have to excuse me.""What, entice a fellow into a room
like this"--and he cast a hearty admiring glance round the apartment
which, for all its simplicity, both its warm coloring and general air of
cosiness amply merited, "and then turn a cold shoulder upon him when he
humbly entreats the honor of staying a single night in the enjoyment
of its attractions?Belden; I know you too well for that.Lazarus himself couldn't come to your door and be turned away; much less
a good-hearted, clever-headed young gentleman like my friend here.""You are very good," she began, an almost weak love of praise showing
itself for a moment in her eyes; "but I have no room prepared.I have
been house-cleaning, and everything is topsy-turvy Mrs.Wright, now,
over the way----"

"My young friend is going to stop here," Mr.Mouell broke in, with frank
positiveness."If I cannot have him at my own house,--and for certain
reasons it is not advisable,--I shall at least have the satisfaction of
knowing he is in the charge of the best housekeeper in R----.""Yes," I put in, but without too great a show of interest; "I should be
sorry, once introduced here, to be obliged to go elsewhere."The troubled eye wavered away from us to the door."I was never called inhospitable," she commenced; "but everything in
such disorder."I was in hopes I might remain now," I replied; "I have some letters
to write, and ask nothing better than for leave to sit here and write
them."At the word letters I saw her hand go to her pocket in a movement which
must have been involuntary, for her countenance did not change, and she
made the quick reply:

"Well, you may.If you can put up with such poor accommodations as I can
offer, it shall not be said I refused you what Mr.Monell is pleased to
call a favor."And, complete in her reception as she had been in her resistance, she
gave us a pleasant smile, and, ignoring my thanks, bustled out with Mr.Monell to the buggy, where she received my bag and what was, doubtless,
more to her taste, the compliments he was now more than ever ready to
bestow upon her."I will see that a room is got ready for you in a very short space of
time," she said, upon re-entering."Meanwhile, make yourself at home
here; and if you wish to write, why I think you will find everything for
the purpose in these drawers."And wheeling up a table to the easy chair
in which I sat, she pointed to the small compartments beneath, with
an air of such manifest desire to have me make use of anything and
everything she had, that I found myself wondering over my position with
a sort of startled embarrassment that was not remote from shame."Thank you; I have materials of my own," said I, and hastened to open my
bag and bring out the writing-case, which I always carried with me."Then I will leave you," said she; and with a quick bend and a short,
hurried look out of the window, she hastily quitted the room.I could hear her steps cross the hall, go up two or three stairs, pause,
go up the rest of the flight, pause again, and then pass on.I was left
on the first floor alone.A WEIRD EXPERIENCE


    "Flat burglary as ever was committed."THE first thing I did was to inspect with greater care the room in which
I sat.It was a pleasant apartment, as I have already said; square, sunny, and
well furnished.On the floor was a crimson carpet, on the walls several
pictures, at the windows, cheerful curtains of white, tastefully
ornamented with ferns and autumn leaves; in one corner an old melodeon,
and in the centre of the room a table draped with a bright cloth, on
which were various little knick-knacks which, without being rich or
expensive, were both pretty and, to a certain extent, ornamental.But
it was not these things, which I had seen repeated in many other country
homes, that especially attracted my attention, or drew me forward in the
slow march which I now undertook around the room.It was the something
underlying all these, the evidences which I found, or sought to find,
not only in the general aspect of the room, but in each trivial object
I encountered, of the character, disposition, and history of the woman
with whom I now had to deal.It was for this reason I studied the
daguerreotypes on the mantel-piece, the books on the shelf, and the
music on the rack; for this and the still further purpose of noting if
any indications were to be found of there being in the house any such
person as Hannah.First then, for the little library, which I was pleased to see occupied
one corner of the room.Composed of a few well-chosen books, poetical,
historical, and narrative, it was of itself sufficient to account
for the evidences of latent culture observable in Mrs.Taking out a well-worn copy of _Byron,_ I opened it.There
were many passages marked, and replacing the book with a mental comment
upon her evident impressibility to the softer emotions, I turned towards
the melodeon fronting me from the opposite wall.It was closed, but on
its neatly-covered top lay one or two hymn-books, a basket of russet
apples, and a piece of half-completed knitting work.I took up the latter, but was forced to lay it down again without a
notion for what it was intended.Proceeding, I next stopped before
a window opening upon the small yard that ran about the house, and
separated it from the one adjoining.The scene without failed to attract
me, but the window itself drew my attention, for, written with a diamond
point on one of the panes, I perceived a row of letters which, as
nearly as I could make out, were meant for some word or words, but which
utterly failed in sense or apparent connection.Passing it by as the
work of some school-girl, I glanced down at the work-basket standing on
a table at my side.It was full of various kinds of work, among which I
spied a pair of stockings, which were much too small, as well as in too
great a state of disrepair, to belong to Mrs.Belden; and drawing them
carefully out, I examined them for any name on them.Do not start when I
say I saw the letter H plainly marked upon them.Thrusting them back,
I drew a deep breath of relief, gazing, as I did so, out of the window,
when those letters again attracted my attention.Idly I began to read them backward, when--But try
for yourself, reader, and judge of my surprise!Elate at the discovery
thus made, I sat down to write my letters.I had barely finished them,
when Mrs.Belden came in with the announcement that supper was ready."As for your room," said she, "I have prepared my own room for your use,
thinking you would like to remain on the first floor."And, throwing
open a door at my side, she displayed a small, but comfortable room,
in which I could dimly see a bed, an immense bureau, and a shadowy
looking-glass in a dark, old-fashioned frame."I live in very primitive fashion," she resumed, leading the way into
the dining-room; "but I mean to be comfortable and make others so.""I should say you amply succeeded," I rejoined, with an appreciative
glance at her well-spread board.She smiled, and I felt I had paved the way to her good graces in a way
that would yet redound to my advantage.its dainties, its pleasant freedom, its
mysterious, pervading atmosphere of unreality, and the constant sense
which every bountiful dish she pressed upon me brought of the shame of
eating this woman's food with such feelings of suspicion in my heart!Shall I ever forget the emotion I experienced when I first perceived
she had something on her mind, which she longed, yet hesitated, to give
utterance to!Or how she started when a cat jumped from the sloping roof
of the kitchen on to the grass-plot at the back of the house; or how my
heart throbbed when I heard, or thought I heard, a board creak overhead!We were in a long and narrow room which seemed, curiously enough, to run
crosswise of the house, opening on one side into the parlor, and on the
other into the small bedroom, which had been allotted to my use."You live in this house alone, without fear?"Belden,
contrary to my desire, put another bit of cold chicken on my plate."Have you no marauders in this town: no tramps, of whom a solitary woman
like you might reasonably be afraid?""No one will hurt me," said she; "and no one ever came here for food or
shelter but got it.""I should think, then, that living as you do, upon a railroad, you would
be constantly overrun with worthless beings whose only trade is to take
all they can get without giving a return."It is the only luxury I have: to feed the
poor.""But the idle, restless ones, who neither will work, nor let others
work----"

"Are still the poor."Mentally remarking, here is the woman to shield an unfortunate who has
somehow become entangled in the meshes of a great crime, I drew back
from the table.As I did so, the thought crossed me that, in case
there was any such person in the house as Hannah, she would take the
opportunity of going up-stairs with something for her to eat; and that
she might not feel hampered by my presence, I stepped out on the veranda
with my cigar.While smoking it, I looked about for Q. I felt that the least token
of his presence in town would be very encouraging at this time.But it
seemed I was not to be afforded even that small satisfaction.If Q was
anywhere near, he was lying very low.Belden (who I know came down-stairs with an
empty plate, for going into the kitchen for a drink, I caught her in
the act of setting it down on the table), I made up my mind to wait a
reasonable length of time for what she had to say; and then, if she did
not speak, make an endeavor on my own part to surprise her secret.But her avowal was nearer and of a different nature from what I
expected, and brought its own train of consequences with it."You are a lawyer, I believe," she began, taking down her knitting work,
with a forced display of industry."Yes," I said; "that is my profession."She remained for a moment silent, creating great havoc in her work I am
sure, from the glance of surprise and vexation she afterwards threw it.Then, in a hesitating voice, remarked:

"Perhaps you may be willing, then, to give me some advice.The truth is,
I am in a very curious predicament; one from which I don't know how to
escape, and yet which demands immediate action.I should like to tell
you about it; may I?""You may; I shall be only too happy to give you any advice in my power."She drew in her breath with a sort of vague relief, though her forehead
did not lose its frown."It can all be said in a few words.I have in my possession a package of
papers which were intrusted to me by two ladies, with the understanding
that I should neither return nor destroy them without the full
cognizance and expressed desire of both parties, given in person or
writing.That they were to remain in my hands till then, and that
nothing or nobody should extort them from me.""That is easily understood," said I; for she stopped."But, now comes word from one of the ladies, the one, too, most
interested in the matter, that, for certain reasons, the immediate
destruction of those papers is necessary to her peace and safety.""And do you want to know what your duty is in this case?"I could not help it: a flood of conjectures rushing in tumult
over me."It is to hold on to the papers like grim death till released from your
guardianship by the combined wish of both parties."Once pledged in that way, you have no choice.It
would be a betrayal of trust to yield to the solicitations of one party
what you have undertaken to return to both.The fact that grief or loss
might follow your retention of these papers does not release you from
your bond.You have nothing to do with that; besides, you are by no
means sure that the representations of the so-called interested party
are true.You might be doing a greater wrong, by destroying in this way,
what is manifestly considered of value to them both, than by preserving
the papers intact, according to compact."Circumstances alter cases; and in short, it
seems to me that the wishes of the one most interested ought to be
regarded, especially as there is an estrangement between these ladies
which may hinder the other's consent from ever being obtained.""No," said I; "two wrongs never make a right; nor are we at liberty to
do an act of justice at the expense of an injustice.The papers must be
preserved, Mrs.Her head sank very despondingly; evidently it had been her wish to
please the interested party."Law is very hard," she said; "very hard.""This is not only law, but plain duty," I remarked."Suppose a case
different; suppose the honor and happiness of the other party depended
upon the preservation of the papers; where would your duty be then?""But----"

"A contract is a contract," said I, "and cannot be tampered with.Having
accepted the trust and given your word, you are obliged to fulfil, to
the letter, all its conditions.It would be a breach of trust for you to
return or destroy the papers without the mutual consent necessary."An expression of great gloom settled slowly over her features."I
suppose you are right," said she, and became silent.Watching her, I thought to myself, "If I were Mr.Gryce, or even Q, I
would never leave this seat till I had probed this matter to the bottom,
learned the names of the parties concerned, and where those precious
papers are hidden, which she declares to be of so much importance."But
being neither, I could only keep her talking upon the subject until
she should let fall some word that might serve as a guide to my further
enlightenment; I therefore turned, with the intention of asking her
some question, when my attention was attracted by the figure of a woman
coming out of the back-door of the neighboring house, who, for general
dilapidation and uncouthness of bearing, was a perfect type of the style
of tramp of whom we had been talking at the supper table.Gnawing a
crust which she threw away as she reached the street, she trudged down
the path, her scanty dress, piteous in its rags and soil, flapping in
the keen spring wind, and revealing ragged shoes red with the mud of the
highway."There is a customer that may interest you," said I.

Mrs.Belden seemed to awake from a trance.Rising slowly, she looked
out, and with a rapidly softening gaze surveyed the forlorn creature
before her.she muttered; "but I cannot do much for her to-night.A
good supper is all I can give her."And, going to the front door, she bade her step round the house to the
kitchen, where, in another moment, I heard the rough creature's voice
rise in one long "Bless you!"that could only have been produced by the
setting before her of the good things with which Mrs.Belden's larder
seemed teeming.After a decent length of time,
employed as I should judge in mastication, I heard her voice rise once
more in a plea for shelter."The barn, ma'am, or the wood-house.Any place where I can lie out of
the wind."And she commenced a long tale of want and disease, so piteous
to hear that I was not at all surprised when Mrs.Belden told me,
upon re-entering, that she had consented, notwithstanding her previous
determination, to allow the woman to lie before the kitchen fire for the
night."She has such an honest eye," said she; "and charity is my only luxury."The interruption of this incident effectually broke up our conversation.Belden went up-stairs, and for some time I was left alone to ponder
over what I had heard, and determine upon my future course of action.I
had just reached the conclusion that she would be fully as liable to
be carried away by her feelings to the destruction of the papers in her
charge, as to be governed by the rules of equity I had laid down to her,
when I heard her stealthily descend the stairs and go out by the front
door.Distrustful of her intentions, I took up my hat and hastily
followed her.She was on her way down the main street, and my first
thought was, that she was bound for some neighbor's house or perhaps for
the hotel itself; but the settled swing into which she soon altered her
restless pace satisfied me that she had some distant goal in prospect;
and before long I found myself passing the hotel with its appurtenances,
even the little schoolhouse, that was the last building at this end of
the village, and stepping out into the country beyond.But still her fluttering figure hasted on, the outlines of her form,
with its close shawl and neat bonnet, growing fainter and fainter in the
now settled darkness of an April night; and still I followed, walking on
the turf at the side of the road lest she should hear my footsteps and
look round.Over this I could hear her
pass, and then every sound ceased.She had paused, and was evidently
listening.It would not do for me to pause too, so gathering myself into
as awkward a shape as possible, I sauntered by her down the road, but
arrived at a certain point, stopped, and began retracing my steps with a
sharp lookout for her advancing figure, till I had arrived once more at
the bridge.Convinced now that she had discovered my motive for being in her house
and, by leading me from it, had undertaken to supply Hannah with an
opportunity for escape, I was about to hasten back to the charge I had
so incautiously left, when a strange sound heard at my left arrested me.It came from the banks of the puny stream which ran under the bridge,
and was like the creaking of an old door on worn-out hinges.Leaping the fence, I made my way as best I could down the sloping field
in the direction from which the sound came.It was quite dark, and my
progress was slow; so much so, that I began to fear I had ventured upon
a wild-goose chase, when an unexpected streak of lightning shot across
the sky, and by its glare I saw before me what seemed, in the momentary
glimpse I had of it, an old barn.From the rush of waters near at hand,
I judged it to be somewhere on the edge of the stream, and consequently
hesitated to advance, when I heard the sound of heavy breathing near me,
followed by a stir as of some one feeling his way over a pile of loose
boards; and presently, while I stood there, a faint blue light flashed
up from the interior of the barn, and I saw, through the tumbled-down
door that faced me, the form of Mrs.Belden standing with a lighted
match in her hand, gazing round on the four walls that encompassed her.Hardly daring to breathe, lest I should alarm her, I watched her while
she turned and peered at the roof above her, which was so old as to be
more than half open to the sky, at the flooring beneath, which was in
a state of equal dilapidation, and finally at a small tin box which she
drew from under her shawl and laid on the ground at her feet.The sight
of that box at once satisfied me as to the nature of her errand.She was
going to hide what she dared not destroy; and, relieved upon this point,
I was about to take a step forward when the match went out in her hand.While she was engaged in lighting another, I considered that perhaps it
would be better for me not to arouse her apprehensions by accosting her
at this time, and thus endanger the success of my main scheme; but
to wait till she was gone, before I endeavored to secure the box.Accordingly I edged my way up to the side of the barn and waited till
she should leave it, knowing that if I attempted to peer in at the
door, I ran great risk of being seen, owing to the frequent streaks of
lightning which now flashed about us on every side.Minute after minute
went by, with its weird alternations of heavy darkness and sudden
glare; and still she did not come.At last, just as I was about to start
impatiently from my hiding-place, she reappeared, and began to withdraw
with faltering steps toward the bridge.When I thought her quite out of
hearing, I stole from my retreat and entered the barn.It was of course
as dark as Erebus, but thanks to being a smoker I was as well provided
with matches as she had been, and having struck one, I held it up; but
the light it gave was very feeble, and as I did not know just where to
look, it went out before I had obtained more than a cursory glimpse of
the spot where I was.I thereupon lit another; but though I confined my
attention to one place, namely, the floor at my feet, it too went out
before I could conjecture by means of any sign seen there where she had
hidden the box.I now for the first time realized the difficulty before
me.She had probably made up her mind, before she left home, in just
what portion of this old barn she would conceal her treasure; but I had
nothing to guide me: I could only waste matches.A
dozen had been lit and extinguished before I was so much as sure the box
was not under a pile of debris that lay in one corner, and I had taken
the last in my hand before I became aware that one of the broken boards
of the floor was pushed a little out of its proper position.and that board was to be raised, the space beneath examined, and the
box, if there, lifted safely out.I concluded not to waste my resources,
so kneeling down in the darkness, I groped for the board, tried it, and
found it to be loose.Wrenching at it with all my strength, I tore it
free and cast it aside; then lighting my match looked into the hole thus
made.Something, I could not tell what, stone or box, met my eye, but
while I reached for it, the match flew out of my hand.Deploring my
carelessness, but determined at all hazards to secure what I had seen,
I dived down deep into the hole, and in another moment had the object of
my curiosity in my hands.Satisfied at this result of my efforts, I turned to depart, my one wish
now being to arrive home before Mrs.She had
several minutes the start of me; I would have to pass her on the road,
and in so doing might be recognized.Regaining the highway, I started at a brisk pace.For some little
distance I kept it up, neither overtaking nor meeting any one.But
suddenly, at a turn in the road, I came unexpectedly upon Mrs.Belden,
standing in the middle of the path, looking back.Somewhat disconcerted,
I hastened swiftly by her, expecting her to make some effort to stop me.Indeed, I doubt now if she even saw
or heard me.Astonished at this treatment, and still more surprised
that she made no attempt to follow me, I looked back, when I saw what
enchained her to the spot, and made her so unmindful of my presence.The
barn behind us was on fire!Instantly I realized it was the work of my hands; I had dropped a
half-extinguished match, and it had fallen upon some inflammable
substance.Aghast at the sight, I paused in my turn, and stood staring.Higher and
higher the red flames mounted, brighter and brighter glowed the clouds
above, the stream beneath; and in the fascination of watching it all,
I forgot Mrs.But a short, agitated gasp in my vicinity soon
recalled her presence to my mind, and drawing nearer, I heard her
exclaim like a person speaking in a dream, "Well, I didn't mean to do
it"; then lower, and with a certain satisfaction in her tone, "But it's
all right, any way; the thing is lost now for good, and Mary will be
satisfied without any one being to blame."I did not linger to hear more; if this was the conclusion she had come
to, she would not wait there long, especially as the sound of distant
shouts and running feet announced that a crowd of village boys was on
its way to the scene of the conflagration.The first thing I did, upon my arrival at the house, was to assure
myself that no evil effects had followed my inconsiderate desertion of
it to the mercies of the tramp she had taken in; the next to retire to
my room, and take a peep at the box.I found it to be a neat tin coffer,
fastened with a lock.Satisfied from its weight that it contained
nothing heavier than the papers of which Mrs.Belden had spoken, I hid
it under the bed and returned to the sitting-room.I had barely taken a
seat and lifted a book when Mrs.cried she, taking off her bonnet and revealing a face much
flushed with exercise, but greatly relieved in expression; "this _is_
a night!It lightens, and there is a fire somewhere down street, and
altogether it is perfectly dreadful out.I hope you have not been
lonesome," she continued, with a keen searching of my face which I
bore in the best way I could."I had an errand to attend to, but didn't
expect to stay so long."I returned some nonchalant reply, and she hastened from the room to
fasten up the house.I waited, but she did not come back; fearful, perhaps, of betraying
herself, she had retired to her own apartment, leaving me to take care
of myself as best I might.I own that I was rather relieved at this.The
fact is, I did not feel equal to any more excitement that night, and was
glad to put off further action until the next day.As soon, then, as
the storm was over, I myself went to bed, and, after several ineffectual
efforts, succeeded in getting asleep.THE MISSING WITNESS


    "I fled and cried out death."The voice was low and searching; it reached me in my dreams, waked me,
and caused me to look up.Morning had begun to break, and by its light I
saw, standing in the open door leading into the dining-room, the forlorn
figure of the tramp who had been admitted into the house the night
before.Angry and perplexed, I was about to bid her be gone, when, to my
great surprise, she pulled out a red handkerchief from her pocket, and I
recognized Q."Read that," said he, hastily advancing and putting a slip of paper into
my hand.And, without another word or look, left the room, closing the
door behind him.Rising in considerable agitation, I took it to the window, and by the
rapidly increasing light, succeeded in making out the rudely scrawled
lines as follows:

"She is here; I have seen her; in the room marked with a cross in the
accompanying plan.Wait till eight o'clock, then go up.I will contrive
some means of getting Mrs.Sketched below this was the following plan of the upper floor:

Hannah, then, was in the small back room over the dining-room, and I had
not been deceived in thinking I had heard steps overhead, the evening
before.Greatly relieved, and yet at the same time much moved at the
near prospect of being brought face to face with one who we had every
reason to believe was acquainted with the dreadful secret involved in
the Leavenworth murder, I lay down once more, and endeavored to catch
another hour's rest.But I soon gave up the effort in despair, and
contented myself with listening to the sounds of awakening life which
now began to make themselves heard in the house and neighborhood.As Q had closed the door after him, I could only faintly hear Mrs.Belden when she came down-stairs.But the short, surprised exclamation
which she uttered upon reaching the kitchen and finding the tramp gone
and the back-door wide open, came plainly enough to my ears, and for a
moment I was not sure but that Q had made a mistake in thus leaving so
unceremoniously.As she came, in the course of her preparations for breakfast, into the
room adjoining mine, I could hear her murmur to herself:

"Poor thing!She has lived so long in the fields and at the roadside,
she finds it unnatural to be cooped up in the house all night."The effort to eat and appear unconcerned,
to chat and make no mistake,--May I never be called upon to go through
such another!But at last it was over, and I was left free to await
in my own room the time for the dreaded though much-to-be-desired
interview.Slowly the minutes passed; eight o'clock struck, when, just
as the last vibration ceased, there came a loud knock at the backdoor,
and a little boy burst into the kitchen, crying at the top of his voice:
"Papa's got a fit!papa's got a fit; do come!"Rising, as was natural, I hastened towards the kitchen, meeting Mrs.Belden's anxious face in the doorway."A poor wood-chopper down the street has fallen in a fit," she said."Will you please watch over the house while I see what I can do for him?I won't be absent any longer than I can help."And almost without waiting for my reply, she caught up a shawl, threw
it over her head, and followed the urchin, who was in a state of great
excitement, out into the street.Instantly the silence of death seemed to fill the house, and a dread the
greatest I had ever experienced settled upon me.To leave the kitchen,
go up those stairs, and confront that girl seemed for the moment beyond
my power; but, once on the stair, I found myself relieved from the
especial dread which had overwhelmed me, and possessed, instead, of a
sort of combative curiosity that led me to throw open the door which
I saw at the top with a certain fierceness new to my nature, and not
altogether suitable, perhaps, to the occasion.I found myself in a large bedroom, evidently the one occupied by Mrs.Barely stopping to note certain evidences of
her having passed a restless night, I passed on to the door leading into
the room marked with a cross in the plan drawn for me by Q. It was a
rough affair, made of pine boards rudely painted.Pausing before it, I
listened.Raising the latch, I endeavored to enter.Pausing again, I bent my ear to the keyhole.Not a
sound came from within; the grave itself could not have been stiller.Awe-struck and irresolute, I looked about me and questioned what I had
best do.Suddenly I remembered that, in the plan Q had given me, I had
seen intimation of another door leading into this same room from the one
on the opposite side of the hall.Going hastily around to it, I tried
it with my hand.Convinced at last that
nothing was left me but force, I spoke for the first time, and, calling
the girl by name, commanded her to open the door.Receiving no response,
I said aloud with an accent of severity:

"Hannah Chester, you are discovered; if you do not open the door, we
shall be obliged to break it down; save us the trouble, then, and open
immediately."Going back a step, I threw my whole weight against the door.It creaked
ominously, but still resisted.Stopping only long enough to be sure no movement had taken place within,
I pressed against it once more, this time with all my strength, when it
flew from its hinges, and I fell forward into a room so stifling, chill,
and dark that I paused for a moment to collect my scattered senses
before venturing to look around me.In another
moment, the pallor and fixity of the pretty Irish face staring upon me
from amidst the tumbled clothes of a bed, drawn up against the wall at
my side, struck me with so deathlike a chill that, had it not been for
that one instant of preparation, I should have been seriously dismayed.As it was, I could not prevent a feeling of sickly apprehension from
seizing me as I turned towards the silent figure stretched so near, and
observed with what marble-like repose it lay beneath the patchwork quilt
drawn across it, asking myself if sleep could be indeed so like death
in its appearance.For that it was a sleeping woman I beheld, I did not
seriously doubt.There were too many evidences of careless life in the
room for any other inference.The clothes, left just as she had stepped
from them in a circle on the floor; the liberal plate of food placed
in waiting for her on the chair by the door, --food amongst which I
recognized, even in this casual glance, the same dish which we had had
for breakfast --all and everything in the room spoke of robust life and
reckless belief in the morrow.And yet so white was the brow turned up to the bare beams of the
unfinished wall above her, so glassy the look of the half-opened eyes,
so motionless the arm lying half under, half over, the edge of the
coverlid that it was impossible not to shrink from contact with a
creature so sunk in unconsciousness.But contact seemed to be necessary;
any cry which I could raise at that moment would be ineffectual enough
to pierce those dull ears.Nerving myself, therefore, I stooped and
lifted the hand which lay with its telltale scar mockingly uppermost,
intending to speak, call, do something, anything, to arouse her.But at
the first touch of her hand on mine an unspeakable horror thrilled me.It was not only icy cold, but stiff.Dropping it in my agitation, I
started back and again surveyed the face.What sleep ever wore such pallid hues, such accusing
fixedness?Bending once more I listened at the lips.Not a breath, nor a
stir.Shocked to the core of my being, I made one final effort.Tearing
down the clothes, I laid my hand upon her heart.BURNED PAPER


    "I could have better spared a better man."I DO not think I called immediately for help.The awful shock of this
discovery, coming as it did at the very moment life and hope were
strongest within me; the sudden downfall which it brought of all the
plans based upon this woman's expected testimony; and, worst of all, the
dread coincidence between this sudden death and the exigency in which
the guilty party, whoever it was, was supposed to be at that hour were
much too appalling for instant action.I could only stand and stare at
the quiet face before me, smiling in its peaceful rest as if death
were pleasanter than we think, and marvel over the providence which
had brought us renewed fear instead of relief, complication instead of
enlightenment, disappointment instead of realization.For eloquent as is
death, even on the faces of those unknown and unloved by us, the causes
and consequences of this one were much too important to allow the mind
to dwell upon the pathos of the scene itself.Hannah, the girl, was lost
in Hannah the witness.But gradually, as I gazed, the look of expectation which I perceived
hovering about the wistful mouth and half-open lids attracted me, and I
bent above her with a more personal interest, asking myself if she were
quite dead, and whether or not immediate medical assistance would be of
any avail.But the more closely I looked, the more certain I became
that she had been dead for some hours; and the dismay occasioned by this
thought, taken with the regrets which I must ever feel, that I had not
adopted the bold course the evening before, and, by forcing my way to
the hiding-place of this poor creature, interrupted, if not prevented
the consummation of her fate, startled me into a realization of my
present situation; and, leaving her side, I went into the next room,
threw up the window, and fastened to the blind the red handkerchief
which I had taken the precaution to bring with me.Instantly a young man, whom I was fain to believe Q, though he bore
not the least resemblance, either in dress or facial expression to
any renderings of that youth which I had yet seen, emerged from the
tinsmith's house, and approached the one I was in.Observing him cast a hurried glance in my direction, I crossed the
floor, and stood awaiting him at the head of the stairs.he whispered, upon entering the house and meeting my glance from
below; "have you seen her?""Yes," I returned bitterly, "I have seen her!""No; I have had no talk with her."Then, as I perceived him growing
alarmed at my voice and manner, I drew him into Mrs.Belden's room and
hastily inquired: "What did you mean this morning when you informed me
you had seen this girl?that she was in a certain room where I might
find her?""You have, then, been to her room?""No; I have only been on the outside of it.Seeing a light, I crawled up
on to the ledge of the slanting roof last night while both you and Mrs.Belden were out, and, looking through the window, saw her moving round
the room."He must have observed my countenance change, for he stopped."Come," I said, "and see for
yourself!"And, leading him to the little room I had just left, I
pointed to the silent form lying within."You told me I should
find Hannah here; but you did not tell me I should find her in this
condition."he cried with a start: "not dead?"It seemed as if he could not realize it."She is in a heavy sleep, has taken a narcotic----"

"It is not sleep," I said, "or if it is, she will never wake.And, taking the hand once more in mine, I let it fall in its stone
weight upon the bed.Calming down, he stood gazing at her
with a very strange expression upon his face.Suddenly he moved and
began quietly turning over the clothes that were lying on the floor."I am looking for the bit of paper from which I saw her take what I
supposed to be a dose of medicine last night.he cried,
lifting a morsel of paper that, lying on the floor under the edge of the
bed, had hitherto escaped his notice.He handed me the paper, on the inner surface of which I could dimly
discern the traces of an impalpable white powder."This is important," I declared, carefully folding the paper together."If there is enough of this powder remaining to show that the contents
of this paper were poisonous, the manner and means of the girl's death
are accounted for, and a case of deliberate suicide made evident.""I am not so sure of that," he retorted."If I am any judge of
countenances, and I rather flatter myself I am, this girl had no more
idea she was taking poison than I had.She looked not only bright but
gay; and when she tipped up the paper, a smile of almost silly triumph
crossed her face.Belden gave her that dose to take, telling her
it was medicine----"

"That is something which yet remains to be learned; also whether the
dose, as you call it, was poisonous or not.It may be she died of heart
disease."He simply shrugged his shoulders, and pointed first at the plate of
breakfast left on the chair, and secondly at the broken-down door."Yes," I said, answering his look, "Mrs.Belden has been in here this
morning, and Mrs.Belden locked the door when she went out; but that
proves nothing beyond her belief in the girl's hearty condition.""A belief which that white face on its tumbled pillow did not seem to
shake?""Perhaps in her haste she may not have looked at the girl, but have set
the dishes down without more than a casual glance in her direction?""I don't want to suspect anything wrong, but it is such a coincidence!"This was touching me on a sore point, and I stepped back."Well,"
said I, "there is no use in our standing here busying ourselves with
conjectures.and I moved hurriedly
towards the door."Have you forgotten this is but
an episode in the one great mystery we are sent here to unravel?If this
girl has come to her death by some foul play, it is our business to find
it out.""I know; but we can at least take full note of the room and everything
in it before throwing the affair into the hands of strangers.Gryce
will expect that much of us, I am sure."I am
only afraid I can never forget it."the lay of the bed-clothes
around it?the lack there is of all signs of struggle or fear?"Yes, yes; don't make me look at it any more."--rapidly pointing out each
object as he spoke.a calico dress, a shawl,--not the
one in which she was believed to have run away, but an old black
one, probably belonging to Mrs.Then this chest,"--opening
it,--"containing a few underclothes marked,--let us see, ah, with the
name of the lady of the house, but smaller than any she ever wore;
made for Hannah, you observe, and marked with her own name to prevent
suspicion.And then these other clothes lying on the floor, all new,
all marked in the same way.Going over to where he stood I stooped down, when a wash-bowl half full
of burned paper met my eye."I saw her bending over something in this corner, and could not think
what it was.Can it be she is a suicide after all?She has evidently
destroyed something here which she didn't wish any one to see.""Not a scrap, not a morsel left to show what it was; how unfortunate!"Belden must solve this riddle," I cried.Belden must solve the whole riddle," he replied; "the secret
of the Leavenworth murder hangs upon it."Then, with a lingering
look towards the mass of burned paper, "Who knows but what that was a
confession?""Whatever it was," said I, "it is now ashes, and we have got to accept
the fact and make the best of it.""Yes," said he with a deep sigh; "that's so; but Mr.Gryce will never
forgive me for it, never.He will say I ought to have known it was a
suspicious circumstance for her to take a dose of medicine at the very
moment detection stood at her back.""But she did not know that; she did not see you.""We don't know what she saw, nor what Mrs.Women are a
mystery; and though I flatter myself that ordinarily I am a match for
the keenest bit of female flesh that ever walked, I must say that in
this case I feel myself thoroughly and shamefully worsted.""Well, well," I said, "the end has not come yet; who knows what a talk
with Mrs.And, by the way, she will be coming
back soon, and I must be ready to meet her.Everything depends upon
finding out, if I can, whether she is aware of this tragedy or not.It
is just possible she knows nothing about it."And, hurrying him from the room, I pulled the door to behind me, and led
the way down-stairs."Now," said I, "there is one thing you must attend to at once.Gryce acquainting him with this unlooked-for
occurrence.""All right, sir," and Q started for the door."I may not have another opportunity to
mention it.Belden received two letters from the postmaster
yesterday; one in a large and one in a small envelope; if you could find
out where they were postmarked----"

Q put his hand in his pocket."I think I will not have to go far to
find out where one of them came from.And
before I knew it, he had returned up-stairs."THEREBY HANGS A TALE.""IT was all a hoax; nobody was ill; I have been imposed upon, meanly
imposed upon!"Belden, flushed and panting, entered the room
where I was, and proceeded to take off her bonnet; but whilst doing so
paused, and suddenly exclaimed: "What is the matter?"Something very serious has occurred," I replied; "you have been gone
but a little while, but in that time a discovery has been made--" I
purposely paused here that the suspense might elicit from her some
betrayal; but, though she turned pale, she manifested less emotion than
I expected, and I went on--"which is likely to produce very important
consequences.""I always said it would be impossible to keep it secret
if I let anybody into the house; she is so restless.But I forget," she
suddenly said, with a frightened look; "you haven't told me what the
discovery was.Perhaps it isn't what I thought; perhaps----"

I did not hesitate to interrupt her.Belden," I said, "I shall not
try to mitigate the blow.A woman who, in the face of the most urgent
call from law and justice, can receive into her house and harbor there a
witness of such importance as Hannah, cannot stand in need of any great
preparation for hearing that her efforts, have been too successful, that
she has accomplished her design of suppressing valuable testimony, that
law and justice are outraged, and that the innocent woman whom this
girl's evidence might have saved stands for ever compromised in the eyes
of the world, if not in those of the officers of the law."Her eyes, which had never left me during this address, flashed wide with
dismay."I have intended no wrong; I have only
tried to save people.What have you got to do
with all this?What is it to you what I do or don't do?Can it be you are come from Mary Leavenworth to see how I
am fulfilling her commands, and----"

"Mrs.Belden," I said, "it is of small importance now as to who I am, or
for what purpose I am here.But that my words may have the more effect,
I will say, that whereas I have not deceived you, either as to my name
or position, it is true that I am the friend of the Misses Leavenworth,
and that anything which is likely to affect them, is of interest to
me.When, therefore, I say that Eleanore Leavenworth is irretrievably
injured by this girl's death----"

"Death?The burst was too natural, the tone too horror-stricken for me to doubt
for another moment as to this woman's ignorance of the true state of
affairs."Yes," I repeated, "the girl you have been hiding so long and so well is
now beyond your control.I shall never lose from my ears the shriek which she uttered, nor the
wild, "I don't believe it!with which she dashed
from the room and rushed up-stairs.Nor that after-scene when, in the presence of the dead, she stood
wringing her hands and protesting, amid sobs of the sincerest grief and
terror, that she knew nothing of it; that she had left the girl in the
best of spirits the night before; that it was true she had locked her
in, but this she always did when any one was in the house; and that if
she died of any sudden attack, it must have been quietly, for she had
heard no stir all night, though she had listened more than once, being
naturally anxious lest the girl should make some disturbance that would
arouse me.I was in a hurry, and thought she was asleep;
so I set the things down where she could get them and came right away,
locking the door as usual.""It is strange she should have died this night of all others."No, sir; she was even brighter than common; more lively.I never
thought of her being sick then or ever.If I had----"

"You never thought of her being sick?""Why,
then, did you take such pains to give her a dose of medicine last
night?"she protested, evidently under the supposition it was I who
had spoken."Did I, Hannah, did I, poor girl?"stroking the hand that
lay in hers with what appeared to be genuine sorrow and regret.Where she did she get it if you didn't give
it to her?"This time she seemed to be aware that some one besides myself was
talking to her, for, hurriedly rising, she looked at the man with a
wondering stare, before replying."I don't know who you are, sir; but I can tell you this, the girl had no
medicine,--took no dose; she wasn't sick last night that I know of.""Saw her!--the world is crazy, or I am--saw her swallow a powder!How
could you see her do that or anything else?Hasn't she been shut up in
this room for twenty-four hours?""Yes; but with a window like that in the roof, it isn't so very
difficult to see into the room, madam.""Oh," she cried, shrinking, "I have a spy in the house, have I?But I
deserve it; I kept her imprisoned in four close walls, and never came
to look at her once all night.I don't complain; but what was it you say
you saw her take?You think she has poisoned herself, and that I had a
hand in it!""No," I hastened to remark, "he does not think you had a hand in it.He
says he saw the girl herself swallow something which he believes to have
been the occasion of her death, and only asks you now where she obtained
it."I never gave her anything; didn't know she had
anything."Somehow, I believed her, and so felt unwilling to prolong the present
interview, especially as each moment delayed the action which I felt it
incumbent upon us to take.So, motioning Q to depart upon his errand, I
took Mrs.Belden by the hand and endeavored to lead her from the
room.But she resisted, sitting down by the side of the bed with the
expression, "I will not leave her again; do not ask it; here is my
place, and here I will stay," while Q, obdurate for the first time,
stood staring severely upon us both, and would not move, though I urged
him again to make haste, saying that the morning was slipping away, and
that the telegram to Mr."Till that woman leaves the room, I don't; and unless you promise to
take my place in watching her, I don't quit the house."Astonished, I left her side and crossed to him."You carry your suspicions too far," I whispered, "and I think you are
too rude.We have seen nothing, I am sure, to warrant us in any such
action; besides, she can do no harm here; though, as for watching her, I
promise to do that much if it will relieve your mind.""I don't want her watched here; take her below."Are you not assuming a trifle the master?"If I am, it is because I have something in my
possession which excuses my conduct."Agitated now in my turn, I held out my hand."Not while that woman remains in the room."Seeing him implacable, I returned to Mrs."I must entreat you to come with me," said I."This is not a common
death; we shall be obliged to have the coroner here and others.You had
better leave the room and go below.""I don't mind the coroner; he is a neighbor of mine; his coming won't
prevent my watching over the poor girl until he arrives."Belden," I said, "your position as the only one conscious of the
presence of this girl in your house makes it wiser for you not to invite
suspicion by lingering any longer than is necessary in the room where
her dead body lies.""As if my neglect of her now were the best surety of my good intentions
towards her in time past!""It will not be neglect for you to go below with me at my earnest
request.You can do no good here by staying; will, in fact, be doing
harm.So listen to me or I shall be obliged to leave you in charge of
this man and go myself to inform the authorities."This last argument seemed to affect her, for with one look of shuddering
abhorrence at Q she rose, saying, "You have me in your power," and then,
without another word, threw her handkerchief over the girl's face and
left the room.In two minutes more I had the letter of which Q had
spoken in my hands."It is the only one I could find, sir.It was in the pocket of the dress
Mrs.The other must be lying around somewhere,
but I haven't had time to find it.Scarcely noticing at the time with what deep significance he spoke, I
opened the letter.It was the smaller of the two I had seen her draw
under her shawl the day before at the post-office, and read as follows:


    "DEAR, DEAR FRIEND:

    "I am in awful trouble.I cannot
    explain, I can only make one prayer.Destroy what you have,
    to-day, instantly, without question or hesitation.The consent
    of any one else has nothing to do with it.I am
    lost if you refuse.Do then what I ask, and save

    "ONE WHO LOVES YOU."Belden; there was no signature or date,
only the postmark New York; but I knew the handwriting.came in the dry tones which Q seemed to think fit to
adopt on this occasion."And a damning bit of evidence against the one
who wrote it, and the woman who received it!""A terrible piece of evidence, indeed," said I, "if I did not happen to
know that this letter refers to the destruction of something radically
different from what you suspect."Quite; but we will talk of this hereafter.It is time you sent your
telegram, and went for the coroner."And with this we parted; he to perform his role and I
mine.Belden walking the floor below, bewailing her situation,
and uttering wild sentences as to what the neighbors would say of her;
what the minister would think; what Clara, whoever that was, would do,
and how she wished she had died before ever she had meddled with the
affair.Succeeding in calming her after a while, I induced her to sit down and
listen to what I had to say."You will only injure yourself by this
display of feeling," I remarked, "besides unfitting yourself for what
you will presently be called upon to go through."And, laying myself out
to comfort the unhappy woman, I first explained the necessities of the
case, and next inquired if she had no friend upon whom she could call in
this emergency.To my great surprise she replied no; that while she had kind neighbors
and good friends, there was no one upon whom she could call in a case
like this, either for assistance or sympathy, and that, unless I would
take pity on her, she would have to meet it alone--"As I have met
everything," she said, "from Mr.Belden's death to the loss of most of
my little savings in a town fire last year."I was touched by this,--that she who, in spite of her weakness and
inconsistencies of character, possessed at least the one virtue of
sympathy with her kind, should feel any lack of friends.Unhesitatingly,
I offered to do what I could for her, providing she would treat me with
the perfect frankness which the case demanded.To my great relief, she
expressed not only her willingness, but her strong desire, to tell all
she knew."I have had enough secrecy for my whole life," she said.And indeed I do believe she was so thoroughly frightened, that if a
police-officer had come into the house and asked her to reveal secrets
compromising the good name of her own son, she would have done so
without cavil or question."I feel as if I wanted to take my stand out
on the common, and, in the face of the whole world, declare what I have
done for Mary Leavenworth.But first," she whispered, "tell me, for
God's sake, how those girls are situated.I have not dared to ask or
write.The papers say a good deal about Eleanore, but nothing about
Mary; and yet Mary writes of her own peril only, and of the danger she
would be in if certain facts were known.I don't want
to injure them, only to take care of myself."Belden," I said, "Eleanore Leavenworth has got into her
present difficulty by not telling all that was required of her.Mary
Leavenworth--but I cannot speak of her till I know what you have to
divulge.Her position, as well as that of her cousin, is too anomalous
for either you or me to discuss.What we want to learn from you is, how
you became connected with this affair, and what it was that Hannah knew
which caused her to leave New York and take refuge here."Belden, clasping and unclasping her hands, met my gaze with one
full of the most apprehensive doubt."You will never believe me," she
cried; "but I don't know what Hannah knew.I am in utter ignorance of
what she saw or heard on that fatal night; she never told, and I never
asked.She merely said that Miss Leavenworth wished me to secrete her
for a short time; and I, because I loved Mary Leavenworth and admired
her beyond any one I ever saw, weakly consented, and----"

"Do you mean to say," I interrupted, "that after you knew of the murder,
you, at the mere expression of Miss Leavenworth's wishes, continued to
keep this girl concealed without asking her any questions or demanding
any explanations?""Yes, sir; you will never believe me, but it is so.I thought that,
since Mary had sent her here, she must have her reasons; and--and--I
cannot explain it now; it all looks so differently; but I did do as I
have said."You must have had strong reason for
obeying Mary Leavenworth so blindly.""Oh, sir," she gasped, "I thought I understood it all; that Mary, the
bright young creature, who had stooped from her lofty position to make
use of me and to love me, was in some way linked to the criminal, and
that it would be better for me to remain in ignorance, do as I was
bid, and trust all would come right.I did not reason about it; I only
followed my impulse.I couldn't do otherwise; it isn't my nature.When I
am requested to do anything for a person I love, I cannot refuse.""And you love Mary Leavenworth; a woman whom you yourself seem to
consider capable of a great crime?""Oh, I didn't say that; I don't know as I thought that.She might be in
some way connected with it, without being the actual perpetrator.She
could never be that; she is too dainty."Belden," I said, "what do you know of Mary Leavenworth which makes
even that supposition possible?"The white face of the woman before me flushed."I scarcely know what to
reply," she cried."It is a long story, and----"

"Never mind the long story," I interrupted."Let me hear the one vital
reason.""Well," said she, "it is this; that Mary was in an emergency from which
nothing but her uncle's death could release her."But here we were interrupted by the sound of steps on the porch, and,
looking out, I saw Q entering the house alone.Belden where
she was, I stepped into the hall."Well," said I, "what is the matter?"No, gone away; off in a buggy to look after a man that was found some
ten miles from here, lying in a ditch beside a yoke of oxen."Then, as
he saw my look of relief, for I was glad of this temporary delay, said,
with an expressive wink: "It would take a fellow a long time to go to
him--if he wasn't in a hurry--hours, I think.""Very; no horse I could get could travel it faster than a walk.""Well," said I, "so much the better for us.Belden has a long story
to tell, and----"

"Doesn't wish to be interrupted."Yes, sir; if he has to hobble on two sticks.""At what time do you look for him?""_You_ will look for him as early as three o'clock.I shall be among the
mountains, ruefully eying my broken-down team."And leisurely donning
his hat he strolled away down the street like one who has the whole day
on his hands and does not know what to do with it.Belden's story, she at once
composed herself to the task, with the following result.BELDEN'S NARRATIVE


    "Cursed, destructive Avarice,
     Thou everlasting foe to Love and Honor.""Mischief never thrives
     Without the help of Woman."IT will be a year next July since I first saw Mary Leavenworth.I
was living at that time a most monotonous existence.Loving what was
beautiful, hating what was sordid, drawn by nature towards all that
was romantic and uncommon, but doomed by my straitened position and the
loneliness of my widowhood to spend my days in the weary round of plain
sewing, I had begun to think that the shadow of a humdrum old age
was settling down upon me, when one morning, in the full tide of my
dissatisfaction, Mary Leavenworth stepped across the threshold of my
door and, with one smile, changed the whole tenor of my life.This may seem exaggeration to you, especially when I say that her errand
was simply one of business, she having heard I was handy with my needle;
but if you could have seen her as she appeared that day, marked the look
with which she approached me, and the smile with which she left, you
would pardon the folly of a romantic old woman, who beheld a fairy queen
in this lovely young lady.The fact is, I was dazzled by her beauty and
her charms.And when, a few days after, she came again, and crouching
down on the stool at my feet, said she was so tired of the gossip and
tumult down at the hotel, that it was a relief to run away and hide with
some one who would let her act like the child she was, I experienced
for the moment, I believe, the truest happiness of my life.Meeting her
advances with all the warmth her manner invited, I found her ere long
listening eagerly while I told her, almost without my own volition, the
story of my past life, in the form of an amusing allegory.The next day saw her in the same place; and the next; always with the
eager, laughing eyes, and the fluttering, uneasy hands, that grasped
everything they touched, and broke everything they grasped.But the fourth day she was not there, nor the fifth, nor the sixth, and
I was beginning to feel the old shadow settling back upon me, when one
night, just as the dusk of twilight was merging into evening gloom, she
came stealing in at the front door, and, creeping up to my side, put her
hands over my eyes with such a low, ringing laugh, that I started."You don't know what to make of me!"she cried, throwing aside her
cloak, and revealing herself in the full splendor of evening attire."I
don't know what to make of myself.Though it seems folly, I felt that
I must run away and tell some one that a certain pair of eyes have been
looking into mine, and that for the first time in my life I feel
myself a woman as well as a queen."And with a glance in which coyness
struggled with pride, she gathered up her cloak around her, and
laughingly cried:

"Have you had a visit from a flying sprite?Has one little ray of
moonlight found its way into your prison for a wee moment, with Mary's
laugh and Mary's snowy silk and flashing diamonds?and she patted
my cheek, and smiled so bewilderingly, that even now, with all the
dull horror of these after-events crowding upon me, I cannot but feel
something like tears spring to my eyes at the thought of it."And so the Prince has come for you?"I whispered, alluding to a story I
had told her the last time she had visited me; a story in which a girl,
who had waited all her life in rags and degradation for the lordly
knight who was to raise her from a hovel to a throne, died just as her
one lover, an honest peasant-lad whom she had discarded in her pride,
arrived at her door with the fortune he had spent all his days in
amassing for her sake.But at this she flushed, and drew back towards the door."I don't know;
I am afraid not.I--I don't think anything about that.Princes are not
so easily won," she murmured.But she only shook her fairy head, and replied: "No, no; that would be
spoiling the romance, indeed.I have come upon you like a sprite, and
like a sprite I will go."And, flashing like the moonbeam she was, she
glided out into the night, and floated away down the street.When she next came, I observed a feverish excitement in her manner,
which assured me, even plainer than the coy sweetness displayed in
our last interview, that her heart had been touched by her lover's
attentions.Indeed, she hinted as much before she left, saying in a
melancholy tone, when I had ended my story in the usual happy way, with
kisses and marriage, "I shall never marry!"finishing the exclamation
with a long-drawn sigh, that somehow emboldened me to say, perhaps
because I knew she had no mother:

"And why?What reason can there be for such rosy lips saying their
possessor will never marry?"She gave me one quick look, and then dropped her eyes.I feared I had
offended her, and was feeling very humble, when she suddenly replied, in
an even but low tone, "I said I should never marry, because the one man
who pleases me can never be my husband."All the hidden romance in my nature started at once into life."There is nothing to tell," said she; "only I have been so weak as
to"--she would not say, fall in love, she was a proud woman--"admire a
man whom my uncle will never allow me to marry."And she rose as if to go; but I drew her back."Whom your uncle will not
allow you to marry!""No; uncle loves money, but not to such an extent as that.He is the owner of a beautiful place in his own
country----"

"Own country?""No," she returned; "he is an Englishman."I did not see why she need say that in just the way she did, but,
supposing she was aggravated by some secret memory, went on to inquire:
"Then what difficulty can there be?Isn't he--" I was going to say
steady, but refrained."He is an Englishman," she emphasized in the same bitter tone as
before."In saying that, I say it all.Uncle will never let me marry an
Englishman."Such a puerile reason as this had never
entered my mind."He has an absolute mania on the subject," resumed she."I might as well
ask him to allow me to drown myself as to marry an Englishman."A woman of truer judgment than myself would have said: "Then, if that is
so, why not discard from your breast all thought of him?Why dance with
him, and talk to him, and let your admiration develop into love?"But
I was all romance then, and, angry at a prejudice I could neither
understand nor appreciate, I said:

"But that is mere tyranny!And why,
if he does, should you feel yourself obliged to gratify him in a whim so
unreasonable?""Yes," I returned; "tell me everything.""Well, then, if you want to know the worst of me, as you already know
the best, I hate to incur my uncle's displeasure, because--because--I
have always been brought up to regard myself as his heiress, and I
know that if I were to marry contrary to his wishes, he would instantly
change his mind, and leave me penniless.""But," I cried, my romance a little dampened by this admission, "you
tell me Mr.Clavering has enough to live upon, so you would not want;
and if you love--"

Her violet eyes fairly flashed in her amazement."You don't understand," she said; "Mr.Clavering is not poor; but uncle
is rich.I shall be a queen--" There she paused, trembling, and falling
on my breast."Oh, it sounds mercenary, I know, but it is the fault of
my bringing up.And yet"--her whole face softening with the light of
another emotion, "I cannot say to Henry Clavering, 'Go!my prospects are
dearer to me than you!'said I, determined to get at the truth of the
matter if possible.If you knew me, you
would say it was."And, turning, she took her stand before a picture
that hung on the wall of my sitting-room.It was one of a pair of good photographs I possessed."Yes," I remarked, "that is why I prize it."She did not seem to hear me; she was absorbed in gazing at the exquisite
face before her."That is a winning face," I heard her say.I wonder if she would ever hesitate between love and money.I
do not believe she would," her own countenance growing gloomy and sad
as she said so; "she would think only of the happiness she would confer;
she is not hard like me.I think she had forgotten my presence, for at the mention of her
cousin's name she turned quickly round with a half suspicious look,
saying lightly:

"My dear old Mamma Hubbard looks horrified.She did not know she had
such a very unromantic little wretch for a listener, when she was
telling all those wonderful stories of Love slaying dragons, and living
in caves, and walking over burning ploughshares as if they were tufts of
spring grass?""No," I said, taking her with an irresistible impulse of admiring
affection into my arms; "but if I had, it would have made no difference.I should still have talked about love, and of all it can do to make this
weary workaday world sweet and delightful."Then you do not think me such a wretch?"I thought her the winsomest being in the world, and
frankly told her so.Instantly she brightened into her very gayest self.Not that I thought then, much less do I think now, she partially
cared for my good opinion; but her nature demanded admiration, and
unconsciously blossomed under it, as a flower under the sunshine."And you will still let me come and tell you how bad I am,--that is, if
I go on being bad, as I doubtless shall to the end of the chapter?"Not if I should do a dreadful thing?Not if I should run away with my
lover some fine night, and leave uncle to discover how his affectionate
partiality had been requited?"It was lightly said, and lightly meant, for she did not even wait for my
reply.But its seed sank deep into our two hearts for all that.And for
the next few days I spent my time in planning how I should manage, if
it should ever fall to my lot to conduct to a successful issue so
enthralling a piece of business as an elopement.You may imagine, then,
how delighted I was, when one evening Hannah, this unhappy girl who
is now lying dead under my roof, and who was occupying the position of
lady's maid to Miss Mary Leavenworth at that time, came to my door with
a note from her mistress, running thus:


    "Have the loveliest story of the season ready for me tomorrow; and
    let the prince be as handsome as--as some one you have heard of,
    and the princess as foolish as your little yielding pet,

    "MARY."Which short note could only mean that she was engaged.But the next day
did not bring me my Mary, nor the next, nor the next; and beyond hearing
that Mr.Leavenworth had returned from his trip I received neither word
nor token.Two more days dragged by, when, just as twilight set in, she
came.It had been a week since I had seen her, but it might have been
a year from the change I observed in her countenance and expression.I
could scarcely greet her with any show of pleasure, she was so unlike
her former self."You
expected revelations, whispered hopes, and all manner of sweet
confidences; and you see, instead, a cold, bitter woman, who for
the first time in your presence feels inclined to be reserved and
uncommunicative.""That is because you have had more to trouble than encourage you in your
love," I returned, though not without a certain shrinking, caused more
by her manner than words.She did not reply to this, but rose and paced the floor, coldly at
first, but afterwards with a certain degree of excitement that proved
to be the prelude to a change in her manner; for, suddenly pausing, she
turned to me and said: "Mr."Yes, my uncle commanded me to dismiss him, and I obeyed."The work dropped from my hands, in my heartfelt disappointment."Yes; he had not been in the house five minutes before Eleanore told
him."I was foolish enough
to give her the cue in my first moment of joy and weakness.I did
not think of the consequences; but I might have known."I do not call it conscientiousness to tell another's secrets," I
returned."That is because you are not Eleanore."Not having a reply for this, I said, "And so your uncle did not regard
your engagement with favor?"Did I not tell you he would never allow me to marry an
Englishman?Let the hard, cruel man have his
way?"She was walking off to look again at that picture which had attracted
her attention the time before, but at this word gave me one little
sidelong look that was inexpressibly suggestive."I obeyed him when he commanded, if that is what you mean."Clavering after having given him your word of honor
to be his wife?""Why not, when I found I could not keep my word.""Then you have decided not to marry him?"She did not reply at once, but lifted her face mechanically to the
picture."My uncle would tell you that I had decided to be governed wholly by
his wishes!"she responded at last with what I felt was self-scornful
bitterness.and instantly blushed, startled that I had called her by her
first name."Is it not my manifest
duty to be governed by my uncle's wishes?Has he not brought me up from
childhood?made me all I am, even to the
love of riches which he has instilled into my soul with every gift he
has thrown into my lap, every word he has dropped into my ear, since I
was old enough to know what riches meant?Is it for me now to turn my
back upon fostering care so wise, beneficent, and free, just because
a man whom I have known some two weeks chances to offer me in exchange
what he pleases to call his love?""But," I feebly essayed, convinced perhaps by the tone of sarcasm in
which this was uttered that she was not far from my way of thinking
after all, "if in two weeks you have learned to love this man more than
everything else, even the riches which make your uncle's favor a thing
of such moment--"

"Well," said she, "what then?""Why, then I would say, secure your happiness with the man of your
choice, if you have to marry him in secret, trusting to your influence
over your uncle to win the forgiveness he never can persistently deny."You should have seen the arch expression which stole across her face
at that."Would it not be better," she asked, creeping to my arms, and
laying her head on my shoulder, "would it not be better for me to make
sure of that uncle's favor first, before undertaking the hazardous
experiment of running away with a too ardent lover?"Struck by her manner, I lifted her face and looked at it."Oh, my darling," said I, "you have not, then dismissed Mr."I have sent him away," she whispered demurely."Oh, you dear old Mamma Hubbard; what a matchmaker you are, to be sure!You appear as much interested as if you were the lover yourself.""He will wait for me," said she.The next day I submitted to her the plan I had formed for her
clandestine intercourse with Mr.It was for them both to
assume names, she taking mine, as one less liable to provoke conjecture
than a strange name, and he that of LeRoy Robbins.The plan pleased
her, and with the slight modification of a secret sign being used on the
envelope, to distinguish her letters from mine, was at once adopted.And so it was I took the fatal step that has involved me in all this
trouble.With the gift of my name to this young girl to use as she
would and sign what she would, I seemed to part with what was left me of
judgment and discretion.Henceforth, I was only her scheming, planning,
devoted slave; now copying the letters which she brought me, and
enclosing them to the false name we had agreed upon, and now busying
myself in devising ways to forward to her those which I received from
him, without risk of discovery.Hannah was the medium we employed, as
Mary felt it would not be wise for her to come too often to my house.To this girl's charge, then, I gave such notes as I could not forward in
any other way, secure in the reticence of her nature, as well as in her
inability to read, that these letters addressed to Mrs.Amy Belden would
arrive at their proper destination without mishap.At all events, no difficulty that I ever heard of arose out
of the use of this girl as a go-between.Clavering, who had left an invalid mother
in England, was suddenly summoned home.He prepared to go, but, flushed
with love, distracted by doubts, smitten with the fear that, once
withdrawn from the neighborhood of a woman so universally courted as
Mary, he would stand small chance of retaining his position in her
regard, he wrote to her, telling his fears and asking her to marry him
before he went."Make me your husband, and I will follow your wishes in all things,"
he wrote."The certainty that you are mine will make parting possible;
without it, I cannot go; no, not if my mother should die without the
comfort of saying good-bye to her only child."By some chance she was in my house when I brought this letter from the
post-office, and I shall never forget how she started when she read it.But, from looking as if she had received an insult, she speedily settled
down into a calm consideration of the subject, writing and delivering
into my charge for copying a few lines in which she promised to accede
to his request, if he would agree to leave the public declaration of the
marriage to her discretion, and consent to bid her farewell at the door
of the church or wherever the ceremony of marriage should take place,
never to come into her presence again till such declaration had been
made.Of course this brought in a couple of days the sure response:
"Anything, so you will be mine."And Amy Belden's wits and powers of planning were all summoned into
requisition for the second time, to devise how this matter could be
arranged without subjecting the parties to the chance of detection.In the first place, it was essential
that the marriage should come off within three days, Mr.Clavering
having, upon the receipt of her letter, secured his passage upon a
steamer that sailed on the following Saturday; and, next, both he and
Miss Leavenworth were too conspicuous in their personal appearance to
make it at all possible for them to be secretly married anywhere within
gossiping distance of this place.And yet it was desirable that the
scene of the ceremony should not be too far away, or the time occupied
in effecting the journey to and from the place would necessitate an
absence from the hotel on the part of Miss Leavenworth long enough to
arouse the suspicions of Eleanore; something which Mary felt it wiser
to avoid.Her uncle, I have forgotten to say, was not here--having gone
away again shortly after the apparent dismissal of Mr.F----, then, was the only town I could think of which combined the two
advantages of distance and accessibility.Although upon the railroad, it
was an insignificant place, and had, what was better yet, a very obscure
man for its clergyman, living, which was best of all, not ten rods from
the depot.Making inquiries, I found that it
could be done, and, all alive to the romance of the occasion, proceeded
to plan the details.And now I am coming to what might have caused the overthrow of the
whole scheme: I allude to the detection on the part of Eleanore of the
correspondence between Mary and Mr.Hannah,
who, in her frequent visits to my house, had grown very fond of my
society, had come in to sit with me for a while one evening.She had not
been in the house, however, more than ten minutes, before there came a
knock at the front door; and going to it I saw Mary, as I supposed, from
the long cloak she wore, standing before me.Thinking she had come with
a letter for Mr.Clavering, I grasped her arm and drew her into the
hall, saying, "Have you got it?I must post it to-night, or he will not
receive it in time."There I paused, for, the panting creature I had by the arm turning upon
me, I saw myself confronted by a stranger."You have made a mistake," she cried."I am Eleanore Leavenworth, and I
have come for my girl Hannah.I could only raise my hand in apprehension, and point to the girl
sitting in the corner of the room before her.Miss Leavenworth
immediately turned back."Hannah, I want you," said she, and would have left the house without
another word, but I caught her by the arm."Oh, miss--" I began, but she gave me such a look, I dropped her arm.And, with a glance to see if Hannah were following her,
she went out.For an hour I sat crouched on the stair just where she had left me.Then
I went to bed, but I did not sleep a wink that night.You can imagine,
then, my wonder when, with the first glow of the early morning light,
Mary, looking more beautiful than ever, came running up the steps and
into the room where I was, with the letter for Mr.I cried in my joy and relief, "didn't she understand me, then?"The gay look on Mary's face turned to one of reckless scorn."If you
mean Eleanore, yes.I couldn't keep it secret after the
mistake you made last evening; so I did the next best thing, told her
the truth.""Not that you were about to be married?""And you did not find her as angry as you expected?""I will not say that; she was angry enough.And yet," continued Mary,
with a burst of self-scornful penitence, "I will not call Eleanore's
lofty indignation anger.She was grieved, Mamma Hubbard, grieved."And
with a laugh which I believe was rather the result of her own relief
than of any wish to reflect on her cousin, she threw her head on one
side and eyed me with a look which seemed to say, "Do I plague you so
very much, you dear old Mamma Hubbard?"She did plague me, and I could not conceal it."And will she not tell
her uncle?"The naive expression on Mary's face quickly changed.I felt a heavy hand, hot with fever, lifted from my heart.The plan agreed upon between us for the carrying out of our intentions
was this.At the time appointed, Mary was to excuse herself to her
cousin upon the plea that she had promised to take me to see a friend
in the next town.She was then to enter a buggy previously ordered, and
drive here, where I was to join her.We were then to proceed immediately
to the minister's house in F----, where we had reason to believe we
should find everything prepared for us.But in this plan, simple as it
was, one thing was forgotten, and that was the character of Eleanore's
love for her cousin.That her suspicions would be aroused we did
not doubt; but that she would actually follow Mary up and demand an
explanation of her conduct, was what neither she, who knew her so well,
nor I, who knew her so little, ever imagined possible.Mary, who had followed out the
programme to the point of leaving a little note of excuse on Eleanore's
dressing-table, had come to my house, and was just taking off her long
cloak to show me her dress, when there came a commanding knock at
the front door.Hastily pulling her cloak about her I ran to open it,
intending, you may be sure, to dismiss my visitor with short ceremony,
when I heard a voice behind me say, "Good heavens, it is Eleanore!"and,
glancing back, saw Mary looking through the window-blind upon the porch
without.why, open the door and let her in; I am not afraid of Eleanore."I immediately did so, and Eleanore Leavenworth, very pale, but with
a resolute countenance, walked into the house and into this room,
confronting Mary in very nearly the same spot where you are now sitting."I have come," said she, lifting a face whose expression of mingled
sweetness and power I could not but admire, even in that moment of
apprehension, "to ask you without any excuse for my request, if you will
allow me to accompany you upon your drive this morning?"Mary, who had drawn herself up to meet some word of accusation or
appeal, turned carelessly away to the glass."I am very sorry," she
said, "but the buggy holds only two, and I shall be obliged to refuse.""But I do not wish your company, Eleanore.We are off on a pleasure
trip, and desire to have our fun by ourselves.""And you will not allow me to accompany you?""I cannot prevent your going in another carriage."Eleanore's face grew yet more earnest in its expression."Mary," said
she, "we have been brought up together.I am your sister in affection
if not in blood, and I cannot see you start upon this adventure with no
other companion than this woman.Then tell me, shall I go with you, as a
sister, or on the road behind you as the enforced guardian of your honor
against your will?""Now is it discreet or honorable in you to do this?"Mary's haughty lip took an ominous curve."The same hand that raised you
has raised me," she cried bitterly."This is no time to speak of that," returned Eleanore.All the antagonism of her nature was
aroused.She looked absolutely Juno-like in her wrath and reckless
menace."Eleanore," she cried, "I am going to F---- to marry Mr._Now_ do you wish to accompany me?"Leaping forward, she grasped her cousin's
arm and shook it."To witness the marriage, if it be a true one; to step between you
and shame if any element of falsehood should come in to affect its
legality."Mary's hand fell from her cousin's arm."I do not understand you,"
said she."I thought you never gave countenance to what you considered
wrong.""Nor do I. Any one who knows me will understand that I do not give my
approval to this marriage just because I attend its ceremonial in the
capacity of an unwilling witness.""Because I value your honor above my own peace.Because I love our
common benefactor, and know that he would never pardon me if I let his
darling be married, however contrary her union might be to his wishes,
without lending the support of my presence to make the transaction at
least a respectable one.""But in so doing you will be involved in a world of deception--which you
hate."Clavering does not return with me, Eleanore."Mary's face crimsoned, and she turned slowly away."What every other girl does under such circumstances, I suppose.The
development of more reasonable feelings in an obdurate parent's heart."Eleanore sighed, and a short silence ensued, broken by Eleanore's
suddenly falling upon her knees, and clasping her cousin's hand."Oh,
Mary," she sobbed, her haughtiness all disappearing in a gush of wild
entreaty, "consider what you are doing!Think, before it is too late, of
the consequences which must follow such an act as this.Marriage founded
upon deception can never lead to happiness.Love would have led you either to have dismissed Mr.Clavering at once,
or to have openly accepted the fate which a union with him would bring.Only passion stoops to subterfuge like this.And you," she continued,
rising and turning toward me in a sort of forlorn hope very touching
to see, "can you see this young motherless girl, driven by caprice, and
acknowledging no moral restraint, enter upon the dark and crooked path
she is planning for herself, without uttering one word of warning and
appeal?Tell me, mother of children dead and buried, what excuse you
will have for your own part in this day's work, when she, with her
face marred by the sorrows which must follow this deception, comes to
you----"

"The same excuse, probably," Mary's voice broke in, chill and strained,
"which you will have when uncle inquires how you came to allow such an
act of disobedience to be perpetrated in his absence: that she could not
help herself, that Mary would gang her ain gait, and every one around
must accommodate themselves to it."It was like a draught of icy air suddenly poured into a room heated up
to fever point.Eleanore stiffened immediately, and drawing back, pale
and composed, turned upon her cousin with the remark:

"Then nothing can move you?"The curling of Mary's lips was her only reply.Raymond, I do not wish to weary you with my feelings, but the first
great distrust I ever felt of my wisdom in pushing this matter so far
came with that curl of Mary's lip.More plainly than Eleanore's words it
showed me the temper with which she was entering upon this undertaking;
and, struck with momentary dismay, I advanced to speak when Mary stopped
me."There, now, Mamma Hubbard, don't you go and acknowledge that you
are frightened, for I won't hear it.I have promised to marry Henry
Clavering to-day, and I am going to keep my word--if I don't love him,"
she added with bitter emphasis.Then, smiling upon me in a way which
caused me to forget everything save the fact that she was going to her
bridal, she handed me her veil to fasten.As I was doing this, with very
trembling fingers, she said, looking straight at Eleanore:

"You have shown yourself more interested in my fate than I had any
reason to expect.Will you continue to display this concern all the way
to F----, or may I hope for a few moments of peace in which to dream
upon the step which, according to you, is about to hurl upon me such
dreadful consequences?""If I go with you to F----," Eleanore returned, "it is as a witness, no
more."Very well, then," Mary said, dimpling with sudden gayety; "I suppose
I shall have to accept the situation.Mamma Hubbard, I am so sorry to
disappoint you, but the buggy _won't_ hold three.If you are good you
shall be the first to congratulate me when I come home to-night."And,
almost before I knew it, the two had taken their seats in the buggy that
was waiting at the door."Good-by," cried Mary, waving her hand from the
back; "wish me much joy--of my ride."I tried to do so, but the words wouldn't come.I could only wave my hand
in response, and rush sobbing into the house.Of that day, and its long hours of alternate remorse and anxiety, I
cannot trust myself to speak.Let me come at once to the time when,
seated alone in my lamp-lighted room, I waited and watched for the token
of their return which Mary had promised me.It came in the shape of Mary
herself, who, wrapped in her long cloak, and with her beautiful face
aglow with blushes, came stealing into the house just as I was beginning
to despair.A strain of wild music from the hotel porch, where they were having a
dance, entered with her, producing such a weird effect upon my fancy
that I was not at all surprised when, in flinging off her cloak, she
displayed garments of bridal white and a head crowned with snowy roses.I cried, bursting into tears; "you are then----"

"Mrs."Without a bridal," I murmured, taking her passionately into my embrace.Nestling close to me, she gave
herself up for one wild moment to a genuine burst of tears, saying
between her sobs all manner of tender things; telling me how she loved
me, and how I was the only one in all the world to whom she dared come
on this, her wedding night, for comfort or congratulation, and of how
frightened she felt now it was all over, as if with her name she had
parted with something of inestimable value."And does not the thought of having made some one the proudest of men
solace you?"I asked, more than dismayed at this failure of mine to make
these lovers happy."I don't know," she sobbed."What satisfaction can it be for him to
feel himself tied for life to a girl who, sooner than lose a prospective
fortune, subjected him to such a parting?""Tell me about it," said I.

But she was not in the mood at that moment.The excitement of the day
had been too much for her.A thousand fears seemed to beset her mind.Crouching down on the stool at my feet, she sat with her hands folded
and a glare on her face that lent an aspect of strange unreality to her
brilliant attire.The thought haunts me
every moment; how can I keep it secret!""Why, is there any danger of its being known?""It all went off well, but----"

"Where is the danger, then?""I cannot say; but some deeds are like ghosts.They will not be laid;
they reappear; they gibber; they make themselves known whether we will
or not.I was mad, reckless, what you
will.But ever since the night has come, I have felt it crushing upon me
like a pall that smothers life and youth and love out of my heart.While
the sunlight remained I could endure it; but now--oh, Auntie, I have
done something that will keep me in constant fear.I have allied myself
to a living apprehension."For two hours I have played at being gay.Dressed in my bridal white,
and crowned with roses, I have greeted my friends as if they were
wedding-guests, and made believe to myself that all the compliments
bestowed upon me--and they are only too numerous--were just so many
congratulations upon my marriage.But it was no use; Eleanore knew it
was no use.She has gone to her room to pray, while I--I have come here
for the first time, perhaps for the last, to fall at some one's feet and
cry,--' God have mercy upon me!'""Oh, Mary, have I only
succeeded, then, in making you miserable?"She did not answer; she was engaged in picking up the crown of roses
which had fallen from her hair to the floor."If I had not been taught to love money so!""If,
like Eleanore, I could look upon the splendor which has been ours from
childhood as a mere accessory of life, easy to be dropped at the call of
duty or affection!If prestige, adulation, and elegant belongings were
not so much to me; or love, friendship, and domestic happiness more!If only I could walk a step without dragging the chain of a thousand
luxurious longings after me.Imperious as she often is in
her beautiful womanhood, haughty as she can be when the delicate quick
of her personality is touched too rudely, I have known her to sit by the
hour in a low, chilly, ill-lighted and ill-smelling garret, cradling a
dirty child on her knee, and feeding with her own hand an impatient old
woman whom no one else would consent to touch.they talk about
repentance and a change of heart!If some one or something would only
change mine!no hope of my ever being
anything else than what I am: a selfish, wilful, mercenary girl."Nor was this mood a mere transitory one.That same night she made a
discovery which increased her apprehension almost to terror.This was
nothing less than the fact that Eleanore had been keeping a diary of
the last few weeks."Oh," she cried in relating this to me the next day,
"what security shall I ever feel as long as this diary of hers remains
to confront me every time I go into her room?And she will not consent
to destroy it, though I have done my best to show her that it is a
betrayal of the trust I reposed in her.She says it is all she has to
show in the way of defence, if uncle should ever accuse her of treachery
to him and his happiness.She promises to keep it locked up; but what
good will that do!A thousand accidents might happen, any of them
sufficient to throw it into uncle's hands.I shall never feel safe for a
moment while it exists."I endeavored to calm her by saying that if Eleanore was without malice,
such fears were groundless.But she would not be comforted, and seeing
her so wrought up, I suggested that Eleanore should be asked to trust it
into my keeping till such time as she should feel the necessity of using
it."O yes," she cried; "and I will
put my certificate with it, and so get rid of all my care at once."And before the afternoon was over, she had seen Eleanore and made her
request.It was acceded to with this proviso, that I was neither to destroy nor
give up all or any of the papers except upon their united demand.A
small tin box was accordingly procured, into which were put all the
proofs of Mary's marriage then existing, viz.Clavering's letters, and such leaves from Eleanore's diary as referred
to this matter.It was then handed over to me with the stipulation
I have already mentioned, and I stowed it away in a certain closet
upstairs, where it has lain undisturbed till last night.Belden paused, and, blushing painfully, raised her eyes to
mine with a look in which anxiety and entreaty were curiously blended."I don't know what you will say," she began, "but, led away by my
fears, I took that box out of its hiding-place last evening and,
notwithstanding your advice, carried it from the house, and it is
now----"

"In my possession," I quietly finished.I don't think I ever saw her look more astounded, not even when I told
her of Hannah's death."I left it last
night in the old barn that was burned down.I merely meant to hide it
for the present, and could think of no better place in my hurry; for the
barn is said to be haunted--a man hung himself there once--and no one
ever goes there.she cried, "unless----"

"Unless I found and brought it away before the barn was destroyed," I
suggested."Yes," said I. Then, as I felt my own countenance redden, hastened to
add: "We have been playing strange and unaccustomed parts, you and I.
Some time, when all these dreadful events shall be a mere dream of the
past, we will ask each other's pardon.The
box is safe, and I am anxious to hear the rest of your story."This seemed to compose her, and after a minute she continued:

Mary seemed more like herself after this.Leavenworth's return and their subsequent preparations for departure,
I saw but little more of her, what I did see was enough to make me
fear that, with the locking up of the proofs of her marriage, she was
indulging the idea that the marriage itself had become void.But I may
have wronged her in this.The story of those few weeks is almost finished.On the eve of the day
before she left, Mary came to my house to bid me good-by.She had a
present in her hand the value of which I will not state, as I did not
take it, though she coaxed me with all her prettiest wiles.But she said
something that night that I have never been able to forget.I had been speaking of my hope that before two months had elapsed she
would find herself in a position to send for Mr.Clavering, and that
when that day came I should wish to be advised of it; when she suddenly
interrupted me by saying:

"Uncle will never be won upon, as you call it, while he lives.If I was
convinced of it before, I am sure of it now.Nothing but his death will
ever make it possible for me to send for Mr.Then, seeing
me look aghast at the long period of separation which this seemed to
betoken, blushed a little and whispered: "The prospect looks somewhat
dubious, doesn't it?"But," said I, "your uncle is only little past the prime of life and
appears to be in robust health; it will be years of waiting, Mary.""I don't know," she muttered, "I think not.Uncle is not as strong as he
looks and--" She did not say any more, horrified perhaps at the turn the
conversation was taking.But there was an expression on her countenance
that set me thinking at the time, and has kept me thinking ever since.Not that any actual dread of such an occurrence as has since happened
came to oppress my solitude during the long months which now intervened.I was as yet too much under the spell of her charm to allow anything
calculated to throw a shadow over her image to remain long in my
thoughts.But when, some time in the fall, a letter came to me
personally from Mr.Clavering, filled with a vivid appeal to tell
him something of the woman who, in spite of her vows, doomed him to a
suspense so cruel, and when, on the evening of the same day, a friend
of mine who had just returned from New York spoke of meeting Mary
Leavenworth at some gathering, surrounded by manifest admirers, I began
to realize the alarming features of the affair, and, sitting down, I
wrote her a letter.Not in the strain in which I had been accustomed to
talk to her,--I had not her pleading eyes and trembling, caressing hands
ever before me to beguile my judgment from its proper exercise,--but
honestly and earnestly, telling her how Mr.Clavering felt, and what a
risk she ran in keeping so ardent a lover from his rights.Robbins out of my calculations for the present, and
advise you to do the same.As for the gentleman himself, I have told him
that when I could receive him I would be careful to notify him."But do not let him be discouraged," she added in a postscript."When he
does receive his happiness, it will be a satisfying one."Ah, it is that _when_ which is likely to ruin all!But, intent only upon fulfilling her will, I sat down and wrote a letter
to Mr.Clavering, in which I stated what she had said, and begged him
to have patience, adding that I would surely let him know if any change
took place in Mary or her circumstances.And, having despatched it to
his address in London, awaited the development of events.In two weeks I heard of the sudden
death of Mr.Stebbins, the minister who had married them; and while
yet laboring under the agitation produced by this shock, was further
startled by seeing in a New York paper the name of Mr.Clavering among
the list of arrivals at the Hoffman House; showing that my letter to
him had failed in its intended effect, and that the patience Mary had
calculated upon so blindly was verging to its end.I was consequently
far from being surprised when, in a couple of weeks or so afterwards,
a letter came from him to my address, which, owing to the careless
omission of the private mark upon the envelope, I opened, and read
enough to learn that, driven to desperation by the constant failures
which he had experienced in all his endeavors to gain access to her in
public or private, a failure which he was not backward in ascribing
to her indisposition to see him, he had made up his mind to risk
everything, even her displeasure; and, by making an appeal to her uncle,
end the suspense under which he was laboring, definitely and at once."I
want you," he wrote; "dowered or dowerless, it makes little difference
to me.If you will not come of yourself, then I must follow the example
of the brave knights, my ancestors; storm the castle that holds you, and
carry you off by force of arms."Neither can I say I was much surprised, knowing Mary as I did, when, in
a few days from this, she forwarded to me for copying, this reply: "If
Mr.Robbins ever expects to be happy with Amy Belden, let him reconsider
the determination of which he speaks.Not only would he by such an
action succeed in destroying the happiness of her he professes to love,
but run the greater risk of effectually annulling the affection which
makes the tie between them endurable."It was the cry of warning
which a spirited, self-contained creature gives when brought to bay.It
made even me recoil, though I had known from the first that her pretty
wilfulness was but the tossing foam floating above the soundless depths
of cold resolve and most deliberate purpose.What its real effect was upon him and her fate I can only conjecture.All I know is that in two weeks thereafter Mr.Leavenworth was found
murdered in his room, and Hannah Chester, coming direct to my door from
the scene of violence, begged me to take her in and secrete her from
public inquiry, as I loved and desired to serve Mary Leavenworth.UNEXPECTED TESTIMONY


    _Pol._ What do you read, my lord?BELDEN paused, lost in the sombre shadow which these words were
calculated to evoke, and a short silence fell upon the room.It was
broken by my asking for some account of the occurrence she had just
mentioned, it being considered a mystery how Hannah could have found
entrance into her house without the knowledge of the neighbors."Well," said she, "it was a chilly night, and I had gone to bed early
(I was sleeping then in the room off this) when, at about a quarter to
one--the last train goes through R---- at 12.50--there came a low knock
on the window-pane at the head of my bed.Thinking that some of the
neighbors were sick, I hurriedly rose on my elbow and asked who
was there.The answer came in low, muffled tones, 'Hannah, Miss
Leavenworth's girl!Startled at
hearing the well-known voice, and fearing I knew not what, I caught up
a lamp and hurried round to the door.But no sooner had she done so than
my strength failed me, and I had to sit down, for I saw she looked very
pale and strange, was without baggage, and altogether had the appearance
of some wandering spirit.what brings you here in this condition and at this time
of night?''Miss Leavenworth has sent me,' she replied, in the low,
monotonous tone of one repeating a lesson by rote.'She told me to come
here; said you would keep me.I am not to go out of the house, and no
one is to know I am here.'I asked, trembling with a thousand
undefined fears; 'what has occurred?''I dare not say,' she whispered;
'I am forbid; I am just to stay here, and keep quiet.''But,' I began,
helping her to take off her shawl,--the dingy blanket advertised for
in the papers--'you must tell me.She surely did not forbid you to tell
_me?_' 'Yes she did; every one,' the girl replied, growing white in her
persistence, 'and I never break my word; fire couldn't draw it out
of me.'She looked so determined, so utterly unlike herself, as I
remembered her in the meek, unobtrusive days of our old acquaintance,
that I could do nothing but stare at her.'You will keep me,' she said;
'you will not turn me away?''No,' I said, 'I will not turn you away.'Thanking me, she quietly followed me
up-stairs.I put her into the room in which you found her, because it
was the most secret one in the house; and there she has remained ever
since, satisfied and contented, as far as I could see, till this very
same horrible day.""Did you have no explanation with her
afterwards?Did she never give you any information in regard to the
transactions which led to her flight?"Neither then nor when,
upon the next day, I confronted her with the papers in my hand, and the
awful question upon my lips as to whether her flight had been occasioned
by the murder which had taken place in Mr.Leavenworth's household, did
she do more than acknowledge she had run away on this account.Some one
or something had sealed her lips, and, as she said, 'Fire and torture
should never make her speak.'"Another short pause followed this; then, with my mind still hovering
about the one point of intensest interest to me, I said:

"This story, then, this account which you have just given me of Mary
Leavenworth's secret marriage and the great strait it put her
into--a strait from which nothing but her uncle's death could relieve
her--together with this acknowledgment of Hannah's that she had left
home and taken refuge here on the insistence of Mary Leavenworth, is the
groundwork you have for the suspicions you have mentioned?""Yes, sir; that and the proof of her interest in the matter which is
given by the letter I received from her yesterday, and which you say you
have now in your possession."Belden went on in a broken voice, "that it is wrong, in a
serious case like this, to draw hasty conclusions; but, oh, sir, how can
I help it, knowing what I do?"I did not answer; I was revolving in my mind the old question: was it
possible, in face of all these later developments, still to believe Mary
Leavenworth's own hand guiltless of her uncle's blood?"It is dreadful to come to such conclusions," proceeded Mrs.Belden,
"and nothing but her own words written in her own hand would ever have
driven me to them, but----"

"Pardon me," I interrupted; "but you said in the beginning of this
interview that you did not believe Mary herself had any direct hand in
her uncle's murder.Whatever I may think of her influence in inducing
it, I never could imagine her as having anything to do with its actual
performance.whatever was done on that dreadful night,
Mary Leavenworth never put hand to pistol or ball, or even stood by
while they were used; that you may be sure of.Only the man who loved
her, longed for her, and felt the impossibility of obtaining her by any
other means, could have found nerve for an act so horrible.""Then you think----"

"Mr.I do: and oh, sir, when you consider that he
is her husband, is it not dreadful enough?""It is, indeed," said I, rising to conceal how much I was affected by
this conclusion of hers.Something in my tone or appearance seemed to startle her."I hope and
trust I have not been indiscreet," she cried, eying me with something
like an incipient distrust."With this dead girl lying in my house, I
ought to be very careful, I know, but----"

"You have said nothing," was my earnest assurance as I edged towards the
door in my anxiety to escape, if but for a moment, from an atmosphere
that was stifling me."No one can blame you for anything you have
either said or done to-day.But"--and here I paused and walked hurriedly
back,--"I wish to ask one question more.Have you any reason, beyond
that of natural repugnance to believing a young and beautiful woman
guilty of a great crime, for saying what you have of Henry Clavering, a
gentleman who has hitherto been mentioned by you with respect?""No," she whispered, with a touch of her old agitation.I felt the reason insufficient, and turned away with something of the
same sense of suffocation with which I had heard that the missing key
had been found in Eleanore Leavenworth's possession."You must excuse
me," I said; "I want to be a moment by myself, in order to ponder over
the facts which I have just heard; I will soon return "; and without
further ceremony, hurried from the room.By some indefinable impulse, I went immediately up-stairs, and took my
stand at the western window of the large room directly over Mrs.The blinds were closed; the room was shrouded in funereal gloom, but
its sombreness and horror were for the moment unfelt; I was engaged in
a fearful debate with myself.Was Mary Leavenworth the principal, or
merely the accessory, in this crime?Gryce, the convictions of Eleanore, the circumstantial evidence even of
such facts as had come to our knowledge, preclude the possibility
that Mrs.That all the detectives
interested in the affair would regard the question as settled, I did not
doubt; but need it be?Was it utterly impossible to find evidence yet
that Henry Clavering was, after all, the assassin of Mr.Filled with the thought, I looked across the room to the closet where
lay the body of the girl who, according to all probability, had known
the truth of the matter, and a great longing seized me.Oh, why could
not the dead be made to speak?Why should she lie there so silent, so
pulseless, so inert, when a word from her were enough to decide the
awful question?Was there no power to compel those pallid lips to move?Carried away by the fervor of the moment, I made my way to her side.With what a mockery the closed lips and lids confronted
my demanding gaze!A stone could not have been more unresponsive.With a feeling that was almost like anger, I stood there, when--what
was it I saw protruding from beneath her shoulders where they crushed
against the bed?Dizzy with the sudden surprise, overcome with the wild hopes this
discovery awakened, I stooped in great agitation and drew the letter
out.Breaking it hastily open, I took
a glance at its contents.it was the work of the girl
herself!--its very appearance was enough to make that evident!Feeling
as if a miracle had happened, I hastened with it into the other room,
and set myself to decipher the awkward scrawl.This is what I saw, rudely printed in lead pencil on the inside of a
sheet of common writing-paper:

"I am a wicked girl.I have knone things all the time which I had ought
to have told but I didn't dare to he said he would kill me if I did I
mene the tall splendud looking gentulman with the black mustash who I
met coming out of Mister Levenworth's room with a key in his hand the
night Mr.He was so scared he gave me money and
made me go away and come here and keep every thing secret but I can't do
so no longer.I seem to see Miss Elenor all the time crying and asking
me if I want her sent to prisun.And this is
the truth and my last words and I pray every body's forgivness and hope
nobody will blame me and that they wont bother Miss Elenor any more but
go and look after the handsome gentulman with the black mushtash."THE PROBLEM SOLVED



XXXIV.GRYCE RESUMES CONTROL


    "It out-herods Herod."--Richard III

A HALF-HOUR had passed.The train upon which I had every reason to
expect Mr.Gryce had arrived, and I stood in the doorway awaiting with
indescribable agitation the slow and labored approach of the motley
group of men and women whom I had observed leave the depot at the
departure of the cars.Was the telegram of a
nature peremptory enough to make his presence here, sick as he was, an
absolute certainty?The written confession of Hannah throbbing against
my heart, a heart all elation now, as but a short half-hour before it
had been all doubt and struggle, seemed to rustle distrust, and the
prospect of a long afternoon spent in impatience was rising before me,
when a portion of the advancing crowd turned off into a side street,
and I saw the form of Mr.Gryce hobbling, not on two sticks, but very
painfully on one, coming slowly down the street.His face, as he approached, was a study."Well, well, well," he exclaimed, as we met at the gate; "this is a
pretty how-dye-do, I must say.and everything turned
topsy-turvy!Humph, and what do you think of Mary Leavenworth now?"It would therefore seem natural, in the conversation which followed his
introduction into the house and installment in Mrs.Belden's parlor,
that I should begin my narration by showing him Hannah's confession; but
it was not so.Whether it was that I felt anxious to have him go through
the same alternations of hope and fear it had been my lot to experience
since I came to R----; or whether, in the depravity of human nature,
there lingered within me sufficient resentment for the persistent
disregard he had always paid to my suspicions of Henry Clavering to make
it a matter of moment to me to spring this knowledge upon him just at
the instant his own convictions seemed to have reached the point of
absolute certainty, I cannot say.Enough that it was not till I had
given him a full account of every other matter connected with my stay in
this house; not till I saw his eye beaming, and his lip quivering with
the excitement incident upon the perusal of the letter from Mary, found
in Mrs.Belden's pocket; not, indeed, until I became assured from such
expressions as "Tremendous!Nothing
like it since the Lafarge affair!"that in another moment he would be
uttering some theory or belief that once heard would forever stand like
a barrier between us, did I allow myself to hand him the letter I had
taken from under the dead body of Hannah.I shall never forget his expression as he received it; "Good heavens!"I found it lying in her bed when
I went up, a half-hour ago, to take a second look at her."Opening it, he glanced over it with an incredulous air that speedily,
however, turned to one of the utmost astonishment, as he hastily perused
it, and then stood turning it over and over in his hand, examining it."A remarkable piece of evidence," I observed, not without a certain
feeling of triumph; "quite changes the aspect of affairs!"he sharply retorted; then, whilst I stood staring at him in
amazement, his manner was so different from what I expected, looked up
and said: "You tell me that you found this in her bed."Under the body of the girl herself," I returned."I saw one corner of
it protruding from beneath her shoulders, and drew it out.""Was it folded or open, when you first
looked at it?""Folded; fastened up in this envelope," showing it to him.He took it, looked at it for a moment, and went on with his questions."This envelope has a very crumpled appearance, as well as the letter
itself."Yes, not only so, but doubled up as you see."Folded, sealed, and then doubled up
as if her body had rolled across it while alive?"No look as if the thing had been insinuated there
since her death?"I should rather say that to every appearance she held it in
her hand when she lay down, but turning over, dropped it and then laid
upon it."Gryce's eyes, which had been very bright, ominously clouded;
evidently he had been disappointed in my answers, paying the letter
down, he stood musing, but suddenly lifted it again, scrutinized the
edges of the paper on which it was written, and, darting me a quick
look, vanished with it into the shade of the window curtain.His manner
was so peculiar, I involuntarily rose to follow; but he waved me back,
saying:

"Amuse yourself with that box on the table, which you had such an ado
over; see if it contains all we have a right to expect to find in it.I
want to be by myself for a moment."Subduing my astonishment, I proceeded to comply with his request, but
scarcely had I lifted the lid of the box before me when he came hurrying
back, flung the letter down on the table with an air of the greatest
excitement, and cried:

"Did I say there had never been anything like it since the Lafarge
affair?I tell you there has never been anything like it in any affair.It is the rummest case on record!Raymond," and his eyes, in his
excitement, actually met mine for the first time in my experience of
him, "prepare yourself for a disappointment.This pretended confession
of Hannah's is a fraud!""Yes; fraud, forgery, what you will; the girl never wrote it."Amazed, outraged almost, I bounded from my chair.Bending forward, he put the letter into my hand."Look at it," said he;
"examine it closely.Now tell me what is the first thing you notice in
regard to it?""Why, the first thing that strikes me, is that the words are printed,
instead of written; something which might be expected from this girl,
according to all accounts.""That they are printed on the inside of a sheet of ordinary paper----"

"Ordinary paper?""That is, a sheet of commercial note of the ordinary quality.""Why, yes; I should say so."Oh, I see, they run up close to the top of the page;
evidently the scissors have been used here.""In short, it is a large sheet, trimmed down to the size of commercial
note?""Don't you perceive what has been lost by means of this trimming down?""No, unless you mean the manufacturer's stamp in the corner.""But I don't see why the loss of that
should be deemed a matter of any importance."Not when you consider that by it we seem to be deprived of
all opportunity of tracing this sheet back to the quire of paper from
which it was taken?"then you are more of an amateur than I thought you.Don't you
see that, as Hannah could have had no motive for concealing where the
paper came from on which she wrote her dying words, this sheet must have
been prepared by some one else?""No," said I; "I cannot say that I see all that."Why should Hannah, a girl about to
commit suicide, care whether any clue was furnished, in her confession,
to the actual desk, drawer, or quire of paper from which the sheet was
taken, on which she wrote it?""Yet especial pains have been taken to destroy that clue.""But----"

"Then there is another thing.Raymond,
and tell me what you gather from it.""Why," said I, after complying, "that the girl, worn out with constant
apprehension, has made up her mind to do away with herself, and that
Henry Clavering----"

"Henry Clavering?"The interrogation was put with so much meaning, I looked up."Ah, I didn't know that Mr.Clavering's name was mentioned there; excuse
me.""His name is not mentioned, but a description is given so strikingly in
accordance----"

Here Mr."Does it not seem a little surprising to
you that a girl like Hannah should have stopped to describe a man she
knew by name?"Belden's story, don't you?""Consider her accurate in her relation of what took place here a year
ago?""Must believe, then, that Hannah, the go-between, was acquainted with
Mr.If her intention was, as she here
professes, to save Eleanore Leavenworth from the false imputation which
had fallen upon her, she would naturally take the most direct method
of doing it.This description of a man whose identity she could have at
once put beyond a doubt by the mention of his name is the work, not of
a poor, ignorant girl, but of some person who, in attempting to play the
_role_ of one, has signally failed.Belden,
according to you, maintains that Hannah told her, upon entering the
house, that Mary Leavenworth sent her here.But in this document, she
declares it to have been the work of Black Mustache.""I know; but could they not have both been parties to the transaction?""Yes," said he; "yet it is always a suspicious circumstance, when there
is a discrepancy between the written and spoken declaration of a person.But why do we stand here fooling, when a few words from this Mrs.Belden, you talk so much about, will probably settle the whole matter!""I have had thousands
from her to-day, and find the matter no nearer settled than in the
beginning.""_You_ have had," said he, "but I have not."One thing," said I, "before I go.What if Hannah had found the
sheet of paper, trimmed just as it is, and used it without any thought
of the suspicions it would occasion!"said he, "that is just what we are going to find out."Belden was in a flutter of impatience when I entered the
sitting-room.and what did I
imagine this detective would do for us?It was dreadful waiting there
alone for something, she knew not what.I calmed her as well as I could, telling her the detective had not yet
informed me what he could do, having some questions to ask her first.Gryce, who in the short interim of my absence had altered his mood
from the severe to the beneficent, received Mrs.Belden with just that
show of respectful courtesy likely to impress a woman as dependent as
she upon the good opinion of others.and this is the lady in whose house this very disagreeable event
has occurred," he exclaimed, partly rising in his enthusiasm to greet
her."May I request you to sit," he asked; "if a stranger may be allowed
to take the liberty of inviting a lady to sit in her own house.""It does not seem like my own house any longer," said she, but in a sad,
rather than an aggressive tone; so much had his genial way imposed upon
her."Little better than a prisoner here, go and come, keep silence or
speak, just as I am bidden; and all because an unhappy creature, whom
I took in for the most unselfish of motives, has chanced to die in my
house!"This sudden death
ought to be easily explained.You say you had no poison in the house?""And that no one has ever been here to see her?""So that she could not have procured any such thing if she had wished?""Unless," he added suavely, "she had it with her when she came here?"She brought no baggage; and as for her
pocket, I know everything there was in it, for I looked.""Some money in bills, more than you would have expected such a girl to
have, some loose pennies, and a common handkerchief.""Well, then, it is proved the girl didn't die of poison, there being
none in the house."He said this in so convinced a tone she was deceived."That is just what I have been telling Mr.Raymond," giving me a
triumphant look."Must have been heart disease," he went on, "You say she was well
yesterday?""I did not say that; she was, sir, very.""What, ma'am, this girl?"I
should think her anxiety about those she had left behind her in the city
would have been enough to keep her from being very cheerful."Belden; "but it wasn't so.On the
contrary, she never seemed to worry about them at all."not about Miss Eleanore, who, according to the papers, stands
in so cruel a position before the world?But perhaps she didn't know
anything about that--Miss Leavenworth's position, I mean?""Yes, she did, for I told her.I was so astonished I could not keep
it to myself.You see, I had always considered Eleanore as one above
reproach, and it so shocked me to see her name mentioned in the
newspaper in such a connection, that I went to Hannah and read the
article aloud, and watched her face to see how she took it."She looked as if she didn't understand; asked me why I
read such things to her, and told me she didn't want to hear any more;
that I had promised not to trouble her about this murder, and that if I
continued to do so she wouldn't listen."She put her hand over her ears and frowned in such a
sullen way I left the room.""She has, however, mentioned the subject since?"not asked what they were going to do with her mistress?""She has shown, however, that something was preying on her mind--fear,
remorse, or anxiety?""No, sir; on the contrary, she has oftener appeared like one secretly
elated."Gryce, with another sidelong look at me, "that was
very strange and unnatural.I used to try to explain it by thinking her sensibilities
had been blunted, or that she was too ignorant to comprehend the
seriousness of what had happened; but as I learned to know her better,
I gradually changed my mind.There was too much method in her gayety for
that.I could not help seeing she had some future before her for which
she was preparing herself.As, for instance, she asked me one day if I
thought she could learn to play on the piano.And I finally came to the
conclusion she had been promised money if she kept the secret intrusted
to her, and was so pleased with the prospect that she forgot the
dreadful past, and all connected with it.At all events, that was the
only explanation I could find for her general industry and desire to
improve herself, or for the complacent smiles I detected now and then
stealing over her face when she didn't know I was looking."Not such a smile as crept over the countenance of Mr.Gryce at that
moment, I warrant.Belden, "which made her death such a
shock to me.I couldn't believe that so cheerful and healthy a creature
could die like that, all in one night, without anybody knowing anything
about it.But----"

"Wait one moment," Mr."You speak of her endeavors
to improve herself."Her desire to learn things she didn't know; as, for instance, to write
and read writing.She could only clumsily print when she came here."Gryce would take a piece out of my arm, he griped it so.Do you mean to say that since she has been with you
she has learned to write?""Yes, sir; I used to set her copies and----"

"Where are these copies?"Gryce, subduing his voice to its
most professional tone.I'd like
to see some of them.I always made it a point to destroy them as soon as
they had answered their purpose.I didn't like to have such things lying
around."Do," said he; "and I will go with you.I want to take a look at things
upstairs, any way."And, heedless of his rheumatic feet, he rose and
prepared to accompany her."This is getting very intense," I whispered, as he passed me.The smile he gave me in reply would have made the fortune of a Thespian
Mephistopheles.Of the ten minutes of suspense which I endured in their absence, I say
nothing.At the end of that time they returned with their hands full of
paper boxes, which they flung down on the table."The writing-paper of the household," observed Mr.Gryce; "every scrap
and half-sheet which could be found.But, before you examine it, look at
this."And he held out a sheet of bluish foolscap, on which were written
some dozen imitations of that time-worn copy, "BE GOOD AND YOU WILL
BE HAPPY"; with an occasional "_Beauty soon fades,"_ and "_Evil
communications corrupt good manners."_

"What do you think of that?"The only specimens of her writing to be found.Not much like some scrawls we have seen, eh?"Belden says this girl has known how to write as good as this for
more than a week.Took great pride in it, and was continually talking
about how smart she was."Leaning over, he whispered in my ear, "This
thing you have in your hand must have been scrawled some time ago, if
she did it."Then aloud: "But let us look at the paper she used to write
on."Dashing open the covers of the boxes on the table, he took out the loose
sheets lying inside, and scattered them out before me.One glance showed
they were all of an utterly different quality from that used in the
confession."This is all the paper in the house," said he.Belden, who stood in
a sort of maze before us."Wasn't there one stray sheet lying around
somewhere, foolscap or something like that, which she might have got
hold of and used without your knowing it?""No, sir; I don't think so.I had only these kinds; besides, Hannah had
a whole pile of paper like this in her room, and wouldn't have been apt
to go hunting round after any stray sheets.""But you don't know what a girl like that might do.Look at this one,"
said I, showing her the blank side of the confession."Couldn't a sheet
like this have come from somewhere about the house?Examine it well; the
matter is important.""I have, and I say, no, I never had a sheet of paper like that in my
house."Gryce advanced and took the confession from my hand.As he did so,
he whispered: "What do you think now?Many chances that Hannah got up
this precious document?"I shook my head, convinced at last; but in another moment turned to him
and whispered back: "But, if Hannah didn't write it, who did?And how
came it to be found where it was?""That," said he, "is just what is left for us to learn."And, beginning
again, he put question after question concerning the girl's life in the
house, receiving answers which only tended to show that she could not
have brought the confession with her, much less received it from a
secret messenger.Belden's word, the mystery
seemed impenetrable, and I was beginning to despair of success, when Mr.Gryce, with an askance look at me, leaned towards Mrs.Belden and said:

"You received a letter from Miss Mary Leavenworth yesterday, I hear.""Now I want to ask you a question.Was the letter, as you see it, the
only contents of the envelope in which it came?Wasn't there one for
Hannah enclosed with it?"There was nothing in my letter for her; but she had a letter
herself yesterday.we both exclaimed; "and in the mail?""Yes; but it was not directed to her.It was"--casting me a look full of
despair, "directed to me.It was only by a certain mark in the corner of
the envelope that I knew----"

"Good heaven!"Why didn't you
speak of it before?What do you mean by allowing us to flounder about
here in the dark, when a glimpse at this letter might have set us right
at once?""I didn't think anything about it till this minute.I didn't know it was
of importance.I----"

But I couldn't restrain myself."No," said she; "I gave it to the girl yesterday; I haven't seen it
since."and I hastened
towards the door."You won't find it," said Mr.There
is nothing but a pile of burned paper in the corner.By the way, what
could that have been?"She hadn't anything to burn unless it was the
letter.""We will see about that," I muttered, hurrying upstairs and bringing
down the wash-bowl with its contents."If the letter was the one I saw
in your hand at the post-office, it was in a yellow envelope.""Yellow envelopes burn differently from white paper.I ought to be able
to tell the tinder made by a yellow envelope when I see it.Ah, the
letter has been destroyed; here is a piece of the envelope," and I drew
out of the heap of charred scraps a small bit less burnt than the rest,
and held it up."Then there is no use looking here for what the letter contained," said
Mr.Gryce, putting the wash-bowl aside."We will have to ask you, Mrs.It was directed to me, to be sure; but Hannah told
me, when she first requested me to teach her how to write, that she
expected such a letter, so I didn't open it when it came, but gave it to
her just as it was.""You, however, stayed by to see her read it?""No, sir; I was in too much of a flurry.Raymond had just come and I
had no time to think of her.My own letter, too, was troubling me.""But you surely asked her some questions about it before the day was
out?""Yes, sir, when I went up with her tea things; but she had nothing
to say.Hannah could be as reticent as any one I ever knew, when she
pleased.She didn't even admit it was from her mistress."then you thought it was from Miss Leavenworth?""Why, yes, sir; what else was I to think, seeing that mark in the
corner?Though, to be sure, it might have been put there by Mr."You say she was cheerful yesterday; was she so after receiving this
letter?""Yes, sir; as far as I could see.I wasn't with her long; the necessity
I felt of doing something with the box in my charge--but perhaps Mr."It was an exhausting evening, and quite put Hannah out of my head,
but----"

"Wait!"Gryce, and beckoning me into a corner, he whispered,
"Now comes in that experience of Q's.While you are gone from the house,
and before Mrs.Belden sees Hannah again, he has a glimpse of the girl
bending over something in the corner of her room which may very fairly
be the wash-bowl we found there.After which, he sees her swallow, in
the most lively way, a dose of something from a bit of paper."Very well, then," he cried, going back to Mrs."But----"

"But when I went upstairs to bed, I thought of the girl, and going to
her door opened it.The light was extinguished, and she seemed asleep,
so I closed it again and came out.""In something of the same position in which she was found this morning?""And that is all you can tell us, either of her letter or her mysterious
death?"Belden," said he, "you know Mr.Clavering's handwriting when _you_
see it?""Now, which of the two was upon the envelope of the letter you gave
Hannah?"It was a disguised handwriting and might have been that
of either; but I think----"

"Well?""That it was more like hers than his, though it wasn't like hers
either."Gryce enclosed the confession in his hand in the
envelope in which it had been found."You remember how large the letter
was which you gave her?""Oh, it was large, very large; one of the largest sort.""O yes; thick enough for two letters.""Large enough and thick enough to contain this?"laying the confession,
folded and enveloped as it was, before her."Yes, sir," giving it a look of startled amazement, "large enough and
thick enough to contain that."Gryce's eyes, bright as diamonds, flashed around the room, and
finally settled upon a fly traversing my coat-sleeve."Do you need to
ask now," he whispered, in a low voice, "where, and from whom, this
so-called confession comes?"He allowed himself one moment of silent triumph, then rising, began
folding the papers on the table and putting them in his pocket.He took me by the arm and led me across the hall into toe sitting-room."I am going back to New York, I am going to pursue this matter.I am
going to find out from whom came the poison which killed this girl, and
by whose hand this vile forgery of a confession was written.""But," said I, rather thrown off my balance by all this, "Q and the
coroner will be here presently, won't you wait to see them?""No; clues such as are given here must be followed while the trail is
hot; I can't afford to wait.""If I am not mistaken, they have already come," I remarked, as a
tramping of feet without announced that some one stood at the door."That is so," he assented, hastening to let them in.Judging from common experience, we had every reason to fear that an
immediate stop would be put to all proceedings on our part, as soon as
the coroner was introduced upon the scene.But happily for us and the
interest at stake, Dr.Fink, of R ----, proved to be a very sensible
man.He had only to hear a true story of the affair to recognize at
once its importance and the necessity of the most cautious action in
the matter.Further, by a sort of sympathy with Mr.Gryce, all the more
remarkable that he had never seen him before, he expressed himself
as willing to enter into our plans, offering not only to allow us the
temporary use of such papers as we desired, but even undertaking to
conduct the necessary formalities of calling a jury and instituting
an inquest in such a way as to give us time for the investigations we
proposed to make.Gryce was enabled to take the 6:30
train for New York, and I to follow on the 10 p.m.,--the calling of a
jury, ordering of an autopsy, and final adjournment of the inquiry till
the following Tuesday, having all taken place in the interim.FINE WORK


    "No hinge nor loop
     To hang a doubt on!""But yet the pity of it, Iago!Oh, Iago, the pity of it, Iago."Gryce before leaving R---- prepared me for
his next move."The clue to this murder is supplied by the paper on which the
confession is written.Find from whose desk or portfolio this especial
sheet was taken, and you find the double murderer," he had said.Consequently, I was not surprised when, upon visiting his house, early
the next morning, I beheld him seated before a table on which lay
a lady's writing-desk and a pile of paper, till told the desk was
Eleanore's."What," said I, "are you not
satisfied yet of her innocence?""O yes; but one must be thorough.No conclusion is valuable which is not
preceded by a full and complete investigation.Why," he cried, casting
his eyes complacently towards the fire-tongs, "I have even been
rummaging through Mr.Clavering's effects, though the confession bears
the proof upon its face that it could not have been written by him.It
is not enough to look for evidence where you expect to find it.You must
sometimes search for it where you don't.Now," said he, drawing the desk
before him, "I don't anticipate finding anything here of a criminating
character; but it is among the possibilities that I may; and that is
enough for a detective.""Did you see Miss Leavenworth this morning?"I asked, as he proceeded
to fulfil his intention by emptying the contents of the desk upon the
table."Yes; I was unable to procure what I desired without it.And she behaved
very handsomely, gave me the desk with her own hands, and never raised
an objection.To be sure, she had little idea what I was looking for;
thought, perhaps, I wanted to make sure it did not contain the letter
about which so much has been said.But it would have made but little
difference if she had known the truth.This desk contains nothing _we_
want.""Was she well; and had she heard of Hannah's sudden death?"I asked, in
my irrepressible anxiety."Yes, and feels it, as you might expect her to.But let us see what we
have here," said he, pushing aside the desk, and drawing towards him the
stack of paper I have already referred to."I found this pile, just as
you see it, in a drawer of the library table at Miss Mary Leavenworth's
house in Fifth Avenue.If I am not mistaken, it will supply us with the
clue we want.""But----"

"But this paper is square, while that of the confession is of the size
and shape of commercial note?I know; but you remember the sheet used in
the confession was trimmed down.Taking the confession from his pocket and the sheet from the pile before
him, he carefully compared them, then held them out for my inspection.A
glance showed them to be alike in color."Hold them up to the light," said he.I did so; the appearance presented by both was precisely alike.And, laying them both down on the
table, he placed the edges of the two sheets together.The lines on the
one accommodated themselves to the lines on the other; and that question
was decided."I was convinced of it," said he."From the
moment I pulled open that drawer and saw this mass of paper, I knew the
end was come.""But," I objected, in my old spirit of combativeness, "isn't there any
room for doubt?Every family on the
block might easily have specimens of it in their library.""It is letter size, and that has gone out.Leavenworth used it for his manuscript, or I doubt if it would have been
found in his library.But, if you are still incredulous, let us see what
can be done," and jumping up, he carried the confession to the window,
looked at it this way and that, and, finally discovering what he wanted,
came back and, laying it before me, pointed out one of the lines of
ruling which was markedly heavier than the rest, and another which was
so faint as to be almost undistinguishable."Defects like these often
run through a number of consecutive sheets," said he."If we could find
the identical half-quire from which this was taken, I might show you
proof that would dispel every doubt," and taking up the one that lay on
top, he rapidly counted the sheets."It might have
been taken from this one," said he; but, upon looking closely at the
ruling, he found it to be uniformly distinct.The remainder of the paper, some dozen or so half-quires, looked
undisturbed.Gryce tapped his fingers on the table and a frown
crossed his face."Such a pretty thing, if it could have been done!"Suddenly he took up the next half-quire."Count the
sheets," said he, thrusting it towards me, and himself lifting another."Go on with the rest," he cried.I counted the sheets in the next; twelve.He counted those in the one
following, and paused.He counted again, and quietly put them aside."I made a mistake," said
he.Taking another half-quire, he went
through with the same operation;--in vain.With a sigh of impatience he
flung it down on the table and looked up.he cried, "what is
the matter?""There are but eleven sheets in this package," I said, placing it in his
hand.The excitement he immediately evinced was contagious.Oppressed as I
was, I could not resist his eagerness.the light on the inside, the heavy one on the
outside, and both in positions precisely corresponding to those on
this sheet of Hannah's."The veriest doubter must succumb before this," returned I.

With something like a considerate regard for my emotion, he turned away."I am obliged to congratulate myself, notwithstanding the gravity of the
discovery that has been made," said he."It is so neat, so very neat,
and so conclusive.I declare I am myself astonished at the perfection
of the thing.he suddenly cried, in a tone
of the greatest admiration.I declare it is almost a pity to entrap a woman who has done
as well as this--taken a sheet from the very bottom of the pile, trimmed
it into another shape, and then, remembering the girl couldn't write,
put what she had to say into coarse, awkward printing, Hannah-like.or would have been, if any other man than myself had
had this thing in charge."And, all animated and glowing with his
enthusiasm, he eyed the chandelier above him as if it were the
embodiment of his own sagacity.Sunk in despair, I let him go on."Watched, circumscribed
as she was, could she have done any better?I hardly think so; the fact
of Hannah's having learned to write after she left here was fatal.No,
she could not have provided against that contingency."Gryce," I here interposed, unable to endure this any longer; "did
you have an interview with Miss Mary Leavenworth this morning?""No," said he; "it was not in the line of my present purpose to do so.I
doubt, indeed, if she knew I was in her house.A servant maid who has a
grievance is a very valuable assistant to a detective.With Molly at my
side, I didn't need to pay my respects to the mistress."Gryce," I asked, after another moment of silent self-congratulation
on his part, and of desperate self-control on mine, "what do you propose
to do now?You have followed your clue to the end and are satisfied.Such knowledge as this is the precursor of action."we will see," he returned, going to his private desk and
bringing out the box of papers which we had no opportunity of looking at
while in R----."First let us examine these documents, and see if they
do not contain some hint which may be of service to us."And taking out
the dozen or so loose sheets which had been torn from Eleanore's Diary,
he began turning them over.While he was doing this, I took occasion to examine the contents of
the box.Belden had led me to
expect,--a certificate of marriage between Mary and Mr.Clavering and
a half-dozen or more letters.While glancing over the former, a short
exclamation from Mr.He thrust into my hand the leaves of Eleanore's Diary."Most of it is a repetition of what you have already heard from Mrs.Belden, though given from a different standpoint; but there is one
passage in it which, if I am not mistaken, opens up the way to an
explanation of this murder such as we have not had yet.Begin at the
beginning; you won't find it dull."Eleanore's feelings and thoughts during that anxious time, dull!Mustering up my self-possession, I spread out the leaves in their order
and commenced:

"R----, July 6,-"

"Two days after they got there, you perceive," Mr.--A gentleman was introduced to us to-day upon the _piazza_ whom
I cannot forbear mentioning; first, because he is the most perfect
specimen of manly beauty I ever beheld, and secondly, because Mary, who
is usually so voluble where gentlemen are concerned, had nothing to say
when, in the privacy of our own apartment, I questioned her as to the
effect his appearance and conversation had made upon her.The fact
that he is an Englishman may have something to do with this; Uncle's
antipathy to every one of that nation being as well known to her as to
me.Her experience with
Charlie Somerville has made me suspicious.What if the story of last
summer were to be repeated here, with an Englishman for the hero!But
I will not allow myself to contemplate such a possibility.Uncle will
return in a few days, and then all communication with one who, however
prepossessing, is of a family and race with whom it is impossible for
us to unite ourselves, must of necessity cease.I doubt if I should have
thought twice of all this if Mr.Clavering had not betrayed, upon his
introduction to Mary, such intense and unrestrained admiration.Mary not only submits to the
attentions of Mr.To-day she sat
two hours at the piano singing over to him her favorite songs, and
to-night--But I will not put down every trivial circumstance that comes
under my observation; it is unworthy of me.And yet, how can I shut my
eyes when the happiness of so many I love is at stake!Clavering is not absolutely in love with Mary, he is on
the verge of it.He is a very fine-looking man, and too honorable to be
trifled with in this reckless fashion.She was absolutely
wonderful to-night in scarlet and silver.I think her smile the sweetest
I ever beheld, and in this I am sure Mr.Clavering passionately agrees
with me; he never looked away from her to-night.But it is not so easy
to read _her_ heart.To be sure, she appears anything but indifferent
to his fine appearance, strong sense, and devoted affection.But did she
not deceive us into believing she loved Charlie Somerville?In her case,
blush and smile go for little, I fear.Would it not be wiser under the
circumstances to say, I hope?Mary came into my room this evening, and
absolutely startled me by falling at my side and burying her face in my
lap.'Oh, Eleanore, Eleanore!'she murmured, quivering with what seemed
to me very happy sobs.But when I strove to lift her head to my breast,
she slid from my arms, and drawing herself up into her old attitude of
reserved pride, raised her hand as if to impose silence, and haughtily
left the room.There is but one interpretation to put upon this.Clavering has expressed his sentiments, and she is filled with that
reckless delight which in its first flush makes one insensible to the
existence of barriers which have hitherto been deemed impassable.Little did I think when I wrote the above that Uncle was
already in the house.He arrived unexpectedly on the last train, and
came into my room just as I was putting away my diary.Looking a little
care-worn, he took me in his arms and then asked for Mary.I dropped my
head, and could not help stammering as I replied that she was in her own
room.Instantly his love took alarm, and leaving me, he hastened to
her apartment, where I afterwards learned he came upon her sitting
abstractedly before her dressing-table with Mr.Clavering's family ring
on her finger.An unhappy scene, I fear,
for Mary is ill this morning, and Uncle exceedingly melancholy and
stern.Uncle not only refuses to consider
for a moment the question of Mary's alliance with Mr.Clavering, but
even goes so far as to demand his instant and unconditional dismissal.The knowledge of this came to me in the most distressing way.Recognizing the state of affairs, but secretly rebelling against a
prejudice which seemed destined to separate two persons otherwise fitted
for each other, I sought Uncle's presence this morning after breakfast,
and attempted to plead their cause.But he almost instantly stopped me
with the remark, 'You are the last one, Eleanore, who should seek to
promote this marriage.'Trembling with apprehension, I asked him
why.'For the reason that by so doing you work entirely for your own
interest.'More and more troubled, I begged him to explain himself.'I
mean,' said he, 'that if Mary disobeys me by marrying this Englishman,
I shall disinherit her, and substitute your name for hers in my will as
well as in my affection.'"For a moment everything swam before my eyes.'You will never make me so
wretched!''I will make you my heiress, if Mary persists
in her present determination,' he declared, and without further word
sternly left the room.What could I do but fall on my knees and pray!Of all in this miserable house, I am the most wretched.But I shall not be called upon to do it; Mary will give up Mr.Isn't it
becoming plain enough what was Mary's motive for this murder?But go on;
let us hear what followed."The next entry is dated July 19, and
runs thus:

"I was right.After a long struggle with Uncle's invincible will, Mary
has consented to dismiss Mr.I was in the room when she
made known her decision, and I shall never forget our Uncle's look of
gratified pride as he clasped her in his arms and called her his own
True Heart.He has evidently been very much exercised over this matter,
and I cannot but feel greatly relieved that affairs have terminated
so satisfactorily.What is there in her manner that vaguely
disappoints me?I only know that I felt a powerful
shrinking overwhelm me when she turned her face to me and asked if I
were satisfied now.But I conquered my feelings and held out my hand.The shadow of our late trial is upon
me yet; I cannot shake it off.Clavering's despairing
face wherever I go.How is it that Mary preserves her cheerfulness?If
she does not love him, I should think the respect which she must feel
for his disappointment would keep her from levity at least.Nothing I could say sufficed to keep him.Mary has only nominally separated from
Mr.Clavering; she still cherishes the idea of one day uniting herself
to him in marriage.The fact was revealed to me in a strange way not
necessary to mention here; and has since been confirmed by Mary herself.'I admire the man,' she declares, 'and have no intention of giving him
up.'Her only answer was a bitter
smile and a short,--'I leave that for you to do.'Worn completely out, but before my blood cools let
me write.I have just returned from seeing her give her
hand to Henry Clavering.Strange that I can write it without quivering
when my whole soul is one flush of indignation and revolt.Having left my room for a few minutes this morning,
I returned to find on my dressing-table a note from Mary in which she
informed me that she was going to take Mrs.Belden for a drive and would
not be back for some hours.Convinced, as I had every reason to be, that
she was on her way to meet Mr.Clavering, I only stopped to put on my
hat--"

There the Diary ceased."She was probably interrupted by Mary at this point," explained Mr."But we have come upon the one thing we wanted to know.Leavenworth threatened to supplant Mary with Eleanore if she persisted
in marrying contrary to his wishes.She did so marry, and to avoid the
consequences of her act she----"

"Say no more," I returned, convinced at last."But the writer of these words is saved," I went on, trying to grasp
the one comfort left me."No one who reads this Diary will ever dare to
insinuate she is capable of committing a crime.""Assuredly not; the Diary settles that matter effectually."I tried to be man enough to think of that and nothing else.To rejoice
in her deliverance, and let every other consideration go; but in this I
did not succeed."But Mary, her cousin, almost her sister, is lost," I
muttered.Gryce thrust his hands into his pockets and, for the first time,
showed some evidence of secret disturbance."Yes, I am afraid she is;
I really am afraid she is."Then after a pause, during which I felt a
certain thrill of vague hope: "Such an entrancing creature too!It is a
pity, it positively is a pity!I declare, now that the thing is worked
up, I begin to feel almost sorry we have succeeded so well.If there was the least loophole out of it," he muttered.The thing is clear as A, B, C."Suddenly he rose, and began
pacing the floor very thoughtfully, casting his glances here, there, and
everywhere, except at me, though I believe now, as then, my face was all
he saw."Would it be a very great grief to you, Mr.Raymond, if Miss Mary
Leavenworth should be arrested on this charge of murder?"he asked,
pausing before a sort of tank in which two or three disconsolate-looking
fishes were slowly swimming about."Yes," said I, "it would; a very great grief.""Yet it must be done," said he, though with a strange lack of his usual
decision."As an honest official, trusted to bring the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth to the notice of the proper authorities, I have got to do
it."Again that strange thrill of hope at my heart induced by his peculiar
manner.I am not so rich or so famous that I can afford to forget all that a
success like this may bring me.No, lovely as she is, I have got to push
it through."But even as he said this, he became still more thoughtful,
gazing down into the murky depths of the wretched tank before him with
such an intentness I half expected the fascinated fishes to rise from
the water and return his gaze.After a little while he turned, his indecision utterly gone.I shall then have my report ready for
the Superintendent.I should like to show it to you first, so don't fail
me."There was something so repressed in his expression, I could not prevent
myself from venturing one question."Yes," he returned, but in a peculiar tone, and with a peculiar gesture."And you are going to make the arrest you speak of?"GATHERED THREADS


    "This is the short and the long of it."PROMPTLY at the hour named, I made my appearance at Mr.I
found him awaiting me on the threshold."I have met you," said he gravely, "for the purpose of requesting you
not to speak during the coming interview.I am to do the talking; you
the listening.Neither are you to be surprised at anything I may do or
say.I am in a facetious mood"--he did not look so--"and may take it
into my head to address you by another name than your own.If I do,
don't mind it.Above all, don't talk: remember that."And without
waiting to meet my look of doubtful astonishment, he led me softly
up-stairs.The room in which I had been accustomed to meet him was at the top of
the first flight, but he took me past that into what appeared to be the
garret story, where, after many cautionary signs, he ushered me into
a room of singularly strange and unpromising appearance.In the first
place, it was darkly gloomy, being lighted simply by a very dim and
dirty skylight.Next, it was hideously empty; a pine table and two
hard-backed chairs, set face to face at each end of it, being the only
articles in the room.Lastly, it was surrounded by several closed doors
with blurred and ghostly ventilators over their tops which, being round,
looked like the blank eyes of a row of staring mummies.Altogether it
was a lugubrious spot, and in the present state of my mind made me
feel as if something unearthly and threatening lay crouched in the very
atmosphere.Nor, sitting there cold and desolate, could I imagine that
the sunshine glowed without, or that life, beauty, and pleasure paraded
the streets below.Gryce's expression, as he took a seat and beckoned me to do the
same, may have had something to do with this strange sensation, it was
so mysteriously and sombrely expectant."You'll not mind the room," said he, in so muffled a tone I scarcely
heard him."It's an awful lonesome spot, I know; but folks with such
matters before them mustn't be too particular as to the places in which
they hold their consultations, if they don't want all the world to know
as much as they do.Smith," and he gave me an admonitory shake of his
finger, while his voice took a more distinct tone, "I have done the
business; the reward is mine; the assassin of Mr.Leavenworth is found,
and in two hours will be in custody.Do you want to know who it
is?"leaning forward with every appearance of eagerness in tone and
expression.any
great change taken place in his conclusions?All this preparation could
not be for the purpose of acquainting me with what I already knew, yet--

He cut short my conjectures with a low, expressive chuckle."It was a
long chase, I tell you," raising his voice still more; "a tight go; a
woman in the business too; but all the women in the world can't pull
the wool over the eyes of Ebenezer Gryce when he is on a trail; and the
assassin of Mr.Leavenworth and"--here his voice became actually shrill
in his excitement--"and of Hannah Chester is found.he went on, though I had neither spoken nor made any move; "you
didn't know Hannah Chester was murdered.Well, she wasn't in one sense
of the word, but in another she was, and by the same hand that killed
the old gentleman.This scrap of paper
was found on the floor of her room; it had a few particles of white
powder sticking to it; those particles were tested last night and found
to be poison.But you say the girl took it herself, that she was a
suicide.You are right, she did take it herself, and it was a suicide;
but who terrified her into this act of self-destruction?Why, the one
who had the most reason to fear her testimony, of course.Well, sir, this girl left a confession behind her, throwing the
onus of the whole crime on a certain party believed to be innocent; this
confession was a forged one, known from three facts; first, that the
paper upon which it was written was unobtainable by the girl in the
place where she was; secondly, that the words used therein were printed
in coarse, awkward characters, whereas Hannah, thanks to the teaching of
the woman under whose care she has been since the murder, had learned to
write very well; thirdly, that the story told in the confession does not
agree with the one related by the girl herself.Now the fact of a forged
confession throwing the guilt upon an innocent party having been found
in the keeping of this ignorant girl, killed by a dose of poison, taken
with the fact here stated, that on the morning of the day on which she
killed herself the girl received from some one manifestly acquainted
with the customs of the Leavenworth family a letter large enough and
thick enough to contain the confession folded, as it was when found,
makes it almost certain to my mind that the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth
sent this powder and this so-called confession to the girl, meaning
her to use them precisely as she did: for the purpose of throwing off
suspicion from the right track and of destroying herself at the same
time; for, as you know, dead men tell no tales."He paused and looked at the dingy skylight above us.Why did the
air seem to grow heavier and heavier?Why did I shudder in vague
apprehension?I knew all this before; why did it strike me, then, as
something new?Ah, that is the secret; that is the bit of
knowledge which is to bring me fame and fortune.But, secret or not,
I don't mind telling you"; lowering his voice and rapidly raising it
again."The fact is, _I_ can't keep it to myself; it burns like a new
dollar in my pocket.Smith, my boy, the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth--but
stay, who does the world say it is?Whom do the papers point at and
shake their heads over?a young, beautiful, bewitching woman!The papers are right; it is a woman; young, beautiful, and
bewitching too.There is more
than one woman in this affair.Since Hannah's death I have heard it
openly advanced that she was the guilty party in the crime: bah!Others
cry it is the niece who was so unequally dealt with by her uncle in his
will: bah!But folks are not without some justification for this
latter assertion.Eleanore Leavenworth did know more of this matter than
appeared.Worse than that, Eleanore Leavenworth stands in a position of
positive peril to-day.If you don't think so, let me show you what the
detectives have against her."First, there is the fact that a handkerchief, with her name on it, was
found stained with pistol grease upon the scene of murder; a place which
she explicitly denies having entered for twenty-four hours previous to
the discovery of the dead body."Secondly, the fact that she not only evinced terror when confronted
with this bit of circumstantial evidence, but manifested a decided
disposition, both at this time and others, to mislead inquiry, shirking
a direct answer to some questions and refusing all answer to others."Thirdly, that an attempt was made by her to destroy a certain letter
evidently relating to this crime."Fourthly, that the key to the library door was seen in her possession."All this, taken with the fact that the fragments of the letter which
this same lady attempted to destroy within an hour after the inquest
were afterwards put together, and were found to contain a bitter
denunciation of one of Mr.Leavenworth's nieces, by a gentleman we will
call _X_ in other words, an unknown quantity--makes out a dark case
against _you,_ especially as after investigations revealed the fact that
a secret underlay the history of the Leavenworth family.That, unknown
to the world at large, and Mr.Leavenworth in particular, a marriage
ceremony had been performed a year before in a little town called F----
between a Miss Leavenworth and this same _X._ That, in other words, the
unknown gentleman who, in the letter partly destroyed by Miss Eleanore
Leavenworth, complained to Mr.Leavenworth of the treatment received
by him from one of his nieces, was in fact the secret husband of that
niece.And that, moreover, this same gentleman, under an assumed name,
called on the night of the murder at the house of Mr.Leavenworth and
asked for Miss Eleanore."Now you see, with all this against her, Eleanore Leavenworth is lost
if it cannot be proved, first that the articles testifying against her,
viz.: the handkerchief, letter, and key, passed after the murder through
other hands, before reaching hers; and secondly, that some one else had
even a stronger reason than she for desiring Mr.Leavenworth's death at
this time."Smith, my boy, both of these hypotheses have been established by me.By dint of moleing into old secrets, and following unpromising clues, I
have finally come to the conclusion that not Eleanore Leavenworth, dark
as are the appearances against her, but another woman, beautiful as
she, and fully as interesting, is the true criminal.In short, that her
cousin, the exquisite Mary, is the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth, and by
inference of Hannah Chester also."He brought this out with such force, and with such a look of triumph
and appearance of having led up to it, that I was for the moment
dumbfounded, and started as if I had not known what he was going to say.The stir I made seemed to awake an echo.Something like a suppressed
cry was in the air about me.All the room appeared to breathe horror and
dismay.Yet when, in the excitement of this fancy, I half turned round
to look, I found nothing but the blank eyes of those dull ventilators
staring upon me.Every one
else is engaged in watching the movements of Eleanore Leavenworth; I
only know where to put my hand upon the real culprit.Ebenezer Gryce deceived after a month of hard work!You are as
bad as Miss Leavenworth herself, who has so little faith in my sagacity
that she offered me, of all men, an enormous reward if I would find for
her the assassin of her uncle!But that is neither here nor there;
you have your doubts, and you are waiting for me to solve them.Know first that on the morning of the inquest I made
one or two discoveries not to be found in the records, viz.: that the
handkerchief picked up, as I have said, in Mr.Leavenworth's library,
had notwithstanding its stains of pistol grease, a decided perfume
lingering about it.Going to the dressing-table of the two ladies, I
sought for that perfume, and found it in Mary's room, not Eleanore's.This led me to examine the pockets of the dresses respectively worn by
them the evening before.In that of Eleanore I found a handkerchief,
presumably the one she had carried at that time.But in Mary's there was
none, nor did I see any lying about her room as if tossed down on
her retiring.The conclusion I drew from this was, that she, and
not Eleanore, had carried the handkerchief into her uncle's room, a
conclusion emphasized by the fact privately communicated to me by one of
the servants, that Mary was in Eleanore's room when the basket of clean
clothes was brought up with this handkerchief lying on top."But knowing the liability we are to mistake in such matters as these,
I made another search in the library, and came across a very curious
thing.Lying on the table was a penknife, and scattered on the floor
beneath, in close proximity to the chair, were two or three minute
portions of wood freshly chipped off from the leg of the table; all of
which looked as if some one of a nervous disposition had been sitting
there, whose hand in a moment of self-forgetfulness had caught up the
knife and unconsciously whittled the table.A little thing, you say;
but when the question is, which of two ladies, one of a calm and
self-possessed nature, the other restless in her ways and excitable in
her disposition, was in a certain spot at a certain time, it is these
little things that become almost deadly in their significance.No one
who has been with these two women an hour can hesitate as to whose
delicate hand made that cut in Mr.I distinctly overheard Eleanore accuse her cousin
of this deed.Now such a woman as Eleanore Leavenworth has proved
herself to be never would accuse a relative of crime without the
strongest and most substantial reasons.First, she must have been sure
her cousin stood in a position of such emergency that nothing but
the death of her uncle could release her from it; secondly, that her
cousin's character was of such a nature she would not hesitate to
relieve herself from a desperate emergency by the most desperate of
means; and lastly, been in possession of some circumstantial evidence
against her cousin, seriously corroborative of her suspicions.Smith,
all this was true of Eleanore Leavenworth.As to the character of her
cousin, she has had ample proof of her ambition, love of money, caprice
and deceit, it having been Mary Leavenworth, and not Eleanore, as was
first supposed, who had contracted the secret marriage already spoken
of.Of the critical position in which she stood, let the threat once
made by Mr.Leavenworth to substitute her cousin's name for hers in
his will in case she had married this _x_ be remembered, as well as the
tenacity with which Mary clung to her hopes of future fortune; while for
the corroborative testimony of her guilt which Eleanore is supposed
to have had, remember that previous to the key having been found in
Eleanore's possession, she had spent some time in her cousin's room; and
that it was at Mary's fireplace the half-burned fragments of that letter
were found,--and you have the outline of a report which in an hour's
time from this will lead to the arrest of Mary Leavenworth as the
assassin of her uncle and benefactor."A silence ensued which, like the darkness of Egypt, could be felt;
then a great and terrible cry rang through the room, and a man's form,
rushing from I knew not where, shot by me and fell at Mr.Gryce's feet
shrieking out:

"It is a lie!Mary Leavenworth is innocent as a babe unborn.CULMINATION


    "Saint seducing gold.""When our actions do not,
     Our fears do make us traitors."I NEVER saw such a look of mortal triumph on the face of a man as that
which crossed the countenance of the detective."Well," said he, "this is unexpected, but not wholly unwelcome.I am
truly glad to learn that Miss Leavenworth is innocent; but I must hear
some few more particulars before I shall be satisfied.Leavenworth, how comes it that things look so black against everybody
but yourself?"But in the hot, feverish eyes which sought him from the writhing form at
his feet, there was mad anxiety and pain, but little explanation.Seeing
him making unavailing efforts to speak, I drew near."Lean on me," said I, lifting him to his feet.His face, relieved forever from its mask of repression, turned towards
me with the look of a despairing spirit."Save
her--Mary--they are sending a report--stop it!""If there is a man here who believes in
God and prizes woman's honor, let him stop the issue of that report."And Henry Clavering, dignified as ever, but in a state of extreme
agitation, stepped into our midst through an open door at our right.But at the sight of his face, the man in our arms quivered, shrieked,
and gave one bound that would have overturned Mr.Clavering, herculean
of frame as he was, had not Mr.he cried; and holding back the secretary with one hand--where
was his rheumatism now!--he put the other in his pocket and drew thence
a document which he held up before Mr."It has not gone
yet," said he; "be easy.And you," he went on, turning towards Trueman
Harwell, "be quiet, or----"

His sentence was cut short by the man springing from his grasp."Let me have my revenge on him who, in face of all I
have done for Mary Leavenworth, dares to call her his wife!Let me--"
But at this point he paused, his quivering frame stiffening into stone,
and his clutching hands, outstretched for his rival's throat, falling
heavily back.Clavering's shoulder:
"it is she!she--" a low, shuddering sigh of longing and despair finished the
sentence: the door opened, and Mary Leavenworth stood before us!It was a moment to make young hairs turn gray.To see her face, so pale,
so haggard, so wild in its fixed horror, turned towards Henry Clavering,
to the utter ignoring of the real actor in this most horrible scene!Trueman Harwell could not stand it.cold, cold; not one glance for me,
though I have just drawn the halter from her neck and fastened it about
my own!"And, breaking from the clasp of the man who in his jealous rage would
now have withheld him, he fell on his knees before Mary, clutching her
dress with frenzied hands."You _shall_ look at me," he cried; "you
_shall_ listen to me!I will not lose body and soul for nothing.Mary,
they said you were in peril!I could not endure that thought, so I
uttered the truth,--yes, though I knew what the consequence would
be,--and all I want now is for you to say you believe me, when I swear
that I only meant to secure to you the fortune you so much desired; that
I never dreamed it would come to this; that it was because I loved you,
and hoped to win your love in return that I----"

But she did not seem to see him, did not seem to hear him.Her eyes were
fixed upon Henry Clavering with an awful inquiry in their depths, and
none but he could move her."Ice that you are, you
would not turn your head if I should call to you from the depths of
hell!"Pushing her hands down upon his
shoulders as though she would sweep some impediment from her path, she
endeavored to advance.she cried, indicating
her husband with one quivering hand."What has he done that he should be
brought here to confront me at this awful time?"'"I told her to come here to meet her uncle's murderer," whispered Mr.But before I could reply to her, before Mr.Clavering himself could
murmur a word, the guilty wretch before her had started to his feet.It is because these gentlemen,
chivalrous and honorable as they consider themselves, think that you,
the beauty and the Sybarite, committed with your own white hand the
deed of blood which has brought you freedom and fortune.Yes, yes, this
man"--turning and pointing at me--"friend as he has made himself out to
be, kindly and honorable as you have doubtless believed him, but who in
every look he has bestowed upon you, every word he has uttered in your
hearing during all these four horrible weeks, has been weaving a cord
for your neck--thinks you the assassin of your uncle, unknowing that a
man stood at your side ready to sweep half the world from your path if
that same white hand rose in bidding.now she could see him: now she could hear him!"Yes," clutching her robe again as she hastily recoiled; "didn't you
know it?When in that dreadful hour of your rejection by your uncle, you
cried aloud for some one to help you, didn't you know----"

"Don't!"she shrieked, bursting from him with a look of unspeakable
horror.she gasped, "is the mad cry of a stricken
woman for aid and sympathy the call for a murderer?"And turning away
in horror, she moaned: "Who that ever looks at me now will forget that
a man--such a man!--dared to think that, because I was in mortal
perplexity, I would accept the murder of my best friend as a relief from
it!""Oh, what a chastisement for folly!""What a punishment for the love of money which has always been
my curse!"Henry Clavering could no longer restrain himself, leaping to her side,
he bent over her.Are you guiltless of
any deeper wrong?Is there no link of complicity between you two?Have
you nothing on your soul but an inordinate desire to preserve your place
in your uncle's will, even at the risk of breaking my heart and wronging
your noble cousin?placing
his hand on her head, he pressed it slowly back and gazed into her eyes;
then, without a word, took her to his breast and looked calmly around
him.It was the uplifting of a stifling pall.No one in the room, unless it
was the wretched criminal shivering before us, but felt a sudden influx
of hope.Even Mary's own countenance caught a glow.she whispered,
withdrawing from his arms to look better into his face, "and is this the
man I have trifled with, injured, and tortured, till the very name of
Mary Leavenworth might well make him shudder?Is this he whom I married
in a fit of caprice, only to forsake and deny?Henry, do you declare
me innocent in face of all you have seen and heard; in face of that
moaning, chattering wretch before us, and my own quaking flesh and
evident terror; with the remembrance on your heart and in your mind of
the letter I wrote you the morning after the murder, in which I prayed
you to keep away from me, as I was in such deadly danger the least hint
given to the world that I had a secret to conceal would destroy me?Do
you, can you, will you, declare me innocent before God and the world?"A light such as had never visited her face before passed slowly over it."Then God forgive me the wrong I have done this noble heart, for I can
never forgive myself!"Before I
accept any further tokens of your generous confidence, let me show you
what I am.You shall know the worst of the woman you have taken to your
heart.Raymond," she cried, turning towards me for the first time,
"in those days when, with such an earnest desire for my welfare (you see
I do not believe this man's insinuations), you sought to induce me to
speak out and tell all I knew concerning this dreadful deed, I did not
do it because of my selfish fears.I knew the case looked dark against
me.Eleanore herself--and it was the keenest
pang I had to endure--believed me guilty.She knew
first, from the directed envelope she had found lying underneath my
uncle's dead body on the library table, that he had been engaged at the
moment of death in summoning his lawyer to make that change in his will
which would transfer my claims to her; secondly, that notwithstanding
my denial of the same, I had been down to his room the night before, for
she had heard my door open and my dress rustle as I passed out.But that
was not all; the key that every one felt to be a positive proof of guilt
wherever found, had been picked up by her from the floor of my room; the
letter written by Mr.Clavering to my uncle was found in my fire; and
the handkerchief which she had seen me take from the basket of clean
clothes, was produced at the inquest stained with pistol grease.I could not stir without encountering some new toil.I knew I was
innocent; but if I failed to satisfy my cousin of this, how could I
hope to convince the general public, if once called upon to do so.Worse
still, if Eleanore, with every apparent motive for desiring long life
to our uncle, was held in such suspicion because of a few circumstantial
evidences against her, what would I not have to fear if these evidences
were turned against me, the heiress!The tone and manner of the juryman
at the inquest that asked who would be most benefited by my uncle's will
showed but too plainly.When, therefore, Eleanore, true to her heart's
generous instincts, closed her lips and refused to speak when speech
would have been my ruin, I let her do it, justifying myself with the
thought that she had deemed me capable of crime, and so must bear the
consequences.Nor, when I saw how dreadful these were likely to
prove, did I relent.Fear of the ignominy, suspense, and danger which
confession would entail sealed my lips.That
was when, in the last conversation we had, I saw that, notwithstanding
appearances, you believed in Eleanore's innocence, and the thought
crossed me you might be induced to believe in mine if I threw myself
upon your mercy.Clavering came; and as in a flash I
seemed to realize what my future life would be, stained by suspicion,
and, instead of yielding to my impulse, went so far in the other
direction as to threaten Mr.Clavering with a denial of our marriage if
he approached me again till all danger was over."Yes, he will tell you that was my welcome to him when, with heart
and brain racked by long suspense, he came to my door for one word of
assurance that the peril I was in was not of my own making.That was the
greeting I gave him after a year of silence every moment of which was
torture to him.But he forgives me; I see it in his eyes; I hear it in
his accents; and you--oh, if in the long years to come you can forget
what I have made Eleanore suffer by my selfish fears; if with the shadow
of her wrong before you, you can by the grace of some sweet hope think
a little less hardly of me, do.As for this man--torture could not be
worse to me than this standing with him in the same room--let him
come forward and declare if I by look or word have given him reason to
believe I understood his passion, much less returned it.""Don't you see it was your indifference which
drove me mad?To stand before you, to agonize after you, to follow you
with thoughts in every move you made; to know my soul was welded to
yours with bands of steel no fire could melt, no force destroy, no
strain dissever; to sleep under the same roof, sit at the same table,
and yet meet not so much as one look to show me you understood!It was
that which made my life a hell.If I had to leap into a pit of flame, you should know what I was, and
what my passion for you was.Shrink as you will from my presence, cower as you may to the weak man
you call husband, you can never forget the love of Trueman Harwell;
never forget that love, love, love, was the force which led me down into
your uncle's room that night, and lent me will to pull the trigger which
poured all the wealth you hold this day into your lap.Yes," he went on,
towering in his preternatural despair till even the noble form of Henry
Clavering looked dwarfed beside him, "every dollar that chinks from
your purse shall talk of me.Every gew-gaw which flashes on that haughty
head, too haughty to bend to me, shall shriek my name into your ears.Fashion, pomp, luxury,--you will have them all; but till gold loses its
glitter and ease its attraction you will never forget the hand that gave
them to you!"With a look whose evil triumph I cannot describe, he put his hand into
the arm of the waiting detective, and in another moment would have been
led from the room; when Mary, crushing down the swell of emotions that
was seething in her breast, lifted her head and said:

"No, Trueman Harwell; I cannot give you even that thought for your
comfort.Wealth so laden would bring nothing but torture.I cannot
accept the torture, so must release the wealth.From this day, Mary
Clavering owns nothing but what comes to her from the husband she has so
long and so basely wronged."And raising her hands to her ears, she tore
out the diamonds which hung there, and flung them at the feet of the
unfortunate man.With a yell such as I never thought
to listen to from the lips of a man, he flung up his arms, while all the
lurid light of madness glared on his face."And I have given my soul to
hell for a shadow!""Well, that is the best day's work I ever did!Raymond, upon the success of the most daring game ever played in a
detective's office."I looked at the triumphant countenance of Mr.I cried; "did you plan all this?""Could I stand here, seeing how things
have turned out, if I had not?You
are a gentleman, but we can well shake hands over this.I have never
known such a satisfactory conclusion to a bad piece of business in all
my professional career."We did shake hands, long and fervently, and then I asked him to explain
himself."Well," said he, "there has always been one thing that plagued me, even
in the very moment of my strongest suspicion against this woman, and
that was, the pistol-cleaning business.I could not reconcile it with
what I knew of womankind.I could not make it seem the act of a woman.Did you ever know a woman who cleaned a pistol?They can fire them,
and do; but after firing them, they do not clean them.Now it is a
principle which every detective recognizes, that if of a hundred leading
circumstances connected with a crime, ninety-nine of these are acts
pointing to the suspected party with unerring certainty, but the
hundredth equally important act one which that person could not have
performed, the whole fabric of suspicion is destroyed.Recognizing this
principle, then, as I have said, I hesitated when it came to the point
of arrest.The chain was complete; the links were fastened; but one link
was of a different size and material from the rest; and in this argued a
break in the chain.Harwell, two persons whom I had no reason to suspect,
but who were the only persons beside herself who could have committed
this crime, being the only persons of intellect who were in the house
or believed to be, at the time of the murder, I notified them separately
that the assassin of Mr.Leavenworth was not only found, but was
about to be arrested in my house, and that if they wished to hear
the confession which would be sure to follow, they might have the
opportunity of doing so by coming here at such an hour.They were both
too much interested, though for very different reasons, to refuse; and
I succeeded in inducing them to conceal themselves in the two rooms from
which you saw them issue, knowing that if either of them had committed
this deed, he had done it for the love of Mary Leavenworth, and
consequently could not hear her charged with crime, and threatened
with arrest, without betraying himself.I did not hope much from the
experiment; least of all did I anticipate that Mr.Harwell would prove
to be the guilty man--but live and learn, Mr.A FULL CONFESSION


    "Between the acting of a dreadful thing,
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council; and the state of a man,
    Like to a little Kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection."I AM not a bad man; I am only an intense one.Ambition, love, jealousy,
hatred, revenge--transitory emotions with some, are terrific passions
with me.To be sure, they are quiet and concealed ones, coiled serpents
that make no stir till aroused; but then, deadly in their spring and
relentless in their action.Those who have known me best have not known
this.Often and often have I heard
her say: "If Trueman only had more sensibility!If Trueman were not so
indifferent to everything!In short, if Trueman had more power in him!"They thought me meek;
called me Dough-face.For three years they called me this, then I turned
upon them.Choosing out their ringleader, I felled him to the ground,
laid him on his back, and stamped upon him.He was handsome before
my foot came down; afterwards--Well, it is enough he never called me
Dough-face again.In the store I entered soon after, I met with even
less appreciation.Regular at my work and exact in my performance of it,
they thought me a good machine and nothing more.What heart, soul, and
feeling could a man have who never sported, never smoked, and never
laughed?I could reckon up figures correctly, but one scarcely needed
heart or soul for that.I could even write day by day and month by month
without showing a flaw in my copy; but that only argued I was no more
than they intimated, a regular automaton.I let them think so, with the
certainty before me that they would one day change their minds as others
had done.The fact was, I loved nobody well enough, not even myself,
to care for any man's opinion.Life was well-nigh a blank to me; a dead
level plain that had to be traversed whether I would or not.And such
it might have continued to this day if I had never met Mary Leavenworth.But when, some nine months since, I left my desk in the counting-house
for a seat in Mr.Leavenworth's library, a blazing torch fell into
my soul whose flame has never gone out, and never will, till the doom
before me is accomplished.When, on that first evening, I followed my new
employer into the parlor, and saw this woman standing up before me
in her half-alluring, half-appalling charm, I knew, as by a lightning
flash, what my future would be if I remained in that house.She was
in one of her haughty moods, and bestowed upon me little more than a
passing glance.But her indifference made slight impression upon me
then.It was enough that I was allowed to stand in her presence and look
unrebuked upon her loveliness.To be sure, it was like gazing into the
flower-wreathed crater of an awakening volcano.Fear and fascination
were in each moment I lingered there; but fear and fascination made the
moment what it was, and I could not have withdrawn if I would.Unspeakable pain as well as pleasure was in the
emotion with which I regarded her.Yet for all that I did not cease to
study her hour by hour and day by day; her smiles, her movement, her way
of turning her head or lifting her eyelids.I
wished to knit her beauty so firmly into the warp and woof of my being
that nothing could ever serve to tear it away.For I saw then as plainly
as now that, coquette though she was, she would never stoop to me.No;
I might lie down at her feet and let her trample over me; she would not
even turn to see what it was she had stepped upon.I might spend days,
months, years, learning the alphabet of her wishes; she would not thank
me for my pains or even raise the lashes from her cheek to look at me as
I passed.I was nothing to her, could not be anything unless--and this
thought came slowly--I could in some way become her master.Leavenworth's dictation and pleased him.My
methodical ways were just to his taste.As for the other member of the
family, Miss Eleanore Leavenworth--she treated me just as one of her
proud but sympathetic nature might be expected to do.Not familiarly,
but kindly; not as a friend, but as a member of the household whom she
met every day at table, and who, as she or any one else could see, was
none too happy or hopeful.I had learned two things; first, that Mary
Leavenworth loved her position as prospective heiress to a large fortune
above every other earthly consideration; and secondly, that she was in
the possession of a secret which endangered that position.What this
was, I had for some time no means of knowing.But when later I became
convinced it was one of love, I grew hopeful, strange as it may seem.Leavenworth's disposition almost as
perfectly as that of his niece, and knew that in a matter of this kind
he would be uncompromising; and that in the clashing of these two wills
something might occur which would give me a hold upon her.The only
thing that troubled me was the fact that I did not know the name of the
man in whom she was interested.One
day--a month ago now--I sat down to open Mr.ran thus:

"HOFFMAN HOUSE,

"March 1, 1876."HORATIO LEAVENWORTH:

"DEAR SIR,--You have a niece whom you love and trust, one, too, who
seems worthy of all the love and trust that you or any other man can
give her; so beautiful, so charming, so tender is she in face, form,
manner, and conversation.But, dear sir, every rose has its thorn, and
your rose is no exception to this rule.Lovely as she is, charming as
she is, tender as she is, she is not only capable of trampling on the
rights of one who trusted her, but of bruising the heart and breaking
the spirit of him to whom she owes all duty, honor, and observance."If you don't believe this, ask her to her cruel, bewitching face, who
and what is her humble servant, and yours.If a bombshell had exploded at my feet, or the evil one himself appeared
at my call, I would not have been more astounded.Not only was the name
signed to these remarkable words unknown to me, but the epistle itself
was that of one who felt himself to be her master: a position which, as
you know, I was myself aspiring to occupy.For a few minutes, then, I
stood a prey to feelings of the bitterest wrath and despair; then I grew
calm, realizing that with this letter in my possession I was virtually
the arbitrator of her destiny.Some men would have sought her there and
then and, by threatening to place it in her uncle's hand, won from her
a look of entreaty, if no more; but I--well, my plans went deeper than
that.I knew she would have to be in extremity before I could hope to
win her.She must feel herself slipping over the edge of the precipice
before she would clutch at the first thing offering succor.I decided
to allow the letter to pass into my employer's hands.How could I manage to give it to him in this condition without
exciting his suspicion?I knew of but one way; to let him see me open it
for what he would consider the first time.So, waiting till he came into
the room, I approached him with the letter, tearing off the end of the
envelope as I came.Opening it, I gave a cursory glance at its contents
and tossed it down on the table before him."That appears to be of a private character," said I, "though there is no
sign to that effect on the envelope."At the first word he started, looked
at me, seemed satisfied from my expression that I had not read far
enough to realize its nature, and, whirling slowly around in his chair,
devoured the remainder in silence.I waited a moment, then withdrew to
my own desk.One minute, two minutes passed in silence; he was evidently
rereading the letter; then he hurriedly rose and left the room.As he
passed me I caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror.The expression I
saw there did not tend to lessen the hope that was rising in my breast.By following him almost immediately up-stairs I ascertained that he
went directly to Mary's room, and when in a few hours later the family
collected around the dinner table, I perceived, almost without looking
up, that a great and insurmountable barrier had been raised between him
and his favorite niece.Two days passed; days that were for me one long and unrelieved suspense.Would it all end as it had
begun, without the appearance of the mysterious Clavering on the scene?Meanwhile my monotonous work went on, grinding my heart beneath its
relentless wheel.I wrote and wrote and wrote, till it seemed as if my
life blood went from me with every drop of ink I used.Always alert
and listening, I dared not lift my head or turn my eyes at any unusual
sound, lest I should seem to be watching.The third night I had a dream;
I have already told Mr.Raymond what it was, and hence will not repeat
it here.One correction, however, I wish to make in regard to it.In my
statement to him I declared that the face of the man whom I saw lift his
hand against my employer was that of Mr.The face seen by me in my dream was my own.It was that fact
which made it so horrible to me.In the crouching figure stealing warily
down-stairs, I saw as in a glass the vision of my own form.Otherwise my
account of the matter was true.a
forewarning of the way in which I was to win this coveted creature for
my own?Was the death of her uncle the bridge by which the impassable
gulf between us might be spanned?I began to think it might be; to
consider the possibilities which could make this the only path to
my elysium; even went so far as to picture her lovely face bending
gratefully towards me through the glare of a sudden release from some
emergency in which she stood.One thing was sure; if that was the way I
must go, I had at least been taught how to tread it; and all through the
dizzy, blurred day that followed, I saw, as I sat at my work, repeated
visions of that stealthy, purposeful figure stealing down the stairs
and entering with uplifted pistol into the unconscious presence of my
employer.I even found myself a dozen times that day turning my eyes
upon the door through which it was to come, wondering how long it would
be before my actual form would pause there.That the moment was at hand
I did not imagine.Even when I left him that night after drinking with
him the glass of sherry mentioned at the inquest, I had no idea the hour
of action was so near.But when, not three minutes after going upstairs,
I caught the sound of a lady's dress rustling through the hall, and
listening, heard Mary Leavenworth pass my door on her way to the
library, I realized that the fatal hour was come; that something
was going to be said or done in that room which would make this deed
necessary.Casting about in my mind
for the means of doing so, I remembered that the ventilator running
up through the house opened first into the passage-way connecting Mr.Leavenworth's bedroom and library, and, secondly, into the closet of
the large spare room adjoining mine.Hastily unlocking the door of
the communication between the rooms, I took my position in the closet.Instantly the sound of voices reached my ears; all was open below, and
standing there, I was as much an auditor of what went on between Mary
and her uncle as if I were in the library itself.Enough to assure me my suspicions were correct; that it was a moment of
vital interest to her; that Mr.Leavenworth, in pursuance of a threat
evidently made some time since, was in the act of taking steps to change
his will, and that she had come to make an appeal to be forgiven her
fault and restored to his favor.What that fault was, I did not learn.I only heard her
declare that her action had been the result of impulse, rather than
love; that she regretted it, and desired nothing more than to be free
from all obligations to one she would fain forget, and be again to her
uncle what she was before she ever saw this man.I thought, fool that I
was, it was a mere engagement she was alluding to, and took the insanest
hope from these words; and when, in a moment later I heard her uncle
reply, in his sternest tone, that she had irreparably forfeited her
claims to his regard and favor, I did not need her short and bitter cry
of shame and disappointment, or that low moan for some one to help her,
for me to sound his death-knell in my heart.Creeping back to my own
room, I waited till I heard her reascend, then I stole forth.Calm as
I had ever been in my life, I went down the stairs just as I had seen
myself do in my dream, and knocking lightly at the library door, went
in.Leavenworth was sitting in his usual place writing."Excuse me," said I as he looked up, "I have lost my memorandum-book,
and think it possible I may have dropped it in the passage-way when I
went for the wine."He bowed, and I hurried past him into the closet.Once there, I proceeded rapidly into the room beyond, procured the
pistol, returned, and almost before I realized what I was doing, had
taken up my position behind him, aimed, and fired.Without a groan his head fell forward on his hands, and Mary
Leavenworth was the virtual possessor of the thousands she coveted.My first thought was to procure the letter he was writing.Approaching
the table, I tore it out from under his hands, looked at it, saw that
it was, as I expected, a summons to his lawyer, and thrust it into my
pocket, together with the letter from Mr.Clavering, which I perceived
lying spattered with blood on the table before me.Not till this was
done did I think of myself, or remember the echo which that low, sharp
report must have made in the house.Dropping the pistol at the side of
the murdered man, I stood ready to shriek to any one who entered that
Mr.But I was saved from committing such
a folly.The report had not been heard, or if so, had evidently failed
to create an alarm.No one came, and I was left to contemplate my
work undisturbed and decide upon the best course to be taken to avoid
detection.A moment's study of the wound made in his head by the
bullet convinced me of the impossibility of passing the affair off as
a suicide, or even the work of a burglar.To any one versed in such
matters it was manifestly a murder, and a most deliberate one.My one
hope, then, lay in making it as mysterious as it was deliberate, by
destroying all due to the motive and manner of the deed.Picking up the
pistol, I carried it into the other room with the intention of
cleaning it, but finding nothing there to do it with, came back for the
handkerchief I had seen lying on the floor at Mr.It
was Miss Eleanore's, but I did not know it till I had used it to clean
the barrel; then the sight of her initials in one corner so shocked me
I forgot to clean the cylinder, and only thought of how I could do
away with this evidence of her handkerchief having been employed for a
purpose so suspicious.Not daring to carry it from the room, I sought
for means to destroy it; but finding none, compromised the matter by
thrusting it deep down behind the cushion of one of the chairs, in the
hope of being able to recover and burn it the next day.This done, I
reloaded the pistol, locked it up, and prepared to leave the room.But here the horror which usually follows such deeds struck me like a
thunderbolt and made me for the first time uncertain in my action.I
locked the door on going out, something I should never have done.Not
till I reached the top of the stairs did I realize my folly; and then it
was too late, for there before me, candle in hand, and surprise written
on every feature of her face, stood Hannah, one of the servants, looking
at me."Lor, sir, where have you been?"she cried, but strange to say, in a
low tone."You look as if you had seen a ghost."And her eyes turned
suspiciously to the key which I held in my hand.I felt as if some one had clutched me round the throat.Thrusting the
key into my pocket, I took a step towards her."I will tell you what I
have seen if you will come down-stairs," I whispered; "the ladies will
be disturbed if we talk here," and smoothing my brow as best I could,
I put out my hand and drew her towards me.What my motive was I hardly
knew; the action was probably instinctive; but when I saw the look which
came into her face as I touched her, and the alacrity with which she
prepared to follow me, I took courage, remembering the one or two
previous tokens I had had of this girl's unreasonable susceptibility to
my influence; a susceptibility which I now felt could be utilized and
made to serve my purpose.Taking her down to the parlor floor, I drew her into the depths of
the great drawing-room, and there told her in the least alarming
way possible what had happened to Mr.She was of course
intensely agitated, but she did not scream;--the novelty of her position
evidently bewildering her--and, greatly relieved, I went on to say that
I did not know who committed the deed, but that folks would declare it
was I if they knew I had been seen by her on the stairs with the library
key in my hand."But I won't tell," she whispered, trembling violently
in her fright and eagerness.I will say I
didn't see anybody."But I soon convinced her that she could never keep
her secret if the police once began to question her, and, following
up my argument with a little cajolery, succeeded after a long while in
winning her consent to leave the house till the storm should be blown
over.But that given, it was some little time before I could make her
comprehend that she must depart at once and without going back after her
things.Not till I brightened up her wits by a promise to marry her some
day if she only obeyed me now, did she begin to look the thing in
the face and show any evidence of the real mother wit she evidently
possessed.Belden would take me in," said she, "if I could only
get to R----.She takes everybody in who asks, her; and she would
keep me, too, if I told her Miss Mary sent me.But I can't get there
to-night."I immediately set to work to convince her that she could.The midnight
train did not leave the city for a half-hour yet, and the distance to
the depot could be easily walked by her in fifteen minutes.And she was afraid she couldn't find
her way!She still hesitated, but
at length consented to go, and with some further understanding of the
method I was to employ in communicating with her, we went down-stairs.There we found a hat and shawl of the cook's which I put on her, and in
another moment we were in the carriage yard."Remember, you are to say
nothing of what has occurred, no matter what happens," I whispered in
parting injunction as she turned to leave me."Remember, you are to come
and marry me some day," she murmured in reply, throwing her arms about
my neck.The movement was sudden, and it was probably at this time she
dropped the candle she had unconsciously held clenched in her hand till
now.I promised her, and she glided out of the gate.Of the dreadful agitation that followed the disappearance of this girl
I can give no better idea than by saying I not only committed the
additional error of locking up the house on my re-entrance, but omitted
to dispose of the key then in my pocket by flinging it into the street
or dropping it in the hall as I went up.The fact is, I was so absorbed
by the thought of the danger I stood in from this girl, I forgot
everything else.Hannah's pale face, Hannah's look of terror, as she
turned from my side and flitted down the street, were continually before
me.I could not escape them; the form of the dead man lying below was
less vivid.It was as though I were tied in fancy to this woman of the
white face fluttering down the midnight streets.That she would fail in
something--come back or be brought back--that I should find her standing
white and horror-stricken on the front steps when I went down in the
morning, was like a nightmare to me.I began to think no other result
possible; that she never would or could win her way unchallenged to that
little cottage in a distant village; that I had but sent a trailing flag
of danger out into the world with this wretched girl;--danger that would
come back to me with the first burst of morning light!But even those thoughts faded after a while before the realization
of the peril I was in as long as the key and papers remained in my
possession.I dared not leave my room again,
or open my window.Indeed I was
afraid to move about in my room.Yes, my
morbid terror had reached that point--I was fearful of one whose ears I
myself had forever closed, imagined him in his bed beneath and wakeful
to the least sound.But the necessity of doing something with these evidences of guilt
finally overcame this morbid anxiety, and drawing the two letters from
my pocket--I had not yet undressed--I chose out the most dangerous of
the two, that written by Mr.Leavenworth himself, and, chewing it till
it was mere pulp, threw it into a corner; but the other had blood on it,
and nothing, not even the hope of safety, could induce me to put it
to my lips.I was forced to lie with it clenched in my hand, and the
flitting image of Hannah before my eyes, till the slow morning broke.I
have heard it said that a year in heaven seems like a day; I can easily
believe it.I know that an hour in hell seems an eternity!Whether it was that the sunshine glancing
on the wall made me think of Mary and all I was ready to do for her
sake, or whether it was the mere return of my natural stoicism in the
presence of actual necessity, I cannot say.I only know that I arose
calm and master of myself.The problem of the letter and key had solved
itself also.Instead of that I would
put them in plain sight, trusting to that very fact for their being
overlooked.Making the letter up into lighters, I carried them into the
spare room and placed them in a vase.Then, taking the key in my hand,
went down-stairs, intending to insert it in the lock of the library door
as I went by.But Miss Eleanore descending almost immediately behind me
made this impossible.I succeeded, however, in thrusting it, without
her knowledge, among the filagree work of the gas-fixture in the
second hall, and thus relieved, went down into the breakfast room as
self-possessed a man as ever crossed its threshold.Mary was there,
looking exceedingly pale and disheartened, and as I met her eye, which
for a wonder turned upon me as I entered, I could almost have laughed,
thinking of the deliverance that had come to her, and of the time when I
should proclaim myself to be the man who had accomplished it.Of the alarm that speedily followed, and my action at that time and
afterwards, I need not speak in detail.I behaved just as I would have
done if I had had no hand in the murder.I even forbore to touch the key
or go to the spare room, or make any movement which I was not willing
all the world should see.For as things stood, there was not a shadow
of evidence against me in the house; neither was I, a hard-working,
uncomplaining secretary, whose passion for one of his employer's nieces
was not even mistrusted by the lady herself, a person to be suspected
of the crime which threw him out of a fair situation.So I performed
all the duties of my position, summoning the police, and going for Mr.Veeley, just as I would have done if those hours between me leaving
Mr.Leavenworth for the first time and going down to breakfast in the
morning had been blotted from my consciousness.And this was the principle upon which I based my action at the inquest.Leaving that half-hour and its occurrences out of the question, I
resolved to answer such questions as might be put me as truthfully as
I could; the great fault with men situated as I was usually being that
they lied too much, thus committing themselves on unessential matters.But alas, in thus planning for my own safety, I forgot one thing,
and that was the dangerous position in which I should thus place Mary
Leavenworth as the one benefited by the crime.Not till the inference
was drawn by a juror, from the amount of wine found in Mr.Leavenworth's
glass in the morning, that he had come to his death shortly after my
leaving him, did I realize what an opening I had made for suspicion in
her direction by admitting that I had heard a rustle on the stair a few
minutes after going up.That all present believed it to have been made
by Eleanore, did not reassure me.She was so completely disconnected
with the crime I could not imagine suspicion holding to her for an
instant.But Mary--If a curtain had been let down before me, pictured
with the future as it has since developed, I could not have seen more
plainly what her position would be, if attention were once directed
towards her.So, in the vain endeavor to cover up my blunder, I began
to lie.Forced to admit that a shadow of disagreement had been lately
visible between Mr.Leavenworth and one of his nieces, I threw the
burden of it upon Eleanore, as the one best able to bear it.The
consequences were more serious than I anticipated.Direction had been
given to suspicion which every additional evidence that now came up
seemed by some strange fatality to strengthen.Leavenworth's own pistol had been used in the assassination,
and that too by a person then in the house, but I myself was brought
to acknowledge that Eleanore had learned from me, only a little while
before, how to load, aim, and fire this very pistol--a coincidence
mischievous enough to have been of the devil's own making.Seeing all this, my fear of what the ladies would admit when questioned
became very great.Let them in their innocence acknowledge that, upon my
ascent, Mary had gone to her uncle's room for the purpose of persuading
him not to carry into effect the action he contemplated, and what
consequences might not ensue!But events of which I had at that time no knowledge had occurred to
influence them.Eleanore, with some show of reason, as it seems, not
only suspected her cousin of the crime, but had informed her of the
fact, and Mary, overcome with terror at finding there was more or
less circumstantial evidence supporting the suspicion, decided to deny
whatever told against herself, trusting to Eleanore's generosity not to
be contradicted.Though, by the course
she took, Eleanore was forced to deepen the prejudice already rife
against herself, she not only forbore to contradict her cousin, but when
a true answer would have injured her, actually refused to return any,
a lie being something she could not utter, even to save one especially
endeared to her.This conduct of hers had one effect upon me.It aroused my admiration
and made me feel that here was a woman worth helping if assistance could
be given without danger to myself.Yet I doubt if my sympathy would have
led me into doing anything, if I had not perceived, by the stress laid
upon certain well-known matters, that actual danger hovered about us
all while the letter and key remained in the house.Even before the
handkerchief was produced, I had made up my mind to attempt their
destruction; but when that was brought up and shown, I became so alarmed
I immediately rose and, making my way under some pretence or other to
the floors above, snatched the key from the gas-fixture, the
lighters from the vase, and hastening with them down the hall to Mary
Leavenworth's room, went in under the expectation of finding a fire
there in which to destroy them.But, to my heavy disappointment, there
were only a few smoldering ashes in the grate, and, thwarted in my
design, I stood hesitating what to do, when I heard some one coming
up-stairs.Alive to the consequences of being found in that room at that
time, I cast the lighters into the grate and started for the door.But
in the quick move I made, the key flew from my hand and slid under a
chair.Aghast at the mischance, I paused, but the sound of approaching
steps increasing, I lost all control over myself and fled from the room.I had barely reached my own door when
Eleanore Leavenworth, followed by two servants, appeared at the top of
the staircase and proceeded towards the room I had just left.The sight
reassured me; she would see the key, and take some means of disposing
of it; and indeed I always supposed her to have done so, for no further
word of key or letter ever came to my ears.This may explain why the
questionable position in which Eleanore soon found herself awakened in
me no greater anxiety.I thought the suspicions of the police rested
upon nothing more tangible than the peculiarity of her manner at the
inquest and the discovery of her handkerchief on the scene of the
tragedy.I did not know they possessed what might be called absolute
proof of her connection with the crime.But if I had, I doubt if my
course would have been any different.Mary's peril was the one thing
capable of influencing me, and she did not appear to be in peril.On the
contrary, every one, by common consent, seemed to ignore all appearance
of guilt on her part.Gryce, whom I soon learned to fear, had
given one sign of suspicion, or Mr.Raymond, whom I speedily recognized
as my most persistent though unconscious foe, had betrayed the least
distrust of her, I should have taken warning.But they did not, and,
lulled into a false security by their manner, I let the days go by
without suffering any fears on her account.But not without many
anxieties for myself.Hannah's existence precluded all sense of personal
security.Knowing the determination of the police to find her, I trod
the verge of an awful suspense continually.Meantime the wretched certainty was forcing itself upon me that I had
lost, instead of gained, a hold on Mary Leavenworth.Not only did she
evince the utmost horror of the deed which had made her mistress of
her uncle's wealth, but, owing, as I believed, to the influence of Mr.Raymond, soon gave evidence that she was losing, to a certain extent,
the characteristics of mind and heart which had made me hopeful of
winning her by this deed of blood.Under the terrible restraint forced upon me, I walked my weary
round in a state of mind bordering on frenzy.Many and many a time have
I stopped in my work, wiped my pen and laid it down with the idea that
I could not repress myself another moment, but I have always taken it
up again and gone on with my task.Raymond has sometimes shown his
wonder at my sitting in my dead employer's chair.By keeping the murder constantly before my mind, I
was enabled to restrain myself from any inconsiderate action.At last there came a time when my agony could be no longer suppressed.Raymond, I saw a strange
gentleman standing in the reception room, looking at Mary Leavenworth
in a way that would have made my blood boil, even if I had not heard him
whisper these words: "But you are my wife, and know it, whatever you may
say or do!"It was the lightning-stroke of my life.After what I had done to make
her mine, to hear another claim her as already his own, was stunning,
maddening!I had either to yell in
my fury or deal the man beneath some tremendous blow in my hatred.I did
not dare to shriek, so I struck the blow.Raymond, and hearing that it was, as I expected, Clavering, I flung
caution, reason, common sense, all to the winds, and in a moment of fury
denounced him as the murderer of Mr.The next instant I would have given worlds to recall my words.What had
I done but drawn attention to myself in thus accusing a man against whom
nothing could of course be proved!So, after a night of thought, I did the next best thing: gave a
superstitious reason for my action, and so restored myself to my former
position without eradicating from the mind of Mr.Raymond that vague
doubt of the man which my own safety demanded.But I had no intention of
going any further, nor should I have done so if I had not observed that
for some reason Mr.But
that once seen, revenge took possession of me, and I asked myself if the
burden of this crime could be thrown on this man.Still I do not believe
that any active results would have followed this self-questioning if I
had not overheard a whispered conversation between two of the servants,
in which I learned that Mr.Clavering had been seen to enter the
house on the night of the murder, but was not seen to leave it.With such a fact for a starting-point, what might I not
hope to accomplish?While she remained
alive I saw nothing but ruin before me.I made up my mind to destroy
her and satisfy my hatred of Mr.By what
means could I reach her without deserting my post, or make away with
her without exciting fresh suspicion?The problem seemed insolvable;
but Trueman Harwell had not played the part of a machine so long without
result.Before I had studied the question a day, light broke upon it,
and I saw that the only way to accomplish my plans was to inveigle her
into destroying herself.No sooner had this thought matured than I hastened to act upon it.Knowing the tremendous risk I ran, I took every precaution.Locking
myself up in my room, I wrote her a letter in printed characters--she
having distinctly told me she could not read writing--in which I played
upon her ignorance, foolish fondness, and Irish superstition, by telling
her I dreamed of her every night and wondered if she did of me; was
afraid she didn't, so enclosed her a little charm, which, if she would
use according to directions, would give her the most beautiful visions.These directions were for her first to destroy my letter by burning it,
next to take in her hand the packet I was careful to enclose, swallow
the powder accompanying it, and go to bed.The powder was a deadly dose
of poison and the packet was, as you know, a forged confession falsely
criminating Henry Clavering.Enclosing all these in an envelope in
the corner of which I had marked a cross, I directed it, according to
agreement, to Mrs.Then followed the greatest period of suspense I had yet endured.Though
I had purposely refrained from putting my name to the letter, I felt
that the chances of detection were very great.Let her depart in the
least particular from the course I had marked out for her, and fatal
results must ensue.If she opened the enclosed packet, mistrusted the
powder, took Mrs.Belden into her confidence, or even failed to burn my
letter, all would be lost.I could not be sure of her or know the result
of my scheme except through the newspapers.Do you think I kept watch
of the countenances about me?devoured the telegraphic news, or started
when the bell rang?And when, a few days since, I read that short
paragraph in the paper which assured me that my efforts had at least
produced the death of the woman I feared, do you think I experienced any
sense of relief?In six hours had come the summons from Mr.Gryce,
and--let these prison walls, this confession itself, tell the rest.I am
no longer capable of speech or action.THE OUTCOME OF A GREAT CRIME


    "Leave her to Heaven
    And to those thorns that
    In her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her."--Hamlet

    "For she is wise, if I can judge of her;
    And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true;
    And true she is, as she has proved herself;
    And therefore like herself, wise, fair, and true,
    Shall she be placed in my constant soul."I cried, as I made my way into her presence, "are you
prepared for very good news?News that will brighten these pale cheeks
and give the light back to these eyes, and make life hopeful and sweet
to you once more?Tell me," I urged, stooping over her where she sat,
for she looked ready to faint."I don't know," she faltered; "I fear your idea of good news and mine
may differ.No news can be good but----"

"What?"I asked, taking her hands in mine with a smile that ought to
have reassured her, it was one of such profound happiness."Tell me; do
not be afraid."Her dreadful burden had lain upon her so long it had become
a part of her being.How could she realize it was founded on a mistake;
that she had no cause to fear the past, present, or future?But when the truth was made known to her; when, with all the fervor and
gentle tact of which I was capable, I showed her that her suspicions had
been groundless, and that Trueman Harwell, and not Mary, was accountable
for the evidences of crime which had led her into attributing to her
cousin the guilt of her uncle's death, her first words were a prayer to
be taken to the one she had so wronged.I cannot breathe or think till I have begged pardon of her on my
knees.Seeing the state she was in, I deemed it wise to humor her.So,
procuring a carriage, I drove with her to her cousin's home."Mary will spurn me; she will not even look at me; and she will be
right!"she cried, as we rolled away up the avenue."An outrage like
this can never be forgiven.But God knows I thought myself justified in
my suspicions.If you knew--"

"I do know," I interposed."Mary acknowledges that the circumstantial
evidence against her was so overwhelming, she was almost staggered
herself, asking if she could be guiltless with such proofs against her.But----"

"Wait, oh, wait; did Mary say that?"I did not answer; I wanted her to see for herself the extent of that
change.But when, in a few minutes later, the carriage stopped and I
hurried with her into the house which had been the scene of so much
misery, I was hardly prepared for the difference in her own countenance
which the hall light revealed.Her eyes were bright, her cheeks were
brilliant, her brow lifted and free from shadow; so quickly does the ice
of despair melt in the sunshine of hope.Thomas, who had opened the door, was sombrely glad to see his mistress
again."Miss Leavenworth is in the drawing-room," said he.I nodded, then seeing that Eleanore could scarcely move for agitation,
asked her whether she would go in at once, or wait till she was more
composed."I will go in at once; I cannot wait."And slipping from my grasp, she
crossed the hall and laid her hand upon the drawing-room curtain, when
it was suddenly lifted from within and Mary stepped out.I did not need to glance their
way to know that Eleanore had fallen at her cousin's feet, and that
her cousin had affrightedly lifted her.I did not need to hear: "My sin
against you is too great; you cannot forgive me!"followed by the low:
"My shame is great enough to lead me to forgive anything!"to know that
the lifelong shadow between these two had dissolved like a cloud, and
that, for the future, bright days of mutual confidence and sympathy were
in store.Yet when, a half-hour or so later, I heard the door of the reception
room, into which I had retired, softly open, and looking up, saw Mary
standing on the threshold, with the light of true humility on her face,
I own that I was surprised at the softening which had taken place in
her haughty beauty."Blessed is the shame that purifies," I inwardly
murmured, and advancing, held out my hand with a respect and sympathy I
never thought to feel for her again.Blushing deeply, she came and stood by
my side."I have much to be grateful for; how
much I never realized till to-night; but I cannot speak of it now.What
I wish is for you to come in and help me persuade Eleanore to accept
this fortune from my hands.It is hers, you know; was willed to her, or
would have been if--"

"Wait," said I, in the trepidation which this appeal to me on such a
subject somehow awakened.Is it your
determined purpose to transfer your fortune into your cousin's hands?"Her look was enough without the low, "Ah, how can you ask me?"Clavering was sitting by the side of Eleanore when we entered the
drawing-room.He immediately rose, and drawing me to one side, earnestly
said:

"Before the courtesies of the hour pass between us, Mr.Raymond, allow
me to tender you my apology.You have in your possession a document
which ought never to have been forced upon you.Founded upon a mistake,
the act was an insult which I bitterly regret.If, in consideration of
my mental misery at that time, you can pardon it, I shall feel forever
indebted to you; if not----"

"Mr.The occurrences of that day belong to
a past which I, for one, have made up my mind to forget as soon as
possible.The future promises too richly for us to dwell on bygone
miseries."And with a look of mutual understanding and friendship we hastened to
rejoin the ladies.Of the conversation that followed, it is only necessary to state the
result.Eleanore, remaining firm in her refusal to accept property so
stained by guilt, it was finally agreed upon that it should be devoted
to the erection and sustainment of some charitable institution of
magnitude sufficient to be a recognized benefit to the city and its
unfortunate poor.This settled, our thoughts returned to our friends,
especially to Mr."He has grieved like a father over us."And, in her spirit of penitence, she would have undertaken the unhappy
task of telling him the truth.But Eleanore, with her accustomed generosity, would not hear of this."No, Mary," said she; "you have suffered enough.And leaving them there, with the light of growing hope and confidence on
their faces, we went out again into the night, and so into a dream from
which I have never waked, though the shine of her dear eyes have been
now the load-star of my life for many happy, happy months.Copious bleeding usually follows these
incisions, often followed by marked diminution in the volume of the
organ.Deep as these cuts appear when made, they become quite shallow
before the organ has shrunk to its normal volume.Bleeding from the
ranular veins, recommended by some practitioners in preference to
incisions into the organ, is often impracticable on account of the
tumefaction preventing access to them.If severe hemorrhage takes place from divided vessels, the vessels may
be subjected to torsion, which is the preferable mode of management, or
to searing with some form of the incandescent cautery (hot iron,
electric cautery, Paquelin's thermo-cautery).Astringent and chemical
styptics are of little use.The method of searing is open to the
objection that secondary hemorrhage may ensue on detachment of the
eschars, but this accident is not likely to happen under circumstances
at all favorable.In localized or circumscribed glossitis the incision to be made should
interest the swollen portion only.Should the tongue swell again, the incisions may be repeated.Whether
the tongue require incision or not, it is good treatment to have the
patient inhale vapor from hot vinegar, alcohol, or cologne spirits to
render the parts more comfortable.Washes of weak detergent solutions
containing potassium nitrate, sodium borate, or ammonium chloride may
be used by syringe or spray to cleanse the parts and promote detachment
of the epithelial coatings on the tongue and interior of the mouth, the
accumulations of which are sometimes matters of great annoyance.The
drug last mentioned exerts in addition a special action on the
inflammatory process which is often quite serviceable.I have seen good
results follow the prolonged use of sprays of an aqueous solution of
ammonium chloride (Stuver), one drachm to the ounce, from the
steam-spray apparatus, continued for fifteen to twenty minutes at a
time and repeated every two or three hours.In many instances the patient is unable to take food by the mouth.The
best plan under such circumstances is to pass a catheter into the
stomach through the larger of the two nasal passages, and retain it in
position unless its presence interferes too much with respiration.Milk
and stimulus can then be poured into the stomach from time to time with
the aid of a funnel passed into the outer opening of the tube, which
should be kept corked during the intervals when retained in position.This failing or impracticable, it will be necessary to nourish the
patient with enemata.On the appearance of abscess the same should be freely laid open.In
cases of hesitation, the true nature of the presumable abscess can be
{366} determined beforehand with the exploring-needle.The pus from an
abscess of this kind is rarely copious and is usually fetid.It would
be good practice to distend the sac after discharge of pus by injecting
into it a solution of carbolic acid.In resisting or advanced cases of suppurative inflammation of the
planes of connective tissue between the muscles at the lower portion of
the root of the tongue, Fleming recommends a free incision under the
chin in the middle line, through skin and fasciae and on through the
raphe of the muscles themselves.In cases of gangrene, washes, douches, or sprays of carbolic acid,
chlorinated soda, hydrogen peroxide, or potassium permanganate are
indicated to relieve fetor; while the most supporting treatment by
mouth or otherwise is requisite on general principles.Chronic glossitis, like acute glossitis, may be superficial or
parenchymatous.Superficial chronic glossitis is usually confined to the papillae of
the tongue, territories of which, so to speak, are mapped out on the
surface of the tongue, separated by furrows reaching to the basement
mucous membrane.In pronounced cases the dividing furrows are quite
deep, giving the organ a mamelonnated appearance, and they penetrate
into the mucous membrane (dissecting glossitis, Wunderlich), which
becomes subjected to great irritation by the retention of articles of
food in the fissures.Demarquay[70] has recorded a case of this kind in
which, to relieve the intense sufferings with which the patient had
been plagued for a number of years, he had been forced to amputate the
anterior half of the organ--an operation which succeeded thoroughly.In another group of cases the surface of the swollen tongue is mapped
out in small ovoid patches, smooth, red, and glossy, from which the
papillae have become separated without regeneration.Sometimes chronic
glossitis presents as an aphthous inflammation.Sometimes superficial
ulcers occur upon the dorsum of the tongue, irritable, indolent, and
indurated.ETIOLOGY.--Chronic superficial glossitis is in rare instances a sequel
of the acute form of the disease.Usually, however, it is encountered
as a chronic affection from the outset, so to speak, generally as a
result of long-continued irritation in connection with dyspepsia and
other gastric and gastro-intestinal disorders.It is frequently
encountered in subjects of chronic alcoholism.The superficial ulcerations often occur at the sides of the organ,
usually in some of the depressions formed by the contact of the teeth.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The symptoms are those due to a consciousness that the
tongue is too large, with occasional pain in taking acid and succulent
food.{367} PATHOLOGY.--The pathology does not differ from that of chronic
inflammations elsewhere.The apparent obliteration of the papillae in
some cases is due to a filling up of the intervening furrows by
permanent deposit of new-formed cells.The excoriations and superficial
ulcerations are most frequently due to disturbance of nutrition by
pressure.DIAGNOSIS.--The affection may be confounded with syphilitic disease of
the tongue or with papillary epithelioma, but the history of the case,
the resistance to antisyphilitic treatment, and the negative results
from microscopic examination of fragments of tissue removed for the
purpose, serve to establish the diagnosis in cases of doubt.It must
not be forgotten, however, that many cases of epithelioma begin in
chronic glossitis, non-specific as well as syphilitic.PROGNOSIS.--Though not threatening to life, the prognosis of the
disease itself is bad.It resists treatment, being, in fact, a
complication of some obstinate or intractable gastric or
gastro-intestinal disorder, or an evidence of constitutional dyscrasia.Cure may be expected in recent cases, following cure of the dyspepsia
or other malady upon which the chronic glossitis may be dependent.TREATMENT.--Care to cleanse the tongue by washes, douches, or wet
cloths after each meal, in order to remove particles of food which may
have become impacted in the anfractuosities of the organ, is important
in order to avoid additional sources of irritation.Astringents and caustics of various kinds have been extensively
employed, carefully applied to the floors of the fissures, but it is
very rarely that any benefit ensues.Demarquay[71] reports good results
in one case of dissecting papillary glossitis from biweekly
applications of equal parts of chromic acid and water.Butlin reports
good results from chromic acid (1:10).Careful attention to the gastro-intestinal functions, and a thorough
change of diet, such as the adoption of the milk cure and the like,
with due attention to bathing and outdoor exercise, comprise the most
rational method of constitutional treatment.Should the secretions of
the mouth give an acid reaction with litmus-paper, alkalies are
strongly indicated, topically and systemically.Avoidance of alcohol in
all forms is often absolutely essential.Chronic Parenchymatous Glossitis.The chronic parenchymatous form of glossitis is usually circumscribed.When diffuse or general it has usually been a sequel of acute
parenchymatous glossitis.It is not a painful disorder, and as a rule
is not associated with constitutional manifestations.The circumscribed
tumefaction usually presents as an induration upon some portion of the
side of the tongue, being most frequently directly or indirectly due to
irritation sustained from a jagged tooth.Ordinary sensibility is much
diminished, and sometimes the sense of taste likewise.Sometimes the
indurated mass is ulcerated superficially.The enlargement of the organ
is not sufficient to keep it outside the mouth.Sometimes, indeed, the
tongue, {368} as a whole, has undergone atrophy, unilateral or
bilateral.Chronic abscess of the tongue sometimes supervenes, chiefly
in scrofulous subjects.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--This consists merely in interstitial
connective-tissue hyperplasia, with atrophy of muscular fibres from
compression.SYMPTOMS.--In addition to the objective symptoms of induration or
circumscribed tumefaction, the subjective symptoms may be summed up as
general hypersensitiveness to sapid and acrid substances; diminished
tactile sensibility at the part affected; slight stinging sensations
while the parts are at rest; occasional or continuous local pains; and
a sense of impediment in the movements of the tongue in articulation
and even in deglutition.DIAGNOSIS.--Inspection reveals the swelling, and palpation its
induration.In addition, the adjacent source of irritation, a jagged
tooth or two, is seen.Abscess is recognized by special prominence at
one point of the swelling and by indistinct sense of fluctuation.Cystic tumor is liable to be mistaken for abscess, but the
exploring-needle will solve the difficulty.Circumscribed induration
may be confounded with tumor or with epithelioma.PROGNOSIS.--This is good, provided the source of irritation can be
removed or suppressed.TREATMENT.--The first element in the treatment is the removal or repair
of any offending tooth, and next attention to any underlying malady,
constitutional or local.Weak solutions of iodine locally are said to
be of service.Their walls
should be distended with solutions of carbolic acid or be touched with
solutions of iodine, silver nitrate, or cupric sulphate, to promote
reparative inflammation.Glossanthrax (Carbuncle of the Tongue, Malignant Pustule of the
Tongue).This is a special variety of gangrenous ulcerative glossitis,
presenting as an integral phenomenon of a disease peculiar to
slaughterers, who become infected from diseased cattle, usually by
means of the knife, which they are sometimes in the habit of holding in
the mouth (Heyfelder and others).It has been described chiefly by
Heyfelder,[72] Duhamel, Chavarrien d'Audebert, Felix Plata, Breschet et
Finot, and Maisonneuve.[73]

[Footnote 72: _Med.Vereins Zeitung_, 1834.][Footnote 73: _Des Tumeurs de la Langue_, Paris, 1848, These de
Concours.]The period of incubation occupies about one day.The tongue then
undergoes rapid tumefaction and becomes the seat of intense pain.The
points of inoculation become hard, covered with vesicles containing
bloody serum, which blacken, rupture, and leave dark, livid, gangrenous
patches of ulceration.Profound cachexia rapidly ensues under typhoid
manifestations, and death may result in less than twenty-four hours,
though usually not until sixty hours.The prognosis, therefore, is of
the gravest character.The chief treatment consists in thorough cauterization of the
inoculated {369} points by means of the actual cautery, followed by
deep incisions into the body of the tongue if the glossitis be severe.Apart from the ulcerations of the tongue incidentally mentioned in the
foregoing pages, there are two forms of ulcer, both of sufficiently
frequent occurrence in ordinary practice to require special
description: these are the tuberculous ulcer and the syphilitic ulcer.Tuberculous Ulcer of the Tongue.--Tuberculous ulceration of the tongue
occurs in a certain number of cases of advanced tuberculosis of the
lungs or of the lungs and larynx.It has even been asserted to precede
pulmonary tuberculosis.It is most frequently observed upon the upper
surface of one side of the organ, sometimes at the tip, sometimes
farther back, and usually on the same side upon which the disease is
most advanced in the lungs or the larynx.It is often associated with
previous or subsequent tuberculous ulcerations of the palate or of the
pharynx or contiguous structures.It gradually extends, and rarely if
ever heals.It is characterized by a superficial excavation, and by
being covered with a grayish detritus entirely different from the
purulent layers seen on other kinds of ulcers.When of long standing
its base is indurated, and this may give rise at first to suspicion of
squamous-celled carcinoma.Small yellowish elevations are sometimes
observed in the reddened mucous membrane around the ulcer--an
appearance deemed sometimes characteristic of the tuberculous nature of
the lesion (Trelat[74]).de Med._, 1869, or _Arch.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Nodular tuberculous infiltration takes
place beneath the mucous membrane, which becomes elevated in small,
semiglobular, yellow protuberances of one or more millimeters in
diameter, around which the mucous membrane is red and swollen.The
epithelium becomes shed without undergoing renewal, and thus a little
point of superficial ulceration remains.When several such points are
sufficiently contiguous they coalesce into a single ulcer of irregular
contour, which gradually spreads without much other change.SYMPTOMS.--In addition to the superficial ulceration described, and in
addition to the constitutional and local symptoms of advanced
tuberculosis of the lungs or lungs and larynx, as may be, there are no
special symptoms attending the tuberculous ulcer of the tongue.Saliva
is sometimes secreted in excess, but that is not characteristic.There
is little pain and little impediment to the movements of the tongue
until the disease has advanced.DIAGNOSIS.--The presence in a tuberculous subject of a unilateral,
irregular ulcer of the tongue surmounted with grayish detritus and
surrounded by reddened edges, should suffice for the recognition of its
presumptive tuberculous character.It is most difficult perhaps to
differentiate from a small ulcerated squamous-celled carcinoma, and the
two indeed sometimes coexist, rendering the discrimination extremely
difficult until the advanced progress of the carcinoma places the
diagnosis beyond doubt.{370} In the early stages, however, it is distinguished by lack of the
peculiar lancinating pains of carcinoma, which, however, are not
invariably attendant, and by lack of secondary involvements of the
cervical lymphatic glands.At all times it should be distinguishable
from the carcinomatous ulcer by lack of the fungus-like appearance of
the bed of the ulcer which is usual in carcinoma.From syphilitic ulcer it is distinguishable by the history of the case,
its tendency to be unilateral, and its failure to respond to
antisyphilitic treatment.Syphilitic ulceration of the tongue may
represent the primary, the secondary, or the tertiary manifestation of
the specific disease.The former will not be discussed in this
connection.Secondary ulcers occur on the upper surface of the tongue, most
frequently at the anterior portion, as fissures, usually longitudinal,
the floors of which are ulcerated.They occur likewise at the sides,
tip, and even lower surface of the organ.They are often associated
with secondary ulceration in the mucous membrane of some portion of the
mouth.They are quite painful, especially to the contact of pungent
articles of food.Some ulcers occur as simple superficial excoriations
at some portion of the edge or tip of the tongue, giving little
evidence of any specific character.Tertiary ulcers are usually sequelae of gummata.They are much deeper
than secondary ulcers, sanious at bottom, often serpiginous in
configuration, and apt to extend in depth as well as in superficies,
sometimes penetrating through and through the organ.They are most
frequent in the very central portion of the tongue, or are
symmetrically disposed on either side of it.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of tuberculous ulceration is bad, both as
regards tongue and patient.TREATMENT.--The only topical treatment offering any prospect of local
cure is the bodily destruction of the ulcer and the surrounding tissue
with caustics, the best of which are the incandescent metals, or else
the excision, with the incandescent knife, of a portion of the tongue
comprising all the affected tissue.In the former case the tuberculous
process often reappears about the cicatrix; in the latter, at some more
distant point.Tincture of iodine locally, detergent washes, and the like, often
secure a certain amount of comfort as palliatives.The same indications
prevail as in simple chronic glossitis, superficial and deep-seated.Iodoform locally is of benefit, inasmuch as it relieves pain and
reduces collateral inflammation, but it is powerless to arrest the
onward march of the ulcerative process.DEFINITION.--A loss of blood from the mouth.SYNONYM.--Stomatorrhagia.ETIOLOGY.--Hemorrhage from the mouth is usually a symptom of some
disease or injury of the mouth, tongue, gums, palate, pharynx, or nose.It may, however, occur as one of the phenomena of scorbutus or of
haemophilia.It is said to occur occasionally as a vicarious {371}
menstruation.It may be slight, so as barely to tinge the saliva, or it
may be profuse enough to terminate fatally.Between these extremes
there is an infinity of gradations.As a result of disease it may be
caused by simple hyperaemia of the mucous membrane, by rupture of
dilated blood-vessels, by ulceration, by gangrene.As a result of
injury it may arise from wounds of various kinds, accidental or
self-inflicted.The gums are the most frequent source of slight hemorrhage from the
mouth.The pharynx, probably, is the next most frequent seat.Hemorrhage from the tongue, cheeks, lips, and palate is usually
traumatic or the result of ulceration.SYMPTOMATOLOGY, COURSE, DURATION, COMPLICATIONS, TERMINATIONS, AND
SEQUELAE.--The symptoms of hemorrhage from the mouth are the presence
of blood in the saliva or in the mouth itself, or in the expelled
products of expectoration, emesis, or catharsis, for sometimes the
blood is swallowed, and occasionally inhaled into the air-passages.The
course, duration, complications, and terminations of stomatorrhagia
depend upon its cause.Prolonged hemorrhage will entail anaemia;
profuse hemorrhage may terminate fatally.DIAGNOSIS.--Careful examination of the mouth, tongue, pharynx, and
posterior nares, both by direct and by reflected light, may be
necessary to discover the source of the hemorrhage and discriminate it
from haemoptysis and haematemesis.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis will depend upon the nature of the cause, its
susceptibility of arrest, the quantity of blood lost, and the general
health of the patient.It is grave, as a rule, in the subjects of
haemophilia, as there is a constitutional malnutrition of the
blood-vessel system which cannot be counteracted.TREATMENT.--Ergot or oil of turpentine internally, astringent
mouth-washes, and recumbency constitute the main features in treatment.DEFINITION.--Departure from the physiological processes concerned in
the eruption of teeth, entailing certain local and systemic disorders.SYNONYMS.--Dentitio difficilis, Pathological dentition, Odontitis
infantum.The correct comprehension of the subject will be facilitated by
considering its etiology, pathology, and symptomatology in connection.Indeed, morbid dentition has been assigned so prominent a part in the
etiology of various affections elsewhere discussed that a satisfactory
consideration of its own causation would require the repetition of much
that belongs more appropriately under other titles.While in some
infants the teeth erupt so quietly that the parents are astonished by
the accidental discovery of their presence above the gum, few children
escape a greater or less amount of local and constitutional disturbance
while passing through the process of dentition.So severe may these
disturbances become that, according to the mortality-tables of London,
as cited by West,[75] teething was assigned as the cause of death of
4.8 per cent.of all children dying under one year old, and of 7.3 per
cent.of those who died between the {372} ages of twelve months and
three years.It is furthermore well recognized that the period of
greatest mortality among children is that of the first dentition.Associating these facts, we see, on the one hand, that while disorders
of dentition may act a causative part in the production of systemic
diseases or aggravate morbid processes due to ordinary causes, on the
other hand they may be but one expression of some profound
constitutional disturbance; or both aberration in the eruption of the
teeth and systemic disease may be dependent upon the influence of
dyscrasia.The period is one of active organic processes; the child is
becoming fitted for a new manner of existence; and change and
development are going on throughout nervous, vascular, respiratory, and
alimentary systems.Hence there exists peculiar susceptibility to
morbid influences; and any process, physiological or pathological, once
started, goes through its stages with excessive energy.[Footnote 75: _Lectures on the Diseases of Infancy and Childhood_,
Philada., 1860, p.Although the periods of normal eruption of the deciduous teeth vary
within extensive limits, and an invariable order in eruption is not
observed in all subjects, it may be stated as a rule that the lower
central incisors are cut in quick succession about the seventh month.Some infants get these teeth during the fourth month (Vogel), and
others have to wait until the tenth or eleventh month, some even
longer.A few weeks after the appearance of these lower
incisors--within fourteen days in some subjects, not until nine or more
weeks in others--the central incisors of the upper jaw are cut, and its
lateral incisors shortly afterward, followed in their turn by the
lateral incisors of the lower jaw.In some instances--the majority,
according to Vogel--the eruption of the inferior lateral incisors is
delayed until the anterior molars are about to become exposed, usually
from the twelfth to the fifteenth month.Sometimes the upper molars are
cut before the lower, sometimes after them.From the sixteenth to the
twentieth, or even the twenty-fourth, month the canine teeth are cut,
and the four posterior molars follow between the twentieth and
thirtieth months, rarely delayed until the thirty-sixth
month,--completing the process of the first dentition.From this it will be seen that the teeth erupt as a rule in pairs, and
that a longer or shorter interval of repose takes place between the
eruption of successive pairs.Variations from the usual order beyond the limits noted above may be
considered abnormal.Numerous cases are on record both of precipitate
and of tardy dentition.Tanner cites from Haller nineteen examples in
which one or more of the central incisors have been found through the
gums at birth, and have had to be removed to prevent injury to the
mother's nipple; from Crump, a case of full dentition at birth,
reported to the Virginia Society of Dentists; and from Ashburner, a
case of a child beginning to cut its first tooth, an incisor in the
upper jaw, during its twenty-third month, the infant being very
delicate, with a large head, tumid abdomen, and peculiarly small-sized
extremities.The same author quotes from Serres cases of persons
passing through several years of life--in one instance seven--before
cutting their first teeth, and mentions on the authority of Tomes that
Boxalli and Baumes have each recorded an instance in which the patient
reached old age without a single tooth having ever appeared.Rachitis is often the cause of tardy dentition, and in the subjects of
this {373} diathesis not alone are the teeth retarded in development,
but they decay early and even fall from their sockets.The first indication of approaching dentition is the markedly increased
production of saliva.For some little time after birth the salivary
glands seem to remain wholly inactive, and until the fourth or fifth
month of extra-uterine life they furnish very little secretion.The mouth is constantly filled with
saliva, which dribbles from its corners.To this continual slobbering,
wetting the garments covering the chest, has been attributed the
bronchial catarrh which attends some infants; and diarrhoea has
likewise been referred to the swallowing of large quantities of saliva,
acting as a mild laxative by virtue of its saline constituents.There may be no further manifestation until the seventh month, beyond
the broadening of the dental ridge.The exact position of each tooth is
usually indicated by greater prominence of the gum above it for some
time before it comes through, its entire outline being very distinct in
the upper central incisors.As the tooth approaches the surface the gum
becomes hot, shining, tense, and tumid, often painful.A slight amount
of catarrhal stomatitis is almost invariable.There is some elevation
of temperature; flushing of the cheek may occur; the child is restless,
peevish, and fretful; its sleep may be broken; it may cry out with
pain; its thumb, its fingers, any hard substance it can obtain, are
thrust into its mouth to allay the irritation of the gums.Otalgia is
not uncommon, and its occurrence may be inferred from the fact that the
child pokes its thumb or finger into the auditory canal or firmly
presses the tragus down over the external meatus.These may comprise
all the disordered manifestations, local or constitutional, or there
may be in addition loss of appetite, diarrhoea, vomiting, and the
various disturbances of reflex nervous origin to be alluded to later;
or, in the not common yet not rare instances already mentioned, there
may be absolutely no appreciable disturbance whatever.Sometimes a disposition exists to the formation of small aphthous
ulcerations on the tongue or elsewhere in the mouth, particularly at
the duplicature of the lip and the outer surface of the alveoli.Ulceration occurs most frequently at the tip of the tongue, probably
occasioned by friction from the new teeth.Usually there is a single
flat, round ulcer, its edges somewhat infiltrated, its bed covered with
a yellow lardaceous substance.It is extremely painful to the touch,
and thus every movement of the tongue occasions distress.It may heal
within a few days or continue for weeks.Ulcers in other situations are
less obstinate.Occasionally--and more frequently in debilitated subjects or those
exposed to unhygienic surroundings--there is an unusual amount of heat
and swelling of the gum, which becomes excessively tender, usually over
the summit of a particular tooth--in which case there will be a little
tumor-like elevation--or around a tooth which has partially pierced
through it.Small sloughy ulcerations form in this situation.There is
great pain, and usually high fever and severe gastro-intestinal
disorder.This affection, often difficult of cure, is termed by some
writers odontitis infantum.So severe is the pain, and so great its
tendency to aggravate constitutional disturbances, that life may be
placed in jeopardy, and even fatal results ensue.{374} Less severe than either of the forms just described, and yet far
more intense than the mild stomatitis which many authors regard as
physiological, is an aggravated form of catarrhal stomatitis sometimes
attendant upon morbid dentition, in which there is swelling of the
submaxillary glands and infiltration of the adjacent connective tissue.In this case there is usually considerable pyrexia.The constitutional disturbances of reflex nervous origin occasioned by
morbid dentition are of the most varied character, both in their degree
of gravity and in the manner and locality of their manifestation.Doubtless the extensive ramifications of the great vagus nerve, and its
connections both of origin and distribution with the exquisitely
sensitive fifth nerve, as well as with the facial nerve and with the
sympathetic system, will explain why the irritation should now be
seated in the gastro-intestinal tract, giving rise to vomiting and
diarrhoea (gastritis, gastro-enteritis, enteritis, entero-colitis,
cholera infantum); now in the respiratory tract, provoking cough more
or less severe, or even a well-marked bronchitis; now manifest itself
in various cutaneous eruptions (urticaria, eczema, impetigo, lichen,
prurigo, herpes); and now accumulate in the cerebro-spinal axis,
manifesting its presence by slight spasms (dysuria, muscular
twitchings), or discharging with terrific force in some of those
convulsive seizures which are the dread of mothers and the cause of
much anxiety to physicians.The mechanical causation of diarrhoea and bronchitis, insisted upon
particularly by Vogel, has already been alluded to.While this may be
one element, most certainly the nervous factor is too important to be
disregarded.Bronchitis, not attributable to ordinary exposure, occurs
coincidently with teething even in children who have been protected
against wetting of the chest; and the fact that more purely nervous
phenomena, and especially the dreaded brain symptoms, are usually
absent in children who have an excessive flow of saliva, and
particularly if there be also a moderate diarrhoea, would conduce to
the belief that nervous irritation, discharging itself in this manner,
does not accumulate in the centres.Doubts have been expressed whether dentition can give rise to
convulsions in perfectly healthy children, although its role as an
exciting cause in predisposed subjects is admitted (Hillier).That
dentition alone, in the absence of any other predisposing or exciting
influence, will provoke any of the disorders with which it is
associated may be doubted in view of the fact already cited, that in
some infants there are no untoward occurrences.But there seems to be
no valid reason for separating the disturbances purely in the domain of
the nervous system from the other pathological processes originated or
aggravated by morbid dentition.Doubtless predisposition often
determines the direction and severity of the reflected phenomena; and
in the same manner reflected irritation may bring an organ within the
influence of the ordinary disease-producing cause.The convulsive phenomena associated with dentition may take the form of
general eclampsia or spasms of particular groups of muscles.These
latter are very common--according to Vogel, universal--and vary in
intensity from that slight contraction of the facial muscles which
sends the mother into raptures of delight over the heavenly smile of
her {375} sleeping babe to the distressing seizure of laryngismus
stridulus.Sometimes the child may sleep with its eyes half open, the
eyeballs directed upward, and only the white sclerotic to be seen
through the gap between the lids, "producing an appearance which is
unnatural and alarming to the laity."The attacks of general eclampsia are usually sudden.The child has been
to all appearances perfectly healthy, when, without warning, there
occurs a series of tetanic spasms like a succession of electric shocks.The individual eclamptic shock cannot be distinguished from an
epileptic seizure.These convulsions sometimes continue for several
days, but frequently they cease after a few minutes.They may pass off
and leave nothing to testify to their occurrence; very frequently they
occasion permanent distressing lesions.Partial, so-called essential
paralyses, squint, or even idiocy, are cited among their sequelae;
infants subject to repeated convulsions while cutting successive teeth
have eventually perished from cerebro-spinal meningitis; death has not
infrequently been an immediate result.In these graver cases teething
is probably but one of the morbid influences at work.Purulent otitis media follows dentition in some infants, usually, if
not invariably, of a scrofulous diathesis.At the clinic of the
Jefferson Medical College Hospital fully one-third of all the cases of
otorrhoea in children are said to be so occasioned.Blennorrhoeal conjunctivitis is a rare complication of teething, and
when it occurs usually accompanies the eruption of the upper molars and
canines (eye teeth).It is attributed to direct extension of the
gingival inflammation by continuity through the antrum of Highmore and
the nasal passages.By some it is said to occur only in strumous
subjects.It is unilateral, and is not contagious, so that there is no
cause for alarm concerning the unaffected eye.The lids soon swell
enormously and the eyeball is exposed with difficulty.The secretion is more mucous, translucent, and
stringy than in genuine blennorrhoea.The eyeball always remains intact
and the prognosis is always favorable (Vogel).Milder forms of
catarrhal conjunctivitis are not very uncommon.Thus far, we have considered only the process of the first dentition.Before the shedding of any of the deciduous teeth, the first permanent
molars inaugurate the second dentition, appearing in position at about
the sixth year.Next, displacing their temporary predecessors, come the
central incisors, between the sixth and eighth years, the inferior pair
generally preceding the superior ones.The lateral incisors are cut
between the seventh and ninth years; the anterior bicuspids between the
ninth and tenth years; the posterior bicuspids between the tenth and
eleventh years; the canines between the eleventh and thirteenth years;
the second molars between the twelfth and fourteenth years; the third
molars, or wisdom teeth, between the seventeenth and twenty-first years
as a rule, occasionally much earlier, sometimes later.The eruption of the permanent teeth does not usually occasion any very
great amount of distress; nevertheless, it sometimes acts both as a
predisposing and as an exciting cause of various disorders, local and
systemic.The various forms of stomatitis, tonsillitis, sore throat,
gastro-intestinal derangements, febrile disturbances, bronchitis,
internal rhinitis, {376} diseases of the eye, of the ear, of the skin,
chorea, epilepsy, etc., have all been noted as accompanying, if not
occasioned by, the second dentition.Ashburner[76] records, among other
similar instances, that of a lad twelve years old who presented a
marked case of chorea, and after three months' continuance of the
twitchings fell into a violent epileptic fit, from difficulty in the
eruption of the second pair of permanent molars of the upper jaw.The
use of the gum lancet relieved the convulsion, and there was no return
of the chorea.[Footnote 76: _On Dentition and some Coincident Disorders_, London,
1834, cited by Tanner.]Quite frequently, the eruption of the inferior dentes sapientiae
occasions great and protracted suffering, especially when they appear
very close to or partially under the coronoid processes.Considerable
irritation is occasioned, in which the gums and adjacent tissues
participate.Inflammation may result and extend to the fauces;
mastication becomes impossible; severe odynphagia is excited.Suppuration may ensue, and then the pus burrows in various directions,
finding exit at points more or less remote, internal or external.Among
the consequences of the eruption of a wisdom tooth into a crowded arch,
White[77] cites fistulae, necrosis, exostosis, ulceration and sloughing
of the soft tissues, cystic and other tumors, ankylosis of the jaw,
amaurosis, otalgia, otorrhoea, deafness, facial paralysis, hemicrania,
oesophagismus, tonsillitis, erysipelas, aphonia, hysteria, neuralgia,
chorea, epilepsy, tetanus, death.[Footnote 77: "Pathological Dentition," extract from annual supplement
to the _Obstet.of Great Britain and Ireland_, April, 1878.]DIAGNOSIS.--The age of the child and the appearances already described
will afford a basis for diagnosis so far as the local manifestations in
the mouth are concerned.The diagnosis of local disorders at a
distance, or of systemic disturbances of whatever character, can be
made out only by careful consideration of all the attending
circumstances; and it is always to be borne in mind that while the
process of dentition is to be recognized as one of the causative
factors, grave injustice might be done the little patient, and its life
perhaps endangered, by failure to recognize the presence of other and
perhaps more potent morbid influences.In cases of chorea or epilepsy, of eye or ear troubles, or of any
morbid condition not otherwise accounted for, occurring during the
period of the second dentition, especially at the sixth, twelfth, and
seventeenth years, or until the wisdom teeth are fully erupted, it is
well to inspect the mouth and to think of dentition as the possible
cause.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis will depend upon the character and gravity of
the associated symptoms, the presence or absence of diathesis, and the
etiological importance attached to dentition.It is impossible to lay
down a general law.TREATMENT.--The treatment of the deuteropathic or associated disorders
is to be conducted on the general principles applicable to those
diseases; for a consideration of which the reader is referred to the
appropriate articles of this work.We have here to consider general
prophylaxis and local measures.The proper management of the child
during the period of the first dentition is a matter of great
importance, and may avert serious complications.The child should be as
much as possible in the open air whenever the weather is favorable.The
head may be daily sponged with cold water, and caps and warm
head-coverings of all kinds should {377} be forbidden.[78] Frequent
rubbing of the gums with a crust or other hard substance, or with the
finger, is advisable; and something for the child to bite on,
preferably a silver piece, should be provided.Orris-root, calamus, and
other vegetable substances frequently given to children for this
purpose are objectionable; their fermentation is apt to lead to thrush.The diet should be carefully
regulated, and cooling drinks be freely given in order that the child
may not overload its stomach by too frequent suckling in its efforts to
relieve the local heat by moisture.The mother should be warned not to
put it too frequently to the breast.Weaned children will often be
found unable to digest their ordinary food, and in that case still
greater care will be required.Slight diarrhoea does not call for
interference, and is often beneficial in relieving nervous tension and
thus averting a tendency to convulsions.Indeed, when the bowels are
not relaxed gentle aperients should be given, especially in plethoric
subjects or in those with cutaneous eruptions (Clarke).Cutaneous
eruptions do not call for treatment, and there seems to be ground for
the popular fear that they may be driven inward; at least, cases are on
record in which their disappearance under treatment, and even
spontaneously, has been followed by more or less severe convulsions.In cases where bronchitis can be traced wholly or in part to soaking of
the clothing, due protection of the chest by an oil-cloth or waterproof
bib may be prophylactic against future attacks.In children who have
suffered from any special set of morbid manifestations during the
eruption of one pair of teeth, similar disturbances may be expected,
and should be guarded against, in the future.Aphthous ulcerations are usually associated with disorders of
digestion, the relief of which must be the main object of treatment.Locally, the treatment does not differ from that of aphthous stomatitis
in general.Obstinate ulceration of the tongue may require the use of
silver nitrate.In that form of ulceration called odontitis infantum,
in addition to proper attention to the diet and secretions and mild
antiphlogistic medication, local depletion by leeches, preferably at
the angle of the jaw, is often beneficial.Some writers advise the
application of leeches directly to the gum.Potassium chlorate
internally, two grains every four hours to a child twelve months old,
is curative in the majority of cases.It may be given dissolved in
sweetened water.Solutions of borax, and, in severe cases, of silver
nitrate, may be applied locally.The use of the lancet is
contraindicated, for the cut surfaces would be liable to ulceration.Incision for a cuspid (White).]Incision for a molar (White).]The propriety of resort to the lancet for cure of systemic disturbances
by obviating the source of local irritation is one which deserves
consideration.It can only be decided upon the indications presented by
the individual case.The knife is not a panacea for all the disorders
of childhood occurring during dentition, and its indiscriminate use is
to be discountenanced.Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that
engorged and inflamed gums demand incision for their relief, on the
same general principles of surgery applicable to similar conditions
elsewhere.Where it is probable that systemic disease, even if not
solely caused, is aggravated by the irritation and pain of a tooth
unable to make its way to the surface unaided, it is clearly the duty
of the physician to give his little patient that modicum of relief, if
not of cure, which will be afforded by a proper incision of {378} the
gum.It will not do merely to score the gums, but cuts should be made
deep enough to reach the presenting surface and extend even beyond its
boundaries.The developing enamel cannot be injured unless undue force
be exerted.The best instrument to employ is a curved double-edged
bistoury, so wrapped as to prevent injury to tongue, cheek, or lips.The child should be firmly held by another person, and in such a
position that the parts may be well illuminated.The jaws can be
separated by the operator's left hand, and the fingers so disposed as
to protect the tongue and lips.Sometimes the insertion of a small cork
between the jaws will be of advantage.The cuts should be made with
special reference to the form of the presenting tooth.James W.
White[79] recommends for the incisors and cuspids a division of the gum
in the line of the arch; for the molars a crucial incision, thus X, the
centre of the crown as near as can be determined indicating the point
of decussation.A cuspid partially erupted needs severance of the
fibrous ring on the anterior and posterior as well as on the lateral
surfaces (Fig.All the cups of a molar may have erupted, and yet
strong fibrous bands maintain a decided resistance.In this case White
thinks that all the boundaries of the tooth should be traced by the
lancet and all such bands completely severed, or else a crucial
incision, as in the figure (Fig.18), should be made so as to ensure
perfect release from pressure.The only contraindication to the use of
the lancet, except in ulcerative odontitis, as before mentioned, is the
existence of a hemorrhagic diathesis.cit._]

DISEASES OF THE TONSILS.BY J. SOLIS COHEN, M.D.DEFINITION.--An acute inflammation of the tonsil or tonsils; or
inflammation of the tonsil or tonsils, with inflammation of the
peritonsillar connective tissue and of the palatine folds.VARIETIES.--When the inflammatory process is confined to the mucous
membrane the disease is erythematous, superficial, or catarrhal
tonsillitis; when it involves the lacunae it constitutes lacunal or
follicular tonsillitis; when it involves the gland as a whole it
constitutes parenchymatous, phlegmonous, or suppurative tonsillitis.When the
superficial inflammatory process is a vesicular one, eventually
sheathing the surface of the organ in whole or in part with a
membranous envelope, it constitutes herpetic or membranous tonsillitis.When the
inflammation of the tonsil, usually superficial, is due to the presence
of a cryptogamic growth, it is a mycotic or parasitic tonsillitis,
benign or malignant (diphtheria), as may be.When the inflammation of
the tonsil is due to rheumatism, it is rheumatic or constitutional
tonsillitis.SYNONYMS.--Inflammation of the tonsils, Amygdalitis, Quinsy, Angina
tonsillaris, Angina phlegmonosa, Phlegmonous sore throat, Cynanche
tonsillaris.Lacunal tonsillitis is more generally known as folliculous
tonsillitis (tonsillitis follicularis).Common membranous or
pseudo-membranous sore throat (angina membranosa communis) is used as a
synonym for herpetic or membranous tonsillitis (tonsillitis herpetica
seu membranosa).Mycosis tonsillaris is a synonym for mycotic
tonsillitis (tonsillitis mycotica benigna or tonsillitis parasitica).The tonsillitis of diphtheria is sometimes termed tonsillitis
diphtheritica, tonsillitis mycotica maligna; that of rheumatism,
tonsillitis rheumatica, angina rheumatica, rheumatic sore throat.HISTORY.--Tonsillitis was described by Hippocrates.Of recent authors,
Sauvages, Cullen, Louis for researches on the effects of blood-letting;
Bell on the specific value of guaiacum; Velpeau as to the use of
powdered alum and nitrate of silver; Bourgeoise on the use of tartar
emetic; Maingault on paralytic sequelae; Hering on mycosis; and the
authors of the various encyclopaedias and dictionaries,--may be
mentioned as chief among the numerous observers whose contributions
have been of most value.The bibliographical references appended to the
{380} compilations last cited will guide the student in gaining access
to the more important special observations of anomalous cases.ETIOLOGY.--Predisposing and Exciting Causes.--Tonsillitis may be
idiopathic, deuteropathic or symptomatic, or traumatic.The predisposing cause of idiopathic tonsillitis is usually diathetic,
and is associated with congenital or inherited vulnerability of the
organ.Of diathetic causes, scrofula is undoubtedly the most
provocative, but even rheumatism and gout are likewise so considered,
though in a far more limited degree.Acute articular rheumatism is, in
fact, sometimes preceded by rather a sharp attack of tonsillitis
(rheumatic tonsillitis), which subsides spontaneously in a very few
days, sometimes within one day, sometimes suddenly and synchronously
with the onset of the ordinary manifestations of rheumatism, though the
latter are often slight and transient, as if the force of the attack
had been spent on the tonsils.Tonsillitis, non-specific in character,
is apt to be prevalent during epidemics of scarlatina, diphtheria,
rubeola, and variola.Membranous tonsillitis is common before and after
epidemics of diphtheria.Epidemics of tonsillitis have been recorded,
but in the face of their extreme rarity it becomes questionable whether
they were not extensive examples of the proclivity just alluded to.Tonsillitis is more frequent in individuals with chronically diseased
tonsils than in individuals in whom these glands are healthy.Such
individuals, too, are more liable to recurrences; and such recurrences
often follow very slight provocations.Idiopathic tonsillitis is rare in infancy.At the period of eruption of
the permanent teeth it is much more liable to occur than before that
period, and the liability increases progressively until the second
dentition has been completed.It is most frequent during the decennium
immediately following puberty--that is to say, in adolescents and young
adults--or from the fifteenth to the twenty-fifth year.The disposition
or predisposition to renewed attacks continues marked during the
decennium immediately succeeding; after which attacks are more and more
infrequent.Certain anatomical changes occurring in the tonsils, as the
rule about the fortieth year, may diminish their proclivity to
inflammation.Nevertheless, the disease occasionally occurs in advanced
age.[1]

[Footnote 1: Solomon Solis Cohen, "Abscess of the Tonsil in an
Octogenarian," _Med.Deuteropathic tonsillitis is quite frequent in infancy, being excited
by the infection of scarlet fever, diphtheria, measles, and small-pox,
as discussed under these headings respectively.Under similar
circumstances it occurs in the adolescent and the adult likewise.It is
also produced in carcinoma and sarcoma of the tonsil.Rheumatic tonsillitis, a deuteropathic variety, is most prevalent
during atmospheric changes.Herpetic tonsillitis, often a deuteropathic variety, seems sometimes of
nervous origin exclusively.It is sometimes traceable to defective
drainage.It is sometimes prevalent during epidemics of diphtheria,
when its membranous character renders it extremely liable to be
mistaken for the tonsillitis of diphtheria.The causes are--inspiration
of irritant gases, the deglutition of chemically acrid substances, the
{381} accumulation of calcareous concretions in the crypts or in the
lacunae, direct and indirect gunshot and other wounds, the impaction of
fish-bones, fragments of toothpicks, cherry-stones, and other foreign
bodies, and the like.Mycotic tonsillitis is due to the development of a cryptogam upon
tonsils probably already in a state of catarrhal inflammation in
individuals with health impaired by previous disease or unfavorable
hygienic influences.SYMPTOMATOLOGY, COURSE, DURATION, TERMINATIONS, COMPLICATIONS, AND
SEQUELAE.--The onset of tonsillitis, sometimes preceded by headache and
general malaise, is often accompanied by a chill, pyrexia following
within twenty-four hours.The temperature may reach 105 degrees F.,
being at its maximum, as a rule, about the third day.It is rarely
below 101 degrees F. The pulse is accelerated to 120 beats per minute.Simultaneously with the constitutional symptoms local distress is
usually manifested, but either set of disturbances may precede the
other by several hours or by an entire day.Heat and soreness of the
throat are early complained of, gradually increasing in severity to
actual pain.The pain may become intense, especially during
deglutition.When the posterior palatine fold is put upon the stretch,
additional pain is referred to the ear, for this fold encloses the
staphylo-salpingeus muscle, which runs from the palate to the
pharyngeal orifice of the Eustachian tube.This pain in the ear,
sometimes the principal cause of complaint, is often premonitory of
suppuration.Noises in the ears on the one hand, and impairment of
hearing on the other, often attend extension of the inflammation in
this direction, the enlarged tonsil sometimes pressing the posterior
palatine fold against the pharyngeal orifice of the Eustachian tube.On inspecting the throat early in the disease, one of the tonsils will
be seen to be swollen into an irregularly tumid, much-inflamed mass,
usually of a vivid red color.Occasionally both tonsils are involved
simultaneously, but this is far less frequent than involvement of the
second tonsil a few days later or after subsidence of the process in
its fellow.In many instances the inflammation affects one tonsil only.The inflammatory process is seldom confined to the tonsil.All the
structures of the throat, even to the base of the tongue, are often
involved, and it is rarely indeed that the anterior palatine fold,
distended over the surface of the tumefied gland, escapes inflammation.It is this stretching of the anterior palatine fold which occasions
much of the exquisite pain that forms so prominent a subjective symptom
in severe cases.The soft palate, hanging forward in the cavity of the
pharynx, is often inflamed or intensely congested, and the uvula
tumefied, elongated, and oedematous.It may be flaccid upon the
posterior part of the tongue or hang immediately over the epiglottis or
upon it, and induce painful and tiresome efforts at deglutition and
expectoration to relieve the consequent titillation.Sometimes it
adheres by viscid secretion to the side of the swollen tonsil.The inflamed tonsil or the tonsil and its coverings project far into
the cavity of the pharynx, often as far as the middle line, touching
its fellow when both are involved, so that ulceration sometimes ensues
at the points of contact.The posterior surface of the anterior
palatine fold sometimes becomes unfolded, as it were, in the
tumefaction of the gland, and remains {382} stretched over it in a thin
continuous layer without any line of demarcation.The swollen palate
projects upon the enlarged tonsil like a shelf, from which depends the
uvula, the latter being often oedematous, usually anteriorly, but
sometimes posteriorly.Inflammation of the connective tissue about the lower jaw, especially
when at or near the articulation, often renders it difficult or even
impracticable to open the mouth sufficiently to permit direct
inspection of the parts; but it is rarely that sufficient space cannot
be made to allow partial protrusion of the tongue on the one hand, and
the introduction of a fore finger for exploratory purposes on the
other, though both of these acts are sometimes impossible.The
tumefaction of the parts impairs the freedom and ease of deglutition,
which may become so painful as to prevent the swallowing of the saliva,
which then may dribble from the mouth.The pain experienced in swallowing is often manifested by convulsive
action of the muscles of deglutition and of the muscles of the face.The swollen tonsils prevent the soft palate from being applied to the
surface of the pharynx, as usual in deglutition; and as the upper or
retro-nasal portion of the pharynx thus fails to be shut off from the
lower oesophageal portion, liquids are often forced up into the nasal
passages posteriorly, and are regurgitated through the nostrils, thus
rendering it impracticable, for the time, to slake thirst or to swallow
liquid nourishment.At first sensations of dryness and pastiness in the throat are
complained of, but in a few hours these symptoms become relieved by a
more copious secretion of mucus or mucus and saliva.This secretion
soon becomes viscid, and so adherent to the parts as to be detached
only with difficulty, thus causing harassing efforts for its
dislodgment by hawking and expectoration, or equally distressing
efforts to swallow it.Should the inflammatory process extend to the
salivary glands, as is not infrequently the case, secondary ptyalism
often results, with increased distress from this source, and the
patient lies or sits with his head inclined upon the diseased or most
diseased side to favor the uninterrupted flow of saliva from the mouth.Extension of the inflammatory process to the submaxillary glands, or to
the parotid, or to the connective tissue surrounding them, is indicated
by tumefaction externally, which is often exquisitively sensitive to
pressure.The timbre or quality of the voice is often impaired in a peculiar
manner by the tumefaction of the throat and the immobility of the soft
palate.The voice is thick, throaty, or guttural, having a
characteristic harsh, rasping aspiration in enunciation, while
articulation is much impeded by impairment in the movements of the jaw,
palate, tongue, and lips.Speech is
sometimes indistinguishable or impossible, and the voice may even
become suppressed, so that signs and writing remain the sole means of
communication.Impairment of respiration, at least to any considerable degree, does
not occur, unless both tonsils are involved and swollen to an intense
degree--conditions under which dyspnoea may become pronounced, severe,
and even urgent, and suffocation become imminent.Painful respiration
is not uncommon in rheumatic tonsillitis.There are often severe aching pains in
{383} the limbs.Headache, restlessness, insomnia, nausea, and even
vomiting, may occur.The tongue is heavily coated, the breath is fetid,
appetite is impaired, and the bowels are constipated.The urine is
diminished in quantity, high-, and of high specific gravity.It
usually shows slight increase of urea and great diminution of
chlorides.The symptoms are proportionate to the severity of the attack.A first
attack is usually much severer than subsequent ones, and suppurative
cases more severe than those terminating by resolution.Resolution is
the usual termination, and the parts are restored to a normal condition
at the end of ten to fourteen days, sometimes earlier; in exceptional
cases not until three or four weeks.Sometimes permanent hypertrophy of
the tonsil remains.Where the inflammatory process fails to subside, suddenly at the end of
five or six days, or a little later, or not until ten days to a
fortnight have passed, slight rigors supervene, announcing suppuration,
and the local distress is very great, with pulsation and lancinating
pains in the tonsils, until all at once the abscess bursts and its
contents are discharged with immediate relief.Sometimes the pus or
much of it is involuntarily swallowed; sometimes it is expectorated.In
exceptional instances the pus has escaped into the larynx and
suffocated the patient, usually during sleep.[2] In rare instances the
abscess, having burrowed beneath the pharyngeal muscles, may open at
the external angle of the jaw or behind the sterno-mastoid muscle.It
may discharge into the epiglotto-pharyngeal fold, and thence reach and
distend the epiglottis.It has been known to descend along the planes
of connective tissue into the mediastinum or into the lungs.Even
ulceration into the maxillary and carotid arteries has occurred,
usually with fatal result, occasionally with an opportunity to save
life by ligating the carotid (Erhmann).[3]

[Footnote 2: Stokes, _Med.med._, Paris, 1878, p.The most frequent point of spontaneous rupture externally is at the
upper portion of the gland anteriorly, just beneath the anterior
palatine fold.Sometimes internal rupture occurs into the lacunae.Termination by gangrene is exceptional, and is confined to individuals
with debilitated constitutions.It is much less frequent than
formerly--as a result, perhaps, of better methods of treatment.Metastasis is one of the methods of termination as to joints or muscles
in rheumatic tonsillitis--to lungs, brain, or gastro-intestinal
tract--as formerly occurred with much more frequency under direct
depletory treatment.In rare cases extension of the inflammation occurs to the epiglottis,
even to the larynx, and the laryngitis may be so severe as to threaten
life from the occurrence of oedema.Diffuse inflammation of the
retro-pharyngeal connective tissue or of the connective tissue of the
neck may constitute an unpleasant complication of the disease.In a few instances paralysis of the palate occurs as a sequel of
tonsillitis, and in exceptional cases the paralysis may also affect the
arytenoid muscles of the larynx, and even the accommodator muscles of
the eyes.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Tonsillitis is almost always {384}
associated with inflammation of the tissues surrounding the tonsil and
those contiguous to it, even in the mildest and most frequent
manifestations of the affection.Thus, inflammation of the palate
(staphyllitis) and uvula, and even of the pharynx (pharyngitis), are
anatomically included with tonsillitis in angina or sore throat.The mildest form of the malady is a catarrhal inflammation of the
mucous membrane covering the gland, and does not extend along the
lacunae which dip inward from the surface and divaricate toward the
interior of the organ.It is termed catarrhal tonsillitis, and, as has
been intimated, is almost always associated with catarrhal sore throat.It is attributed to hyperaemia, with passive engorgement of the
vessels, following retrocession of blood from the cutaneous surface
after undue exposure to cold and moisture.A severer form of the malady
involves the lacunae in addition--several or all of them.This should
be termed lacunar tonsillitis, as suggested by Wagner.Primarily, at
least, it does not involve the follicles of the tonsils which open into
the lacunae, and is therefore incorrectly denominated follicular
tonsillitis, although it is most generally so described.The lacunae
are involutions of the mucous membrane, and in health furnish a
slightly turbid mucoid secretion which serves to lubricate the parts
and, as is generally believed, to facilitate deglutition.When the
lacunae are inflamed these products become pent up in them to a certain
extent, accumulate, and project in part at their orifices in turbid
creamy or curdy masses, plastered over the parts when thin in
consistence, or tightly imbedded when thick or desiccated.These masses
are usually white, but sometimes, owing to various admixtures, they are
more or less yellowish or gray or brown.They consist of epithelium
chiefly, with more or less pus and accumulation of cells similar to
those of which the follicles are composed--whether from follicles which
have become distended by proliferation of their constituents, and have
then burst, is not known.This epithelium has often undergone fatty
degeneration in part.Cholesterin is an occasional constituent, and
swarms of micrococci and bacteria abound when the masses are not
recent, especially if the inflammation is occurring in a tonsil long
the seat of chronic disease of the lacunae.The tonsil itself is moderately swollen and its mucous membrane
hyperaemic.If the parenchyma of the tonsil be involved likewise, as
often occurs, the swelling will be much greater, so that the gland will
project a considerable distance beyond the margins of the palatine
folds.When a hypertrophied tonsil is the seat of the inflammation the
tumefaction will be much greater than when the inflamed tonsil has been
normal.Acute inflammation of the palatine folds often coexists, especially of
the anterior fold.The soft palate may also be engaged in the morbid
process, which may involve the uvula likewise.Pharyngitis is an
occasional accompaniment, and stomatitis quite a rare one.Lacunar tonsillitis sometimes subsides by spontaneous evacuation of the
pent-up contents of secretion and desquamation, the parts returning to
their normal condition.More frequently a desiccation of some of these
products ensues, with permanent chronic inflammation.Decomposition
then often takes place, fouling the breath by the escape of the gases.Butyric acid has been recognized as one of the most prominent of these
fetid {385} gases.Calcareous change occurs in these contents of the
lacunae in some instances.Lacunar or follicular tonsillitis is often
associated with severe inflammation of the peritonsillar connective
tissue and the contiguous palatine fold, with serous or cellular
infiltration into these structures almost always terminating in
suppuration.This form of tonsillitis is very frequent, and is often
confounded with parenchymatous tonsillitis or with tonsillar abscess.In these cases the abscess is in the peritonsillar tissue or in the
posterior leaflet of the anterior palatine fold.It bursts above the
tonsil at the angle between the two folds in the greater number of
cases.In some instances the suppurative inflammation affects the
anterior surface of the posterior palatine fold, sometimes contiguously
to the antero-tonsillar abscess, sometimes independently, constituting
a retro-tonsillar abscess.The follicles in the posterior palatine fold
are sometimes involved, the thickened anterior surface of this
structure becoming studded with small projections the size of ordinary
pinheads or larger, distended with whitish-yellow contents.In another class of cases of tonsillitis the inflammatory process may
be chiefly parenchymatous, for rarely is it wholly so.That is to say,
it may involve the glandular structure of the organ wholly or in main
part.The disease is then an adenitis, an inflammation of
gland-tissue--tonsillitis per se.It is associated with superficial
inflammation of the surrounding mucous membrane, secondarily if not
primarily, and often with inflammation of the lacunae.In many
instances the parenchymatous inflammation is a direct extension of the
lacunar inflammation.Parenchymatous tonsillitis may subside by resolution, or, as is quite
frequent, terminate by suppuration.A number of small abscesses may be
formed, which usually become confluent and rarely remain discrete.The confluent abscess may
discharge by several points.It is always associated with a severe
inflammation of the palatine folds and palate, especially the anterior
fold; sometimes of the adjoining half of the soft palate and the uvula;
sometimes of the entire velum and uvula.Sometimes these parts become
oedematous; sometimes suppuration ensues.Severe pharyngitis is not
uncommon.Glossitis, involving the posterior portion of the tongue
especially or exclusively, is an occasional accompaniment of
parenchymatous tonsillitis.Occasionally oedema takes
place in the epiglottis and upper margin of the larynx.Sometimes these are semifluid;
sometimes soft, caseous, or pultaceous; sometimes fibrinous and
arranged in pseudo-membranes; sometimes hemorrhagic; sometimes moist
and viscid, sometimes very dry; often adherent, and always containing
cryptogams (leptothrix, Oidium albicans, bacteria, and micrococci).Collections of caseous products accumulate not only in the crypts of
the tonsils and in their overlying mucous membrane, but likewise in the
follicles of the palatine folds below the tonsil, and thence toward the
base of the tongue.The submaxillary glands often undergo engorgement, and become so tender
that external manipulation is painful, and sometimes they undergo
suppuration.The tumefaction due to the swollen glands and infiltrated
connective tissue around it is frequently incorrectly referred to the
tonsil itself, rather than to the accompanying inflamed palate, with
the {386} lymphatics of which these glands are in more direct
anatomical connection.The tonsil is at a considerable distance from
the inflamed glands, and cannot be felt from the exterior except under
unusual circumstances.Herpetic tonsillitis is a rare form of inflammation of the tonsil, or
rather of its investing mucous membrane, characterized by the eruption
of herpetic vesicles on its surface.The vesicles soon undergo rupture,
and the resulting ulcers coalesce and become covered with a fibrinous
exudation.The disease is usually associated with similar vesicles upon
the palatine folds and upon the soft palate, and exceptionally with
vesicles on the pharynx.(See Herpetic Pharyngitis.)It is by some
fortuitous circumstance only that it is observed in the vesicular
stage.It is confined to one side of the throat in most instances, but
may be bilateral also.Mycosis tonsillaris has been described by a few observers.B.
Fraenkel[4] has recorded three cases, E. Fraenkel[5] one, and Bayer[6]
two.In these cases the disease was not confined to the tonsils, but
implicated the calciform papillae of the tongue also, and one of
Bayer's cases some pharyngeal follicles in addition.E. Fraenkel's case
was in a male, and occupied but the right tonsil and base of tongue.The white masses in this case were formed of spores and filaments
(Bacillus fasciculatus, Sadebeck), which are described as penetrating
some millimeters into the gland-tissue.These masses were tenacious,
and were reproduced rapidly after removal.In Bayer's cases, both
females, the same microphyte was recognized.In a female patient
observed at the Philadelphia Polyclinic[7] this affection followed
rheumatic tonsillitis, diphtheria being prevalent near her residence,
which was in a very unsalubrious locality.The deposit, confined to the
left tonsil, was so firmly adherent to the mucous membrane that the
implicated portion had to be torn away to get rid of the growth, which
was twice reproduced.The fungus was in its mycelial state, a few
spores and conidiferous filaments being recognized microscopically.94; _ibid._, 1880, No.[Footnote 5: _Zeitschrift fur klin.de Laryngologie, etc._, Nov., 1882, p.[Footnote 7: S. Solis-Cohen, _The Polyclinic_, March, 1884, p.Quite recently, and since the above was written, the results of an
elaborate study of this affection by Theodor Hering of Warsaw have been
published in a paper entitled "Pharynxmycosis leptothricia,"[8] read
before the Society of German Naturalists and Physicians.The author
collates fourteen cases, six of which were observed by himself.He
claims that the microphyte is simply the Leptothrix buccalis.[Footnote 8: _Zeitschrift fur klinische Medicin_, Bd.The local subjective symptoms as collated by Hering vary from the
merest sense of discomfort in chronic cases to intense pain, difficulty
in speech and in deglutition, and various grades of cough in acute
ones.Constitutional
disturbance may be entirely absent or may be presented in various
febrile or sub-febrile manifestations.DIAGNOSIS.--The history of the attack, the appearances described, and
the symptoms narrated should ordinarily suffice for a correct
diagnosis.An unsuspected tumor of the tonsil
observed for the first time during an ordinary sore throat might be
taken for an inflamed tonsil, but the progress of the case would soon
lead to its due {387} recognition.While tonsillitis is infrequent
after the fourth decennium, it occasionally occurs late in life, and
has been observed even in the ninth decennium; and reserve is proper as
to the cause of enlarged tonsils in the sore throats of those advanced
in life.The deposit in follicular or lacunar tonsillitis or angina is pulpy and
not membraniform.It can be wiped from the surface with a fragment of
sponge, and does not tear from the surface in strips, as is the case
with the pseudo-membrane of diphtheria or of common membranous sore
throat.There is no abrasion of the mucous membrane beneath the
deposit.The patches are more prominent, usually more circumscribed,
and dip down into the lacunae, or rather project from the crypts upon
the surface of the tonsil.In its physical aspect the deposit more
closely resembles that observed in the sore throats accompanying
cachectic conditions, as in chronic tuberculosis, advanced syphilis,
some forms of scarlatina, typhus and typhoid fever, extreme old age
(agine pultacee, Fr.; cachectic angina); but the existence of previous
constitutional disease and actual debility should prevent the mistake
in diagnosis.In susceptible subjects the oncoming of an attack of
rheumatic tonsillitis may often be inferred, previous to the
manifestation of local symptoms, from the existence of otherwise
inexplicable odynphagia, the pain being especially intense upon
attempts to swallow saliva.Sometimes laryngoscopic inspection at this
early stage of the disease will reveal vivid redness of the mucous
membrane in the neighborhood of the crico-arytenoid articulations.[9]
The value of this early diagnosis lies in the opportunity it affords to
try abortive treatment.[Footnote 9: S. Solis Cohen, _The Medical News_, Aug.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of catarrhal tonsillitis is almost invariably
favorable, except under very obviously unfavorable conditions, the
inflammatory process subsiding spontaneously within a few days.It is
favorable, as a rule, in phlegmonous tonsillitis subsiding within ten
or twelve days in most instances, even though all the stages be
completed to suppuration and discharge of the abscess.Sometimes two or
three weeks are consumed in the process.A certain amount of reserve is
requisite, nevertheless, in severe cases, in view of the possible
complications which may prevent recovery.If both tonsils are affected
to such an extent as to interfere seriously with respiration, death by
suffocation may ensue should the obstruction be not relieved by
excision of portions of the swollen glands or an artificial opening be
not made into the air-passage.Suppuration may perforate the internal
carotid or the external maxillary artery and produce sudden fatal
hemorrhage.The remembrance of such occurrences should screen a surgeon
from the imputation of carelessness should he be unfortunate enough to
incise an abscess under similar conditions.Some cases are on record of
fatal hemorrhage but a short period before a proposed operation could
have been performed.Suffocation has ensued from discharge of the abscess into the
air-passage, usually during sleep; but it has occurred even during the
moment of speaking (Stokes).[10] Such results are accidental and
exceptional.Recurrences are frequent, especially in scrofulous subjects, and such
recurrences are apt to result in permanent hypertrophy and induration.TREATMENT.--Mild cases of tonsillitis require no treatment except to
{388} keep the patient protected from exposure to abrupt changes of
temperature.The course of the affection both in mild cases and in
severe ones may often be materially shortened by prompt resort to the
use of guaiacum, both internally and topically.A gargle containing an
ounce each of ammoniated tincture of guaiacum and compound tincture of
cinchona to the pint, with the addition of three ounces of clarified
honey, and saturated with potassium chlorate (twenty grains to the
ounce), may be used, a drachm at a time, every two hours, hour, or half
hour, according to the urgency of the symptoms, and may likewise be
administered internally in drachm doses for an adult every two or more
hours.The beneficial effects will often be manifested within less than
twelve hours.Pellets of ice held in the mouth from time to time often
relieve pain and repress inflammation.Sodium bicarbonate locally, in
powder, affords great relief in some instances.In the presence of
marked pyrexia tincture of aconite may be given in drop doses every
hour until an impression has been made upon the heart, when its
continuance at intervals of four or more hours will be a matter for
consideration.Guaiacum and aconite may be given with equal benefit in any form
preferred by the prescriber.At the same time saline laxatives may be
required from time to time.When the tonsils are very much swollen, gargling of all kinds becomes
too painful, and therefore sprays of sedative and emollient mixtures
are to be substituted, or steam from water impregnated with volatile
substances, as benzoin, paregoric, hops, chamomile, and sage.When the
cervical glands are swollen, continuous hot and moist applications
externally afford great relief.If the suffering from the inflamed
tonsil be intense, scarification should be practised and the bleeding
be encouraged by warm water.When suppuration exists, the abscess
should be promptly evacuated by incision at the most prominent
accessible point.The pain in swallowing can often be diminished by pulling on the lobe
of the ear at the moment of deglutition (Grewcock).[11] In debilitated
subjects, or during epidemics of diphtheria, quinia, iron, and
supporting measures are indicated.[Footnote 11: _Lancet_, Nov., 1882, N.Y.The rheumatic cases are best treated with sodium salicylate, ten to
fifteen grains every hour or two until relieved.Instituted in the
formative stage above alluded to, this treatment frequently seems to be
veritably abortive, especially when preceded by a full dose of an
alkaline purgative--say one ounce of Rochelle salts.Oil of gaultheria
may be used in small doses as an agreeable flavor to the mixture, or in
doses of ten to twenty minims, well diluted, as an adjuvant to the
salicylate, or even as a substitute for it.After subsidence of the
acute symptoms cinchonidine salicylate may be continued for a few days
in appropriate doses.Herpetic tonsillitis requires the ordinary treatment for erythematous
tonsillitis, with additional topical treatment by sprays of alkaline
solutions, such as sodium borate or bicarbonate, five grains to the
ounce, or lime-water.Internally, small doses of mercuric chloride will
be of service, the dose varying, according to the age and size of the
patient, from one-forty-eighth to one-sixteenth of a grain every two
hours, until the stomach shows signs of irritation therefrom.In cases
of doubt as to {389} diagnosis from diphtheria the treatment for
diphtheria will be indicated as the safer measure.Here, again, the
mercuric chloride is sometimes equally valuable.Mycosis of the tonsil does not seem amenable to medicinal treatment.Thorough removal of the fungus with forceps or sharp spoons is
required, even though mucous membrane be detached with it.When this is
impracticable, ablation of the tonsil may be necessary.Raw or cut
surfaces left by any of these manipulations should be subjected to
thorough cauterization, electric cauterization being the most feasible
method.{390}

DISEASES OF THE PHARYNX.BY J. SOLIS COHEN, M.D.DEFINITION.--An acute inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
pharynx, whether implicating the glandular structures or not, and
usually associated with inflammation of contiguous structures.[1] Acute
pharyngitis may be catarrhal or erythematous, phlegmonous or
suppurative, ulcerative, herpetic or membranous, gangrenous, and
erysipelatous.[Footnote 1: In deference to the plan suggested by the editor of this
work, separate articles have been prepared under the heads of
Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis respectively.The two processes, however,
are so frequently associated that they should be studied together, the
more that both of them are likewise associated with extensions of the
inflammatory process to the palate, palatine folds, base of the tongue,
and other contiguous structures.The writer has always preferred to
describe these diseases under the head of sore throat, which does not
presuppose any limitation to individual anatomical structures.]SYNONYMS.--Sore throat; Angina.ETIOLOGY.--Acute pharyngitis may be idiopathic, deuteropathic,
traumatic, toxic, or parasitic.The predisposing cause may be
diathetic, as scrofula, rheumatism, gout, and syphilis; it may be a
depression of the vital powers from any cause, such as continued
exposure to foul air or impure water, improper diet or sedentary
occupations.There exists in some individuals a predisposition to
"catching cold," independent of any cachexia.Pharyngitis may occur at
any age, but is more frequent in the young.One attack increases
subsequent liability to the disease.The exciting cause is usually exposure to cold and damp.Hence the
disease is more frequent at the seasons when these conditions prevail
or when sudden changes of temperature are taking place.Sudden chilling
of the body when overheated may occasion it in warm weather; for
instance, a plunge into the ocean while covered with perspiration.The
ulcerative variety, when not due to syphilis or tuberculosis, is
usually of septic origin, and is apt to occur in the debilitated
especially.The gangrenous form, which is rare, results from profound
blood-poisoning.The herpetic or membranous variety may be due to
disturbance of the trophic nervous system, and has been attributed to
mental emotion (Feron), to uterine disturbances (Bertholle), to the
contact of irritating substances and to miasmatic or fetid exhalations
(Peter).It prevails principally during epidemics of diphtheria or of
scarlet fever, and may be of cryptogamic origin.The cryptogam of
thrush is sometimes developed on the mucous membrane of the pharynx,
either primitively or as an extension of the disease from the oral
cavity.Certain conditions of the {391} atmosphere give rise at times
to so-called epidemic pharyngitis.Paludal or malarial pharyngitis may
arise from the same causes as malarial fevers.Pharyngitis occurs in
the various exanthemata as an essential part of the morbid process, and
is always more or less prevalent during epidemics of measles or scarlet
fever.It occurs not rarely in typhoid fever, and is an occasional
complication of pneumonia, rheumatism, herpes, pemphigus, and other
acute affections.It is one of the complications of facial erysipelas,
but erysipelatous pharyngitis may occur primarily.Pharyngitis may be
excited by the inhalation of deleterious solid, fluid, and gaseous
substances in the atmosphere which act mechanically or chemically on
the mucous membrane.Many drugs administered in poisonous or even in
medicinal doses may give rise to an attack of inflammation of the
pharynx; among them may be cited preparations of mercury, antimony,
iodine, arsenic, copper, lead, zinc, silver, stramonium, belladonna,
and most of the Solanaceae.Traumatic pharyngitis results from
deglutition of boiling water or of acrid or caustic substances; from
inhalation of hot air, of steam, or of flame, and is most usually
associated with traumatic oesophagitis or with laryngitis.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Acute pharyngitis, as most commonly
encountered, is a simple erythematous inflammation of the mucous
membrane; the palate and tonsils being likewise involved.In most
instances there is simply an active hyperaemia which may subside in a
day or two.When more intense than this the mucous membrane of the
palate, tonsils, and pharynx becomes congested and swollen, uniformly
or in circumscribed areas.In some instances the submucous tissue of
the pharynx is greatly relaxed, and the mucous membrane lies upon the
substructure in thick folds.In others there is more or less oedema.The mucous follicles, especially those of the posterior palatine folds,
are frequently swollen.There is an abnormal though not excessive
secretion of viscid mucus, clear or turbid.The uvula is often swollen
or distended with serum, and its mucous membrane is relaxed.Sometimes
it appears as though pasted to one of the folds of the palate by viscid
secretion.The posterior palatine folds may be distended with serum,
and their arched appearance thus become obliterated.Resolution occurs
gradually in some instances, quickly in others.Phlegmonous pharyngitis exhibits a still higher grade of inflammation.It involves the submucous structures as well as the mucous membrane,
including at times the fibrous sheaths of the muscles.It may, in
addition, involve the palate, the tonsils, the base of the tongue, and
contiguous structures.Suppuration is common, usually circumscribed,
but not infrequently diffuse in patients of enfeebled constitution.One variety of the disease is essentially a deep-seated pharyngitis;
and this form almost always progresses to suppuration (suppurative
pharyngitis).The process becomes then, not infrequently, a diffuse
suppurative inflammation of the subpharyngeal connective tissue,
extending sometimes downward along the oesophagus, into which the pus
may be discharged by spontaneous rupture, with a result of permanent
stricture from irregular cicatrization.Sometimes the suppurative
process extends anteriorly beneath the cervical fascia, and the pus may
gravitate so as to occlude the air-passages, partly or completely, by
direct pressure; or in other instances the entrance of {392} the larynx
may become blocked by the tumefaction of the pharynx.When phlegmonous
pharyngitis is of traumatic origin, there will be more or less
destruction of the mucous membrane according to the nature of the
injury, whether accidental or designed, whether due to burn, scald,
inhalation of hot air or steam, or to deglutition of alkaline, acid, or
other corrosive substances.In these cases the morbid process is rarely
confined to the pharynx, but the larynx, the oesophagus, and even the
stomach, are liable to be involved.If regurgitation of hot air or of
caustic fluids takes place through the nasal passages, the injury will
of course involve those regions.Ulcerative pharyngitis is a low form of inflammation present in sore
throat, probably dependent upon septicaemia.The tonsils are somewhat
congested and swollen, and one or more white superficial ulcers form on
their surface, or on the palate, or on the pharynx.These ulcers are
generally round or oval, and vary greatly in size.When two or more
ulcers exist, they exhibit no tendency to confluence.Healing takes
place rapidly, usually without leaving any traces of the lesion.Membranous pharyngitis, or herpes of the pharynx, is one of the
infrequent phenomena of a not uncommon sore throat, which exhibits at
first a collection of small vesicles the size of millet-seeds or
larger, isolated here and there or clustered in groups on the palate
and uvula, less frequently on the tonsils.Herpes of the mouth and lips
sometimes coexists.These vesicles are surrounded by inflammatory
areolae.In rare instances they
disappear without trace after a day or two.Usually they soon undergo
rupture, sometimes within a few hours, so that small ulcers are left,
which almost immediately become covered with a grayish-white exudation.A number of patches will coalesce, forming limited sheets of false
membrane not unlike those of diphtheria.The disease is usually
confined to one side of the throat, the corresponding submaxillary or
cervical glands being affected moderately when at all involved.The
tonsil is swollen, and the mucous membrane of the palate and the
palatine folds is congested and often tumefied.There is an abnormal
secretion of viscid, ropy, turbid mucus.In a few days the ulcers heal
beneath the exudation, which becomes disintegrated and detached, the
inflammatory process subsiding by gradual resolution.Sometimes the
ulcers cicatrize without previous deposit of false membrane.Occasionally there are at longer or shorter intervals successive crops
of vesicles, which may or may not undergo ulceration.Gangrenous pharyngitis may supervene upon any form of pharyngitis, but
in the majority of instances its malignant character is inevitable from
the outset; so that some authors have even restricted the term
gangrenous to a form of sore throat characterized by primitive gangrene
of the pharyngeal mucous membrane originating independently of any
other malady.Whether an idiopathic disease, or whether it follows
scarlatina, measles, small-pox, dysentery, or enteric fever, it is
associated with that depraved condition of the system denominated
typhoid.At times it occurs in tuberculous phthisis.The initial
manifestations may be simply those of intense inflammation.The tongue
is covered with a dark creamy, pultaceous deposit consisting of
broken-down epithelium, pus-cells, bacteria, and molecular debris,
while similar masses are occasionally seen upon other mucous surfaces
of the mouth and throat.The tonsils, {393} palate, and pharynx are
livid and swollen, and sometimes oedematous.At an early period the
tonsils, the palatine folds, and the posterior wall of the pharynx
become covered with dark, ashy- ulcers with excavated edges.Sometimes these spots are black from the first, and appear slightly
elevated.These soon slough out with more or less of the surrounding
tissues, and the ulcers left are covered with sanious, ichorous, fetid
secretion.In some instances a delicate pseudo-membrane has been found
in the bed of the ulcer after death (Mackenzie).The destructive
process rapidly extends--sometimes to the oesophagus in one direction
or to the nares in the other.The larynx is less frequently implicated;
should it be attacked, oedema is liable to occur.Occasionally the
process is limited to the tonsil, and there is no pharyngitis at all.Erosion of the blood-vessels may give rise to fatal hemorrhage.In
those instances where the gangrene is circumscribed there are found,
post-mortem, depressed oval or circular patches from one-twentieth to
one-half an inch in diameter, varying in color from dark gray to
absolute black.The edges are of a brownish color and are
perpendicular.The bundles of muscular fibre are laid bare by
destruction of the mucous membrane and submucous connective tissue, but
as a rule escape implication of their substance.Similar patches have
been noted in the epiglottis and the upper part of the larynx as well
as in the mouth and pharynx--in some cases, indeed, in the trachea, the
lungs, the oesophagus, the stomach, and the intestines.Erysipelatous pharyngitis is usually an extension of erysipelas from
the facial integument, which may take place by the lips and mucous
membrane of the mouth, by the nasal fossae, by the Eustachian tube from
the tympanum and external ear, or by the nasal fossae from the
conjunctiva and eyelids through the lachrymal duct.When the disease
begins in the pharynx the order of communication may be reversed.The
pathological processes are the same as in cutaneous erysipelas.The
mucous membrane of the pharynx will be diffusely red or purplish and
shiny.Sometimes little bullae are formed and become ruptured, leaving
a patch of softened whitish-yellow tissue, which is sometimes torn from
the surface beneath by the act of coughing or of deglutition.The
inability to swallow is not due to swelling of the tissues, but to
actual paresis of the muscles, probably from interstitial infiltration,
but perhaps from implication of their substance.The cervical and
submaxillary glands are rarely involved.Erysipelatous pharyngitis
usually terminates by resolution, desquamation of the greater part of
the epithelium of the mucous membrane often taking place; but it may be
followed by abscess or by gangrene.Extension may take place to the
larynx, and oedema may follow.Exanthematous pharyngitis accompanies some cases of cutaneous
exanthemata.The pharyngitis of small-pox is occasioned by an eruption
upon the mucous membrane similar to that which appears on the skin.Often in advance of the cutaneous eruption it occupies the inside of
the cheeks, the palate, uvula, and pharynx; sometimes the larynx as
well.Maturation occurs more rapidly than upon the skin, and there is
more or less purulent infiltration of the submucous connective tissues.Ulceration of the larynx or trachea may ensue so severe in character as
to cause fatal termination by the local lesion.{394} In measles an eruption similar to the cutaneous manifestation
occupies the air-tract from nostril to bronchi rather than the
food-passages.The Eustachian tubes may be involved, and the
inflammation is sometimes propagated along the lachrymal duct.The
throat may be affected a day or two before the external integument.Small red points the size of a millet-seed or larger appear on the
palate, the tonsils, the posterior palatine folds, and the wall of the
pharynx.These disappear in a few days, though sometimes in bad cases
fibrinous exudation may accumulate.In other instances abscess or
ulceration takes place, chiefly in the larynx.The pharyngitis of scarlatina develops a day or two prior to the
cutaneous eruption, the mucous membrane of the palate, tonsils, and
pharynx being deeply congested, uniformly or in patches, with slight
papulous elevations here and there.In the course of a day or two an
opalescent or milky deposit, consisting chiefly of detached epithelium
and viscid mucus, is observed on the swollen palate and tonsils.In the
anginose variety the hue of the inflamed structures is more dusky.There is a pseudo-membranous deposit of a dirty-white, ash, or even
yellow color.It is not limited to the tonsils, but accumulates rather
on the palate, palatine folds, and posterior wall of the pharynx.The
mucous membrane beneath the patches is often ulcerated, and sometimes
gangrenous.There is much greater tumefaction of all the parts than in
simple scarlatina, the enlargement of the cervical and submaxillary
glands and the infiltration of contiguous connective tissue being so
great in some instances as to prevent the mouth from being opened.A
viscid and turbid secretion accumulates in the mouth.The nasal
secretions sometimes desiccate into firm crusts.Sometimes otitis media results from extension along the Eustachian
tube, and sometimes suppuration of the membrana tympani, suppurative
external otitis, or disease of the internal ear with extension to the
cerebrum.In malignant cases all the processes are aggravated.Ulceration or gangrene soon ensues, the pseudo-membranous deposit being
dark, almost black, from extravasated blood.Oedema of the uvula and
soft palate is liable to occur, and if the larynx be involved there may
be oedema of the epiglottis and ary-epiglottic folds.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Simple pharyngitis very often gives rise to but little
discomfort.There is usually more or less heat and dryness in the
parts, especially at first.There is some dysphagia, principally from
pain in swallowing, but in part from actual debility in the muscles of
deglutition.Hoarseness is not usual, and cough is infrequent if there
be no elongation of the uvula.Speech may be embarrassed by difficulty
of articulation.There is usually some febrile movement, with
acceleration of pulse and respiration.Some cases exhibit more intense
inflammatory action, with a corresponding aggravation of the
constitutional symptoms.The skin becomes markedly heated, the
body-temperature rises to 101 degrees F. or higher, the pulse reaching
100-120, in some instances 140, beats per minute, even in the adult.In that variety known as rheumatic sore throat there will be in
addition pain and soreness in the neck, back, and limbs, often severe,
and increased by motion.There will be great accumulation of saliva in
the mouth because of the intense pain in swallowing it.Speech, and
even respiration, may become painful.These manifestations are
frequently {395} followed by the ordinary phenomena of acute articular
rheumatism, but they may subside in a few days, leaving only a general
feeling of muscular soreness or slight stiffness in one or more of the
joints.In some cases of pharyngitis the cervical glands become swollen and
painful, but this is not common.In children the constitutional
disturbance is much greater than in adults.In malarial districts or in
subjects of malarial poisoning the manifestations may assume a periodic
character.Recovery takes place, as a rule, in from three to ten days.In many instances the local phenomena are most prominently manifested
on one side of the throat.There will then exist great liability to
similar involvement of the other side after convalescence of a day or
two, and without care and avoidance of exposure the second attack may
be far more severe than the first.The severe variety of pharyngitis denominated phlegmonous is often
ushered in with a decided chill, the phenomena of fever following
within twenty-four hours.The symptoms, both local and general, are of
much greater severity than in catarrhal pharyngitis, especially in
cases proceeding to suppuration.Paralysis of the palate and other paralyses may follow either of the
forms of sore throat just described.In
extremely rare cases it is an accompaniment of the disease.Superficial ulceration of the mucous membrane may occur in almost any
form of pharyngitis or of sore throat.Some authors have separated a
special form of ulcerative sore throat occurring in those enfeebled
from long exposure to unwholesome influences, such as nurses, hospital
attendants, etc., in whom the first symptom is pain in deglutition,
especially of saliva.The tongue is furred and the breath is offensive.There is loss of appetite, with general lassitude, feebleness of
circulation, and more or less elevation of temperature.The ulcerative sore throats of syphilis and of tuberculosis require
separate consideration.Common membranous pharyngitis frequently gives rise to but slight
symptoms, differing very little from those of other forms of
pharyngitis; but there may be high fever of sthenic or of asthenic
type, very often preceded by general malaise, sometimes by a decided
chill.The pain in deglutition and the local heat and dryness are
sometimes much greater than in the more ordinary forms of pharyngitis.The distress may extend into the ear, sometimes to the nasal passages,
in rare instances to the larynx.The disease lasts for a week or ten
days, usually terminating in recovery.In occasional instances, chiefly
in children, it terminates fatally by apnoea from extension of the
membrane into the larynx.The advent of gangrenous pharyngitis is sometimes indicated by sthenic
phenomena, but usually from the first it is marked by extreme
prostration, comparable in some instances to the collapse of cholera.The
skin, especially of the extremities, is cold and blue.The eye is
glassy, the countenance haggard.The pain, as a rule, is not severe,
sensation being benumbed.The disease is often accompanied by an
irregular erythematous cutaneous {396} eruption.The secretions and
excretions escape by the mouth and nose, and they are extremely fetid.There is indeed a peculiar odor, which once encountered can scarcely be
mistaken.If the lungs become affected there will be copious
haemoptysis.In some cases the tendency to hemorrhage is general, blood
oozing or gushing simultaneously from lungs, bowels, nose, and mouth,
and sometimes extravasating beneath the skin.Sphacelus ultimately
takes place at the points of ecchymosis.Diarrhoea, abundant and fetid,
due to invasion of the alimentary tract, often sets in before the
close, and may be regarded as a sure precursor of death.Death usually
takes place from syncope, intelligence often remaining unaffected to
the last.When these cases recover a horrible amount of deformity often
remains to mark the ravages of the disease.During cicatrization the
positions of contiguous parts become very much altered.The palate may
become adherent by its sides, and by more or less of its posterior
surface, to the pharynx, sometimes resulting in complete occlusion of
the nasal portion of the pharynx.The constitutional symptoms of erysipelas of the pharynx are those that
attend the usual manifestations of external erysipelas, the febrile
phenomena, epigastric pain, nausea, and so on, being increased in
severity.There will be great pain and difficulty of deglutition.If
there be serious oedema, symptoms of suffocation will occur.Laryngitis
will be indicated by pain referred to the larynx.The duration of the
disease varies from forty-eight hours to a week, rarely longer.Death
may occur within two or three days from oedema of the larynx or from
other causes frequently indiscernible.Resolution usually takes place
in those cases which recover.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis rests upon the conditions already described
under the heads of Pathology and Symptomatology.Under ordinary
circumstances it presents no difficulty, but during the prevalence of
epidemics of scarlatina or diphtheria even the mildest sore throat
demands careful attention and frequent inspection until the exclusion
of the graver maladies may be positively determined.The greatest
difficulty will present in cases of common membranous sore throat, for
it is sometimes impossible to make the differentiation from diphtheria,
especially as the vesicular stage is rarely seen.Sometimes, it is
said, it is possible to detect one or more of the small ulcers left by
the rupture of the vesicles; sometimes small isolated spots of false
membrane will by their transparency indicate recent formation, and by
their circular shape the previous existence of a vesicle (Peter, cited
by Mackenzie).The coexistence of cutaneous herpes is corroborative of
the diagnosis, but by no means an infallible sign.It must not be
forgotten in this connection that membranous sore throat may predispose
to an attack of diphtheria.In gangrenous sore throat the grayish-black
patches may be mistaken for the pseudo-membranes of diphtheria, but
their color is dark from the outset, while in diphtheria they become
dark only as the disease progresses.They always represent actual death
of the tissues, which is not an essential lesion of diphtheria.Swelling of the cervical glands is unusual.Finally, the characteristic
odor of gangrene is almost unmistakable.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is favorable in catarrhal pharyngitis and in
the milder forms of the phlegmonous, non-specific, ulcerative, and
{397} common membranous varieties.It is unfavorable in intense
suppurative pharyngitis, though cases often get well.In gangrenous
pharyngitis the prognosis is extremely grave, but recovery is not
impossible.In traumatic pharyngitis the prognosis will of course
depend upon the nature and extent of the injury, being not unfavorable
if this be confined to the pharynx, though even in limited cases there
may be stenosis or other ill results from cicatrization.Erysipelatous
pharyngitis is of grave prognosis when the result of extension of the
disease from the face, but recovery is frequent when the pharyngeal
disease is primary.TREATMENT.--The treatment of superficial pharyngitis is very simple.Unless the case be so light that no special medicinal treatment seems
advisable, the patient should be confined to a bed or lounge to secure
rest, a light coverlid being thrown over the body to equalize the heat
of the surface.If a meal has recently been taken, a mild emetic is
often of service to empty the stomach and save the labors of digestion.A gentle laxative or, if the patient be of costive habit, a saline
purge is indicated to facilitate the passage of matters already in the
intestinal canal.In cases of actual constipation a drastic cathartic
may be required.If there be considerable pain a small dose of morphine
may be advantageously combined with the aperient.If frequent pulse or
high temperature exist, especially in severe cases, tincture of
aconite, in doses of one or two drops every hour or two hours at first,
will be useful.As soon as any marked effect has been produced the
aconite may be discontinued or the intervals between administrations
lengthened.Locally, the free use of demulcent drinks, and of pellets
of ice when cold is agreeable, will relieve the pain in the throat and
sometimes repress excessive secretion.Cold compresses to the neck
anteriorly are often soothing, and sponging the entire surface of the
body with tepid water, acidulated or alcoholized, will allay the
intense heat of the skin.Very
often the emetic, rest, and regulation of diet will constitute the
entire treatment required.When the local distress is very great, astringent lozenges (catechu,
krameria) may be allowed to dissolve in the mouth, or sprays of weak
solutions of alum or of carbolic acid may be propelled upon the mucous
membrane.Tannin, potassium chlorate, and cupric sulphate are often
used for this purpose.When the uvula is elongated or oedematous it is
often a constant source of irritation and discomfort.Scarification to
give vent to pent-up blood or puncture to allow the escape of effused
serum will afford prompt relief.In phlegmonous pharyngitis the treatment will necessarily be more
active.Here an early emetic is of great service.A saline laxative may
be administered every three or four hours for a day or two, each dose
containing a drop or two of the tincture of aconite, with the addition
of morphine if indicated by pain.Drop-doses of aconite at more
frequent intervals sometimes serve a better purpose.Inhalation of
steam, or of steam from water impregnated with hops, chamomile-flowers,
paregoric, compound tincture of benzoin, juice of conium, or the
aqueous extract of opium, belladonna, or conium, will afford great
relief, as will the frequent projection of sprays of warm water, simple
or slightly aromatized with cologne-water or with toilet vinegar.Warm
and moist applications externally are often very soothing.Gargling
entails too much pain to be of {398} service, but medicated sprays may
be used of aqueous solutions (twenty grains to the ounce) of tannin,
alum, zinc sulphate, or cupric sulphate, care being taken to guard
against the swallowing of any of these drugs.Powders of alum, tannin,
krameria, etc., diluted with liquorice, acacia, bismuth, lycopodium,
and the like, may be blown upon the parts, and are often efficient.Sodium bicarbonate frequently affords relief.The topical application
of silver nitrate is rarely practicable and generally unnecessary.When the inflammatory process is of a higher grade and not likely to
yield to purely medicinal treatment, leeching or venesection may be
employed, but should not be resorted to without urgent reason.The
recognition of abscess is an indication for its immediate discharge by
incision or aspiration.In suppurative cases quinia and iron should be
given in large doses.The general treatment is like that of simple sore
throat.When liquid food cannot be swallowed, nourishment by enema is
requisite.Efforts at deglutition should be spared as much as possible,
and with this view medicines which can be administered by inhalation,
by enema, or by hypodermatic injection are to be preferred.In pharyngeal sore throat, whether catarrhal or phlegmonous, depending
on rheumatic or gouty diathesis, salicylic acid or the salicylates will
prove useful, either alone or in conjunction with other measures.The treatment of ulcerative pharyngitis is practically the same as that
recommended for phlegmonous pharyngitis.Antiseptic gargles may be used
locally, but as a rule the pain is so great that inhalations of
soothing vapors, as before recommended, will answer a better purpose.When the process is very acute fragments of ice will be most useful.Ice to the head will afford relief to pain.A little good wine, with
quinia and iron, comprises the medicinal measure requisite.Gangrenous pharyngitis calls for the most active and supporting
treatment.Eggs, milk, cream, nutritious soups (up to the limits of the
patient's capacity for swallowing, and by enema when necessary),
quinia, tincture of the chloride of iron, and alcohol in large doses,
are indicated.Agents to destroy
diseased tissue promptly and prevent the extension of the gangrenous
process, such as bromine, strong nitric or hydrochloric acid, acid
solution of mercuric nitrate, or caustic potassa, are to be thoroughly
applied, in the hope of exposing a healthy surface beneath which will
heal by granulation.When this treatment is unsuccessful or too
hazardous, as in cases where the blood-vessels are probably involved,
we can only palliate the symptoms by applying weak solutions of acids
and astringents, to which opium may be added, relying on constitutional
measures for restraining the destructive process.Washes and sprays of
potassium chlorate, eucalyptol, thymol, hydrogen peroxide, etc., or the
agents employed in common sore throat, are often agreeable to the
patient, and may be useful in restraining fetor, but they have no
direct therapeutic influence on the progress of the disease.If the
ulceration is extending into the vicinity of the great vessels of the
neck, measures for compression should be at hand, in the use of which
the nurse should be instructed, and preparations be made to facilitate
ligation of the carotid artery in an emergency.Tracheotomy may be
necessitated by oedema of the larynx.The deformities resulting from
gangrenous sore throat in cases that recover usually require surgical
treatment.{399} Traumatic pharyngitis must be treated on general principles.When
due to contact of caustic or corrosive substances, an attempt may be
made to neutralize the effects by a chemical antidote, but the
physician is usually summoned too late to accomplish much in this
manner.Morphine should be given in full doses, hypodermatically.Insufflations of morphine in powder, soothing inhalations, fragments of
ice in the mouth, cold compresses, and, where possible, oleaginous
drinks, are indicated to relieve topical distress.Rectal alimentation
should be resorted to where the difficulties of deglutition are at all
great.If symptoms of suffocation occur, tracheotomy must be performed.The results of traumatic pharyngitis require treatment according to
their special indications.Erysipelatous pharyngitis is to be treated by the administration, by
enema if necessary, of large doses of quinia, tincture of the chloride
of iron, brandy, and diffusible stimulants.Alimentation is to be kept
up by mouth or rectum, as may be necessary, with as much food as can be
given containing the most nutrition in the smallest bulk possible.Locally, a strong solution of silver nitrate (sixty grains to the
ounce) should be so applied as to cover a margin of unaffected
structures.Extension to the
larynx demands scarification or tracheotomy.When the diagnosis of common membranous sore throat can be made out
with certainty, there is nothing calling for special treatment, but the
treatment pursued in ordinary sore throat may be generally followed
with advantage.When fetor exists, as during the detachment of patches
of exudation, antiseptic and detergent sprays may be employed.Solutions of borax, boric acid, carbolic acid, potassium chlorate,
potassium permanganate, etc.In some individuals,
especially strumous and tuberculous subjects, there is a constitutional
proclivity to chronicity or to the recurrence of the peculiar
manifestations.More active measures will be required in these cases.Locally, frequent application of the dilute acids (_i.e._ every day or
two) affords the most satisfactory results.Internally, iron and
cinchona preparations should be administered.Opium in small doses has
a special application--not as a narcotic, but as a gentle stimulant or
nervous tonic.Nux vomica or arsenic may be employed for a similar
purpose.The diet should be highly nutritious and easily assimilable.Unnecessary exposure should be avoided, and supporting measures
generally, hygienic, as well as medicinal, should be persisted in.Membranous pharyngitis sometimes exhibits a tendency to phagedaena.The
treatment for gangrenous sore throat is then indicated.It may invite
an attack of diphtheria or the diagnosis may be in doubt.In that case
the prudent course is to treat it as diphtheria, but to avoid the
recommendation for diphtheria of some indifferent remedy, during the
exhibition of which a case of membranous sore throat has recovered.When extension to the larynx occurs threatening suffocation,
tracheotomy to avert death should be performed, as in croup or
diphtheria.The sore throats of the exanthemata, of typhoid fever, etc., are to be
treated on the general principles applicable to catarrhal or
phlegmonous pharyngitis.Oedema or tumefaction, as in malignant
scarlatina, of a sufficient extent to obstruct respiration, is to be
relieved by scarification, and when this is inefficient resort must be
had to tracheotomy.The sore {400} throats caused by drugs are to be
treated first by removal of the cause, and afterward according to the
special indications.DEFINITION.--An acute ulcerative pharyngitis due to infiltration with
miliary and granular tubercle and the consequent destructive
metamorphosis.SYNONYMS.--Acute tuberculous sore throat, Acute tuberculous
pharyngitis, Tuberculosis of the pharynx, Phthisis of the pharynx.HISTORY.--Only of late years has tuberculosis of the pharynx been
distinctly recognized as a tuberculous disease.The tubercular sore
throat or pharyngitis described by Green of New York, and other authors
following him, is an affection of entirely different character, and not
tuberculosis at all.The chronic tuberculous sore throat of advanced
tuberculosis is likewise a different affection clinically, though of
the same histological character.To the late Isambert[2] of Paris belongs the credit of definitively
recognizing the specificity of acute tuberculous sore throat or
pharyngitis, and to him likewise the credit of indicating its
differentiation from syphilitic sore throat, with which it had long
been confounded.To B. Fraenkel of Berlin[3] is likewise due the credit
of an accurate comprehension and elucidation of the clinical and
histological pathology of this disease.[Footnote 2: _Annales des Maladies de l'Oreille, du Larynx, etc._, vol.162; _Conferences cliniques sur les Maladies du Larynx et
des premieres Voices_, Paris, 1877, p.Woch._, Nov., 1876; _London Med.ETIOLOGY.--Acute tuberculous pharyngitis is quite a rare disease.Its
predisposing causes, in all probability, are identical with those of
acute tuberculosis.Its exciting cause, in some cases at least, is some
unusual exposure to cold and wet.It is not certain that the throat is
affected before the lungs; but if this be the case, it is certain that
the lungs become affected soon afterward.The disease occurs in young
children, Isambert having recorded a case at four and a half years of
age, but it is much more frequent in adolescents and young adults.It
is impossible, as yet, to assign the reason why the pharynx rather than
other structures undergoes tubercularization in these exceptional cases
of pharyngitis.Syphilis sometimes coexists in the adult certainly, and
it may be questioned whether hereditary taint may not be an important
factor in determining tuberculosis in a region so frequently ravaged by
syphilis.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--The local disease is essentially an
ulcerative pharyngitis or pharyngo-laryngitis, as may be, extremely
rapid in its progress, and terminating fatally within a few weeks, or a
few months at farthest.The ulcerative process usually begins on the
palatine folds or else on the lateral wall of the pharynx, thence
extending to the palatine folds, soft palate, uvula, and hard palate in
one direction, and toward the posterior wall of the pharynx in the
other.The uvula sometimes becomes thickened into a club-shaped,
gelatinous-looking mass, somewhat characteristic.Previous to
ulceration the mucous membrane is subjected to abundant infiltration
with miliary and granular tubercle just beneath the epithelial layer.Macroscopically, these infiltrated portions of {401} tissue present as
irregular chagrinated groups of patches, generally confluent, which
when abundant or prominent are liable to be confounded with syphilitic
patches.Just beneath the surface the collections of tubercle project
as little semi-transparent grayish nodules, in size and form recalling
the appearance of vermicelli-seeds or fish-eggs.They steadily increase
in volume and in number, lose their translucency, and finally undergo
disintegration into lenticular ulcers with caseous bottoms and
undermined hyperaemic edges.The ulcers extend steadily in periphery
and in depth, and coalesce by necrosis of intervening mucous membrane.Polypoid excrescences springing from the beds of the ulcers have been
described (Fraenkel).Collateral tumefaction takes place in some
instances, due, it is stated (Isambert), to infiltration of the tissues
by a gelatinous material, possibly a mucoid degeneration of the
connective tissue.The usual tendency of the disease, however, is to
incite atrophic metamorphosis of the adjacent tissues not undergoing
actual tubercularization.In many instances extension to the upper
portion of the larynx takes place; in some, extension to the vault of
the pharynx.Extension to the oesophagus, as has been remarked by
Mackenzie, and to the posterior nasal outlets, has not been noticed.Enlargement of the cervical lymphatic glands is quite common.Microscopic examination of the tissues of the pharynx has revealed
profuse infiltration with round cells--most frequently in the mucous
membrane and submucous connective tissue only, occasionally in the
muscular fibres likewise.The muscles sometimes undergo the fatty
degeneration, and the mucous glands both fatty and colloid
degeneration.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The chief and characteristic subjective symptom is
extreme pain in swallowing (odynphagia)--pain much more intense than in
other morbid processes in the same locality, and inexplicable by the
extent of the visible disease merely.Cough, adynamic fever, rapid emaciation, and so on are
present, as in acute tuberculosis generally.DIAGNOSIS.--It cannot be stated that the diagnosis is easy.The two
distinguishing characteristics are the exquisite pain in swallowing and
the absence of pus from the surface of the ulcers.The aspect of the
ulcers differs, furthermore, from that of syphilitic ulcers by the lack
of opalescence and of inflammatory areolae.The gray nodules in the
affected mucous membrane are different from what is observed in any
other disease.These points, with the history of the attack, the family
history, and the probable evidence of tuberculosis in the lungs, will
usually serve to discriminate the disease from syphilis, for which it
is most likely to be mistaken.In cases of doubt ophthalmoscopic
examination of the choroid and iris may reveal tubercle.The bacillus
tuberculosis has been found in the detritus from the ulcers (Guttman,
Gurovitch).The fact must not be ignored that syphilitic and
tuberculous pharyngitis may exist together.Febrile symptoms, typhoidal
in type, in a case of supposed syphilitic sore throat will most likely
be indicative of tuberculosis.PROGNOSIS.--The disease is rapidly fatal, apparently inevitably so.An
exceptional case has been recorded, however (Cadier[4]), living {402}
several years after the diagnosis had been made by Isambert and many
others.[Footnote 4: _Annales des Maladies de l'Oreille, du Larynx, etc._,
July, 1883, p.Death takes place by asthenia in from six weeks to six months;
occasionally within a fortnight from the apparent onset.TREATMENT.--The little that can be accomplished in the way of treatment
is limited to improving the diet and hygienic surroundings, with the
administration of such constitutional remedial agents as are given in
acute tuberculosis, and palliative treatment of the local suffering.For the latter purpose insufflations of iodoform and morphine are to be
recommended, two or three grains of the former with one-fourth to
one-half grain of the latter, once a day or oftener.Such insufflations
should be preceded by douches or sprays of sodium borate or
bicarbonate, to rid the parts of mucus and detritus.A drop or two of
carbolic acid, of eucalyptol, or of a solution of thymol may be
advantageously added for purposes of disinfection.Solution of hydrogen
peroxide (2 per cent.or weaker) is a very valuable agent for use in
spray or douche.It may be rendered more agreeable by the addition of a
few drops of some balsamic.When swallowing is impracticable, nourishment by enema is indicated,
with forced feeding by means of a catheter passed through the larger of
the two nasal passages into the oesophagus.DEFINITION.--A chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
pharynx, whether implicating the glandular structures or not, and
commonly associated with similar chronic inflammation of contiguous
structures.SYNONYMS.--Chronic sore throat, Chronic angina.Chronic pharyngitis presents in two varieties: 1, simple chronic
pharyngitis (chronic catarrhal pharyngitis, chronic catarrhal sore
throat), in which the disease does not affect, or affects but slightly,
the glandular structures of the mucous membrane; and 2, follicular
pharyngitis (granular pharyngitis, clergyman's sore throat), in which
groups of the follicular glands of the mucous membrane are enlarged,
and sometimes inflamed.ETIOLOGY.--The predisposing causes of chronic catarrhal pharyngitis are
those enumerated under the head of the acute form of the affection, and
the exciting causes are repeated attacks of the acute malady.The predisposing causes of chronic follicular pharyngitis are
overcrowding, and sedentary occupations; and the exciting causes are
chiefly improper use of the voice and exposure to local irritations,
mechanical and chemical, including too free use of condiments, tobacco,
and alcohol, gormandizing, and the alternations of hot food, cold
drinks, ices, and hot drinks at meals.It is not so often a direct
sequel of attacks of acute sore throat as a result of prolonged
catarrhal pharyngitis; and sometimes it appears to be chronic, so to
speak, from the outset.Both forms of chronic pharyngitis are frequently associated with
chronic inflammations of the mucous membranes elsewhere, particularly
of the nasal passages and of the stomach, and, to a less extent, of the
genito-urinary apparatus; the entire train of phenomena, in some
instances, {403} being due to passive congestion dependent upon
impaired cardiac power.Similarly, it presents at times as one of the
accompaniments of exophthalmic goitre.It is often associated with
phthisis, and is sometimes found in phthisical subjects prior to the
detection of the pulmonary disease.It is sometimes coincident with
chronic cutaneous eruptions, and may depend on the same causes, whether
dietetic or nervous.Uterine disturbances may give rise to chronic pharyngitis, probably by
reflex nervous influence, and so do other chronic and dispiriting
complaints.In like manner, depression of spirits and impairment of
bodily vigor from domestic, financial, and social chagrin provoke a
train of phenomena in which chronic pharyngitis may be a prominent
manifestation.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Simple chronic pharyngitis is a chronic
catarrhal inflammation of the mucous membrane and submucous connective
tissue of the pharynx, with irregular hyperplasia of all the
histological elements, chiefly affecting the epithelial layers and the
most superficial strata of the submucosa.The pharynx, the posterior
surface of the palate, and the pharyngo-palatine folds are the
structures most generally implicated, but the glosso-palatine folds,
the base of the tongue, and even the anterior surface of the palate,
are sometimes involved.At an advanced stage of the affection extension
may take place to the vault of the pharynx and the posterior nasal
outlets, and in occasional instances to the larynx.The initial hyperaemia of diffuse congestion finally leads to permanent
dilatation of tracts of capillaries varying in area and mode of
distribution, sometimes recalling the territorial outlines upon a map.The mucous membrane is bright red in color and irregularly thickened,
sometimes into prominent welts or folds.Hypersecretion takes place over the entire diseased surface, and there
is considerable desquamation of turbid epithelium, which sometimes
accumulates in masses.Glands are dilated and hypertrophied here and
there, but not in every instance, or if so indiscernibly, at least, to
the naked eye.In some cases enlarged follicles are very prominent in the
infra-tonsillar space, between the anterior and posterior palatine
folds, and along the lateral walls of the pharynx down toward the base
of the tongue.The circumvallate papillae may also be enlarged, and the
fungiform papillae are sometimes very prominent and deeply congested.In the folliculous variety of the disease the hyperplasia affects
chiefly the mucous glands and follicles, isolated or in groups,
together with zones of connective tissue surrounding them and the
epithelial investment of the mucous membrane in their immediate
neighborhood.A number of small projections, from the size of pinheads
to that of peas, mostly somewhat hemispheroidal, sometimes ellipsoidal
or quite irregular in configuration, stud the pharynx irregularly.When
clustered they are more apt to occupy the lateral angles of the
pharynx.In this locality indeed the chains of glands and their
enveloping mucous membrane sometimes present in longitudinal ridges
which simulate additional or adventitious post-palatine folds.The
projections are usually opaque, deeper in color than the surrounding
congested mucous membrane, and velvety from loss of squamous
epithelium.Sometimes they are translucent, as if filled with colloid
material, probably retained and degenerated secretion.{404} Very often
their contents undergo caseous degeneration, and sometimes even
calcification--a variety designated tubercular by Green, Gibb, and
others, but far different histologically from true tuberculosis of the
pharyngeal glands, which does occur occasionally in phthisical
patients.Delicate red lines of engorged capillaries usually surround the base of
these projections.There is great disposition to the accumulation of
viscid, discolored mucus on the surface of the mucous membrane.As the
disease progresses all the processes become more widely extended, until
finally nearly the entire pharyngeal and oral mucous membrane becomes
involved.The soft palate becomes relaxed and the uvula thickened and
elongated, sometimes to an extreme degree.Chronic folliculous
tonsillitis exists in many cases.When either form of chronic pharyngitis continues for a long while
unchecked, there may result atrophy of the glandular structures and
epithelial elements generally, giving rise to pharyngitis sicca or
atrophic pharyngitis (so-called dry catarrh).There is then but scanty
secretion, and this dries rapidly upon the surface of the thin mucous
membrane, which becomes rough, inflexible, and glazed.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Cough, expectoration, impairment of voice, dysphagia,
and uncomfortable sensations in the throat present in various degrees
according to the stage of the disease and the temperament of the
patient.Hemming and hawking to clear the throat often become habitual,
especially in cases associated with chronic internal rhinitis, being
provoked in many instances by secretory products which drop into the
pharynx or glide along its walls.It is sometimes important to
distinguish this habit from the cough of laryngeal or bronchial
irritation.In cases associated with chronic gastritis the loss of appetite and
consequent emaciation accompanying the symptoms of pharyngitis
sometimes lead friends of the patient to a mistaken diagnosis of
consumption; and when, as is not infrequent, chronic bronchitis also
coexists, even the physician may be misled.In many instances of chronic folliculous pharyngitis evidently of long
standing, and accidentally discovered at times to the surprise of the
patient, no history of the classical group of symptoms can be obtained.DIAGNOSIS.--The diffuse congestion of the mucous membrane and the
absence of marked involvement of the follicles are, with the history of
the case, the main discriminative features in the diagnosis of chronic
catarrhal pharyngitis.The regular or irregular masses of tissue
projecting beyond the general surface of the mucous membrane are the
distinguishing characteristics of chronic folliculous pharyngitis.The
vascular network of dilated capillaries mapping the surface into
numerous irregular small areas of different sizes is not peculiar to
either variety.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of chronic catarrhal pharyngitis is favorable
when no irremediable malady of body or mind exists.Much depends on the
practicability of improving the dietetic and hygienic environment of
the patient.The prognosis is likewise good in chronic folliculous
pharyngitis under favorable surroundings, so far as relief from
suffering is concerned; but the follicles, when long hypertrophied, so
rarely undergo absorption under any treatment that their destruction
becomes necessary--quite a different thing from their cure.The
enlarged follicles once destroyed, the collateral irritative
inflammation caused by {405} them usually subsides.Impairment of
voice, a result of the disease, may be remedied in young subjects, who
will learn to use the voice with the abdomen in distension; but much
improvement cannot be expected in old subjects and in those in whom the
disease has been produced by improper methods of declamation, which are
beyond correction.TREATMENT.--In chronic catarrhal pharyngitis constitutional treatment
adapted to the diathetic condition is required in the first instance.Alkaline laxatives are usually indicated by the irregularly coated
tongue and the tendency to costiveness.These may be advantageously
administered in half a pint of hot water one hour or so before meals,
with a view of washing the stomach free from accumulations of mucus,
epithelium, and retained products of digestion and decomposition, so
that its condition may be improved for the reception and digestion of
the ensuing meal.Topical medication of the throat is likewise
requisite.Mild astringents are
applicable, but strong astringents are often actually injurious.Silver
nitrate and cupric sulphate in stick or strong solution should not be
used; but sprays of dilute solutions (one or two grains to the ounce of
distilled water), twice or thrice a day, are often of service.Zinc
sulphate (five grains to the ounce) may be used in the same manner.Zinc chloride (ten grains to the ounce), carefully applied to the
surface daily with a broad brush or soft cotton wad, is a useful
remedy.Tannin in ether sometimes answers admirably, a delicate film
being left for some time on the surface.Solutions of bismuth nitrate
or borate in glycerin applied locally often relieve uneasiness.A broad
flat brush is the best instrument for making these applications, placed
low in the pharynx so as to paint the entire posterior wall by a single
movement from below upward.For home use, sprays, three or four times a day, of tar-water,
containing five or ten grains to the ounce, of sodium borate or
bicarbonate, or sodium, potassium, or ammonium chloride, or sodium,
potassium, or ammonium iodide, are soothing and efficacious, and much
superior to gargles.Demulcent lozenges
(gelatin, acacia, althaea, glycyrrhiza) slowly dissolved in the mouth
often relieve topical discomfort.Much more active treatment is required in chronic folliculous
pharyngitis.In recent cases of moderate
intensity the ordinary treatment for the catarrhal variety sometimes
suffices.In cases of long standing strong solutions of silver nitrate
(sixty to one hundred and twenty grains to the ounce), carefully
applied with the broad flat brush twice or thrice a week, are often of
great remedial effect.Iodine (one drachm to the ounce of glycerin),
alone or in combination with equal parts of carbolic acid, applied
daily, may be serviceable in cases unimproved by the silver nitrate.Dilatation of the capillaries may sometimes be benefited by
applications of ergot (fluid extract) or ergotin (grs.Enlarged follicles of long standing are rarely amenable to
astringent and alterant topical treatment.The agent to be used is a matter of indifference as a rule, and,
according to the taste or resources of the practitioner, may be the
solid silver nitrate, caustic potash, London paste, zinc chloride,
{406} or the incandescent cautery, whether heated by fire, hot naphtha,
or electricity.The sprays and lozenges already mentioned are useful in this variety of
pharyngitis also.They may be medicated with sedative ingredients
according to indications for the relief of pain and discomfort.In cases resisting the plan of treatment suggested mercuric chloride
may be successfully used, both internally (gr.1/16 two or three times
a day) and in spray, a drachm or less night and morning (one grain to
four ounces).External counter-irritation by repeated blistering over
the larynx and under the angles of the jaws is useful in some
instances.During treatment the voice should be used as sparingly as
practicable.In chronic atrophic pharyngitis the treatment, constitutional and
local, should be such as favors secretion from mucous
membranes--internally, cubeb, pyrethrum, calamus, xanthoxylum,
jaborandi, ammonium chloride; topically, sprays, four or more times a
day, of hot water, glycerin and water, ammonium chloride.Patients
sleeping with the mouth open should wear an apparatus, extemporized or
made to order, to keep the lower jaw closed in sleep.DEFINITION.--A specific inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
pharynx or of the mucous membrane and submucous tissues, the result of
syphilis, and often associated with like disease in contiguous
structures.SYNONYMS.--Pharyngitis syphilitica, Pharyngitis specifica, Syphilitic
sore throat, Syphilis of the pharynx.ETIOLOGY.--Contamination by syphilitic virus is the sole cause, whether
by direct inoculation or by systemic poisoning, hereditary or acquired.Direct inoculation proceeds from primary sores on the lips, tongue,
cheek, and hard palate, themselves the result of actual contact with
sores in other individuals.Initial sores have been seen upon the
tonsils, palatine folds, pharynx, and even the epiglottis.Direct
inoculation from secondary sores may be communicated by the
tooth-brush, blow-pipe, pipe-stem, trumpet, mouth-piece of
feeding-bottle, pap-boat, or similar article previously used by an
infected individual.Uncleansed surgical instruments convey the disease
in like manner.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Syphilitic pharyngitis--or, more
strictly speaking, syphilitic sore throat--occurs in all varieties,
primary, secondary, tertiary, and hereditary.Secondary manifestations
are the most frequent, and primary sores the most infrequent.The
primary sore is soft in some instances, and hard in others.Phagedaenic
ulceration may ensue.Secondary manifestations are usually bilateral,
and often symmetric in configuration and distribution.They appear from
a few weeks to a few months after infection, and are among the most
frequent early manifestations of secondary syphilis.The inflammatory
process begins in erythema, usually diffuse, often punctated, sometimes
in patches.It extends from above downward more frequently than in the
reverse direction, but may spread in any direction.The lesion
commences upon the soft palate and tonsils more frequently than {407}
on the pharynx, but may commence in any portion of the oro-guttural
cavity.Tumefaction ensues, with lividity of the surface.The
epithelial cells become distended; the resulting opalescence, somewhat
characteristic, eventually subsides into a central opacity, the true
mucous patch or condyloma latum.Mucous patches vary in size from mere
specks to large irregular surfaces, often the result of coalescences.They sometimes become red and granular and covered with purulent
products.Microscopically (Cornil), they consist of thickened
epithelium upon a base of proliferated lymphoid cells, which often
infiltrate the deeper tissues extensively.They may disappear in the
course of a few weeks by resolution and absorption.Sometimes
suppuration occurs in small superficial abscesses which discharge upon
the surface.Several abscesses discharging simultaneously in
coalescence, an extensive ulcer may result, which, in repair, leaves a
cicatricial trace of its site.Flat and circular bluish-white patches,
due to thickening of epithelium, appear after the first year of
constitutional syphilis, and may exist in association with the true
mucous patch.They bleed readily on rough handling, but rarely undergo
ulceration.Tertiary manifestations may present within a few months after infection
or not until many years.Gummatous infiltration of the connective
tissue, diffused or circumscribed (syphiloma), follows diffuse or
localized erythema, and then the gummata break down, discharge by
ulceration, and leave deep-seated irregular ulcers with undermined
edges and surrounded with inflammatory areolae.These manifestations
are much more frequent in the palate than in the pharynx, and the
ulcerative process often destroys the uvula and large portions of the
palate and palatine folds.When the pharynx and posterior surface of
the palate are both ulcerated, cicatricial adhesions are sometimes
inevitable, and thus serious stricture of the suprapalatine pharyngeal
canal may ensue.The lesion may be quite limited in extent or may
involve the entire pharynx.The ravages may become sufficiently
extensive to involve the vertebra and the skull or to perforate the
large blood-vessels.Cicatrization in the pharynx is vertical or
stellate as the rule, and the peculiar pallid lustre of the cicatrices
is quite characteristic of the syphilitic lesion.In many instances
secondary and tertiary manifestations commingle.Ulceration is then
more likely to extend superficially than in depth.Hereditary manifestations pursue much the same course as tertiary
manifestations.They usually occur before puberty, but are occasionally
delayed until after maturity.Deferred tertiary and late hereditary
manifestations sometimes present the characteristic ulceration of the
commingled secondary and tertiary disease; and this form of ulceration
is often incorrectly attributed to scrofulosis and to lupus.SYMPTOMATOLOGY, COURSE, DURATION, COMPLICATIONS, AND SEQUELAE.--The
subjective symptoms of syphilitic pharyngitis are those of erythematous
and ulcerative pharyngitis of like grade, except that there is very
little pain.The course is chronic unless specific treatment be
instituted, when prompt repair may be expected unless the general
health has been much undermined.The
manifestations subside under treatment, and recur if it is not
sufficiently prolonged.Complications occur with similar manifestations
of syphilis in adjacent or contiguous or distant structures, as may be.The most frequent sequel in neglected cases is cicatricial stricture.{408} DIAGNOSIS.--Bilateral inflammation in symmetric distribution is
very characteristic of syphilis.Irregular ulcers with undermined
borders and surrounded by inflammatory areolae are similarly
characteristic.Acknowledged history of syphilis or the detection of
syphilitic manifestations elsewhere serves to confirm the diagnosis.In
cases of doubt a few days' treatment with specific remedies in large
doses will almost invariably serve to clear up the diagnosis.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis as to life is good unless the ulcerations
have become so extensive as to threaten perforation into blood-vessels
or the patient has become greatly debilitated.The prognosis as to
freedom from cicatricial adhesions and stricture is not good in the
presence of lesions which have destroyed large territories of tissue,
even under very careful management.TREATMENT.--Specific medicines in positive doses constitute the most
effectual treatment.Extensive ulcerative tertiary and hereditary lesions are peculiarly
susceptible to large doses (30 to 90 or more grains daily) of potassium
iodide, under the influence of which they often heal without any local
applications whatever.As soon as a positive impression has been
produced the dose may be diminished.The parts should be kept clean and
comfortable by periodic douching with sprays of alkaline solutions, or,
what is still more serviceable, with a ten-volume solution of hydrogen
peroxide diluted with one or more parts of distilled water.The best
local application to the edges of the pharyngeal syphilitic ulcers is
the solid cupric sulphate.Chromic acid (1:8) is a serviceable local
stimulant to indolent ulcers.Necrosed fragments of bone should be
removed.Should any impediment to respiration take place during
administration of the iodides, oedema of the larynx may be suspected,
and should be looked for.Professional supervision is requisite for
many months after the lesions have healed.Cicatricial sequelae of
stricture require surgical interference.{409}

DISEASES OF THE OESOPHAGUS.BY J. SOLIS COHEN, M.D.DEFINITION.--Inflammation of the oesophagus.SYNONYMS.--Inflammatory dysphagia, Inflammation of the gullet.Oesophagitis may be acute or chronic.Either form may be idiopathic,
deuteropathic, or traumatic.DEFINITION.--Acute inflammation of the gullet.SYNONYM.--Oesophagitis acuta.HISTORY.--Until the publication in 1829 of a thesis by J. T. Mondiere
entitled _Recherches sur l'Inflammation de l'Oesophage, et sur quelques
points de l'anatomie pathologique de cet organ_, little study had been
devoted to acute inflammation of the oesophagus; and since that time
Mondiere's researches have been largely utilized by subsequent writers.It has been taken for granted that Galen's mention of pain in the
oesophagus[1] has indicated his recognition of the disease.Fernel[2]
mentions phlegmon of the oesophagus; Honkoop[3] describes inflammation
of the oesophagus; J. P. Frank[4] describes an oesophageal angina; and
Joseph Frank[5] seems to have been the first author to use the term
oesophagitis.Since the publication of Mondiere's monograph the
principal systematic descriptions have been those of Hamburger[6] Von
Oppolzer[7] Zenker and Ziemssen[8] Luton,[9] and Bernheim.[10]

Paris, 1877, vol.Encyclopediques des Sciences medicales_, Paris,
1880, vol.ETIOLOGY.--Acute oesophagitis is quite a rare disease.It occurs
idiopathically, deuteropathically, and traumatically--traumatically far
the most {410} frequently, and idiopathically least frequently.It is
doubtful whether any special predisposing causes of oesophagitis can be
indicated.Nevertheless, infancy has been so cited by some authors
(Mondiere, Billard, Behier, and Steffan).Slight idiopathic
catarrhal--or rather erythematous--oesophagitis occasionally ensues in
the adult from sudden or prolonged exposure to cold and moisture, and
under such circumstances may sometimes be regarded as rheumatic in
origin, subsiding after a few hours' continuance, to be immediately
succeeded by manifestations of articular rheumatism, acute or subacute,
as in some analogous examples of rheumatic pharyngitis.Exceptionally,
severe oesophagitis may follow a simple cold (Noveene, cited by
Bernheim), or presents as an extension of sore throat, the result of
cold (Graves[11]).It is induced also by the habitual use of very hot
drinks and food, and occasionally by the opposite extremes, the use of
very cold articles of food and drink (Mondiere, Bourguet, Hamburger).The abuse of tobacco and alcohol is alleged as quite a frequent cause
of mild oesophagitis, usually occurring, however, in association with
pharyngitis from the same causes.Journ._, 1836-37, No.172, and
_Clinical Lectures_, Dublin, 1864, p.Oesophagitis sometimes follows the deglutition of irritating medicines
or moderately caustic poisonous substances not sufficiently acid to
produce veritable traumatic oesophagitis.Mercury, codeina, and
particularly tartar emetic, are cited as capable of exciting
oesophagitis.Large doses of tartar emetic, as formerly administered in pneumonia
(Laennec[12]), sometimes produced a peculiar form of pustulous
oesophagitis, not unlike the pustulous oesophagitis sometimes occurring
as part of the local manifestations of small-pox.[Footnote 12: _Traite de l'Auscultation medicale, etc._, Paris, 1837,
vol.560, illustrated; Laboulbene, _Anatomie pathologique_, and
_Nouveau Dict.370, illustrated;
Von Oppolzer, _op.Deuteropathic catarrhal oesophagitis occurs sometimes as an extension
of catarrhal pharyngitis on the one hand, and of catarrhal gastritis on
the other.It also occurs in scarlet fever, measles, and typhus fever.It is likewise consecutive to the various diseases and surgical lesions
of the tube itself.Parasitic oesophagitis occurs as an extension of
parasitic stomatitis or thrush.Deuteropathic circumscribed phlegmonous
oesophagitis is sometimes produced by extension of inflammation from
softened caseous bronchial glands at the bifurcation of the trachea,
and by pressure from mediastinal tumors, aneurism of the aorta, etc.Pseudo-membranous oesophagitis is almost always deuteropathic.It has
been encountered chiefly in association with pseudo-membranous
pharyngitis or diphtheria, and with croupous pneumonia, but likewise in
enteric and typhus fever, in cholera and in dysentery, in measles,
scarlatina, and small-pox, in nephritis, tuberculosis, carcinoma, and
pyaemia.In a case of hysteria, to be mentioned later, the entire epithelial
coat of two-thirds of the oesophagus was discharged by emesis.In this
respect the local disease--in that instance at least--resembles
pseudo-membranous enteritis.Traumatic oesophagitis is produced by the deglutition of corrosive
substances, which destroy portions of the mucous membrane in their
passage or excite a suppurative inflammatory process, or is produced by
the {411} passage of foreign bodies of sharp and irregular contour, or
by the passage of surgical appliances, whether used for actual
operations or for explorations merely.In rare cases traumatic oesophagitis is the result of wounds with
firearms or other weapons.Phlegmonous oesophagitis may be the result of disease or injury of the
interior of the oesophagus, or of its external coat by extension of
disease from tissues surrounding it.Foreign bodies, arrested in the
oesophagus or wounding it in their passage to the stomach; injuries
from surgical appliances, exploratory or operative, employed in
treatment for foreign bodies in the tube or in cases of stricture and
morbid growth; and chemical irritants swallowed by accident or
design,--are the chief causes in the former class of cases; but
pustulous and pseudo-membranous oesophagitis must likewise be regarded
as occasional causes.The causes operating upon the exterior of the
tube primarily are suppurative laryngitis and tracheitis, tumefaction
and softening of bronchial and tracheal lymphatic glands, and caries of
the spine.Isolated cases have been attributed to emboli in connection
with valvular diseases of the heart (Parenski, cited by Daton), and to
fits of anger (J. Frank and Rigal, cited by Daton).In certain cases
the cause is unassignable, and is then usually attributed to some
dyscrasia, syphilis in particular.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Acute oesophagitis presents both as a
diffused inflammation and a circumscribed process, annular or irregular
in contour.It does not appear from the post-mortem records consulted
that any special portion of the tube is particularly liable to
circumscribed inflammation, though the lower fourth appears most
frequently affected.The inflammatory process may be simply superficial
or erythematous, catarrhal or desquamative (Zenker and Ziemssen), or it
may be phlegmonous, and thus interest the submucous tissues as well as
the mucous membrane.This may terminate in abscess or in diffuse
suppuration with ulcerations.Both in diphtheria and in croupous pneumonia, pseudo-membranous
oesophagitis is an occasional complication; and the same process is
said to have been observed in typhus fever, measles, scarlatina,
cholera, pyaemia, dysentery, tuberculosis, and carcinoma (Von Oppolzer
and others).Pustulous oesophagitis occurs in small-pox, and occasionally follows
the use of tartar emetic in large doses.The morbid anatomy of acute idiopathic oesophagitis, though usually
detailed in descriptions of the disease, must be known by theory much
more than by demonstration, few examples coming under the inspection of
the pathologist in time to distinguish the progressive stages of the
inflammatory process, and still fewer being revealed by oesophagoscopy
during life.The lesions most frequently observed post-mortem are
thickening, softening, and desquamation of the epithelium, with very
scanty accumulations of viscid mucus here and there upon the mucous
membrane.The mucous membrane is seen to have suffered numbers of
pinhead or slightly larger superficial circumscribed erosions, rounded
or longitudinal, and likewise a few actual ulcerations.The follicles
of the mucous membrane are often both swollen and hypertrophied,
reaching the size of peas, especially in the upper portion of the tube.The desquamation of the epithelium usually takes place in small {412}
patches.One case, however, has been recorded (Birch-Hirschfeld[13]) in
which a young hysterical woman, after suffering three days with acute
oesophagitis without assignable cause, ejected by emesis a membranous
tube two-thirds of the entire length of the oesophagus, and shown under
examination to have been the completely detached epithelial coat of the
oesophagus, wholly normal in its upper layers and infiltrated with
agglomerated round cells in its lower layers.It was supposed that the
mass had been detached in consequence of acute subepithelial
suppuration.[Footnote 13: _Lehrbuch der pathologische Anatomie_, Ziemssen, 1877, p.In addition to swollen and hypertrophied follicles there may be some
evidence of ulcerative destruction of these follicles.Mondiere and
others declare that this folliculous inflammation and ulceration may
exist without any other change whatever in the remaining constituents
of the mucous membrane; and therefore this form of oesophagitis was
termed folliculeuse by Mondiere (folliculous oesophagitis).This form
of the disease has been observed in typhus fever, in croup (Mondiere),
and in tuberculosis.Ulceration of the oesophagus occurs, likewise, in
carcinoma and in oesophagitis from corrosive fluids, wounds, and other
injuries.In pseudo-membranous oesophagitis the exudation occurs usually in small
circumscribed gray-yellow or brownish flakes or stripes distributed
over different portions of the surface, more closely, however, at the
upper portion of the tube.Superficial erosions are sometimes observed
beneath these deposits, and occasionally ulcerations, at times
sufficient to give rise to severe hemorrhage (Zenker and Ziemssen).Usually the mucous membrane is but slightly hyperaemic.In some
instances pseudo-membrane is so massed in plugs as to occlude the
cavity of the tube, as with obturators.In cases associated with
pseudo-membranous gastritis the oesophageal manifestations are greatest
in the vicinity of the cardiac extremity.Somewhat allied to
pseudo-membranous oesophagitis, and apt to be confounded therewith, is
the parasitic deposit of the Oidium albicans in cases of thrush; in
connection with which subject this point has already received
attention.The pustules of small-pox may interest any portion of the mucous
membrane, but are most numerous at the upper portion of the tube.The pustules from tartar-emetic poisoning
are most numerous at the two extremities of the canal.It is contended
that the so-called pustules of variolous oesophagitis are really
superficial variolous ulcers, the antecedent specific lesions having
been lenticular papules merely, with abrasion of the softened
epithelial layer.[14] Variolous oesophagitis may excite an accompanying
catarrhal or pseudo-membranous oesophagitis.The local lesions, be they
pustular or ulcerous, heal without cicatrices.[Footnote 14: _Virchow's Deutsche Klinik_, 1858, No.306; Zenker
and Ziemssen, _op.Phlegmonous oesophagitis presents both as a diffuse and as a
circumscribed inflammation.Examined after death, there is abundant
purulent infiltration into the submucous connective tissue, which has
undergone destruction in portions of its extent.The infiltration
pushes the folds of mucous membrane outward to the interior of the
tube, and thus diminishes its calibre considerably when the
infiltration is annular.{413} The mucous membrane is congested,
ecchymosed, and covered with mucus, and has usually suffered
desquamation of portions of its epithelium.Ulcerations through the
mucous membrane will have taken place in some instances.Cicatrices
mark the location of ulcers which have healed.In the diffuse variety the oesophagus is inflamed and swollen, as a
whole, in proportion to the extent of the disease.In the circumscribed
variety the morbid appearances are circumscribed.It has been known to
continue into the stomach (Belfrage and Hederius, cited by Zenker and
Ziemssen), and to extend therefrom (Ackermann, _idem_).As described by Zenker and Ziemssen, chiefly from ten autopsies by
themselves and one by Belfrage and Hederius, phlegmonous oesophagitis
begins with a submucous purulent infiltration, transforming the areolar
tissue into an apparent layer of pus, although microscopic examination
shows the bundles of connective tissue to be intact at first.At a
later period they become really destroyed, leaving mere crevices filled
with pus.The mucous membrane, but little involved, may remain normal
or may present the evidence of catarrhal inflammation, desquamation of
epithelium, congestion, and slight deposits of mucus.The muscular
coat, intact to the unaided eye, under the microscope gives some
evidence of purulent infiltrations.The pus may finally escape through
the mucous membrane, in extensive infiltrations, at several points,
which give the parts a sieve-like appearance when the perforations are
closely grouped.Gangrene sometimes occurs as a result of intense phlegmonous
oesophagitis, but this is far more rare than the gangrene supervening
after injuries by caustic substances.Sometimes it results from
capillary embolism (Rokitansky, Virchow, cited by Luton, _op.SYMPTOMATOLOGY, COURSE, DURATION, TERMINATION, COMPLICATIONS, AND
SEQUELAE.--The main subjective symptoms of oesophagitis are pain and
difficulty in swallowing, with febrile phenomena superadded in severe
cases.In simple oesophagitis of mild character these symptoms may be
so slight as to be attributed to other causes or be disregarded
altogether.In most instances there is a dull, steady pain beneath the
sternum, some sense of impediment to deglutition or absolute pain in
swallowing (odynphagia), and occasional regurgitation of viscid, glairy
mucus, food, or acid products from the stomach.In severe cases the
substernal pain is more acute and more diffused, and is frequently
associated with pain between the scapulae and to the left side.This
latter pain may be attributable to acid from the stomach.Sometimes the
pain is described as acute, especially during the passage of large
boluses, particularly if they are very hot, or even very cold.The seat
of pain, however, does not always indicate the seat of inflammation,
even though the pain be always referred to the same locality.When the
cervical portion of the tube is implicated, tenderness may sometimes be
detected by external pressure or by special movements of the head and
vertebrae.The amount and character of the dysphagia vary greatly.Sometimes there
is a sense of impediment to the passage of food, solid or liquid, or
solid only, through and beyond the painful region.This sensation may
be accompanied or be followed at a brief interval by regurgitation of
food or mucus, or food enveloped with mucus, the latter in some
instances tinged with blood.The deglutition or the regurgitation may
be {414} accompanied by spasm of the muscular coat of the oesophagus.The dysphagia is not always due to tumefaction of the mucous membrane,
but usually in part to coexisting inflammation of the muscular coat or
infiltration between the sheaths of muscular fibres, paralyzing their
efforts at contraction.There are no subjective symptoms which permit discrimination between
desquamative catarrhal oesophagitis and folliculous oesophagitis.The
only symptom particularly indicating pseudo-membranous oesophagitis is
the expulsion of shreds of the membrane by hawking or by emesis; but a
strong inference is justifiable when the ordinary symptoms of
oesophagitis occur in cases of pseudo-membranous pharyngitis or
croupous pneumonia.Phlegmonous oesophagitis is indicated by the presence of pus or of dead
mucous membrane in the matter regurgitated or vomited.In severe cases
there is considerable febrile reaction.In children, convulsions may
supervene from reflex irritation conveyed along the pneumogastric
nerve.The course of acute catarrhal oesophagitis is, as a rule, short, the
pain and dysphagia usually subsiding in a few days, with complete
resolution and no unfavorable sequelae.When due to obstruction, the
course is indefinitely prolonged.Sometimes it subsides into a mild or
unsuspected chronic oesophagitis.In the symptomatic oesophagitis of
febrile diseases, the course is longer and unequal.In severer forms
and in phlegmonous oesophagitis, the disease may be protracted by
suppuration, abscess, gangrene, perforation of the oesophagus, and
other complications.It often terminates fatally--in three or four days
in some cases--sometimes under symptoms of collapse.Cases may recover
without important sequelae, but stricture very often results from
cicatricial complications.Chronic oesophagitis is a more frequent
sequel of the phlegmonous variety than of the catarrhal.It, in its
turn, may give rise to dilatation of the oesophagus, annular or
diverticular, from detention of food and consequent pressure.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis will rest upon the interpretation of the
coexistence of a certain number of the symptoms mentioned.Idiopathic
phlegmonous oesophagitis may readily be mistaken for dorsal myelitis by
the location of the pain--the more so that the spinal disease is
occasionally attended with spasm of the oesophagus, and the myelitis by
difficulty in deglutition; but the differentiation may be determined by
the inability to produce oesophageal pain by pressure made along the
dorsal vertebrae.In deuteropathic or traumatic phlegmonous
oesophagitis, the history of the attack will indicate the probable
nature of the malady, and prevent the mistake.Diffused oesophagitis is
suspected when the general pain or the painful dysphagia appears to
extend along the entire tract of the oesophagus, or at least a large
portion of it.Circumscribed oesophagitis is usually indicated by odynphagia at a
certain point of the tube after completing the act of deglutition.The
location of the inflammation can sometimes be determined by
auscultation of the descent of the alimentary bolus or of a swallow of
water (Hamburger), which may yield evidence to the ear of arrest or
impediment to its passage.Auscultation of the oesophagus, however, is
less useful in acute oesophagitis than in stenosis, stricture, and
mechanical obstruction.When available in oesophagitis, the normal
sound of the passage of water down {415} the gullet becomes masked, and
accompanied by that of regurgitative ascent of small bubbles of air.Sometimes there is a slight friction sound during the act of
deglutition itself.In circumscribed oesophagitis, especially when
annular, as is most frequently the case, sounds are heard attributable
to marked obstruction to the descent of the bolus.Abscess cannot be
positively diagnosticated until after its rupture and the appearance of
pus in the matters regurgitated or otherwise expelled from the
oesophagus.Catheterism of the oesophagus is hardly justifiable as a method of
diagnosticating oesophagitis, though proper enough when it becomes
important to determine the locality of attendant obstruction.It is important that inflammation of the oesophagus be differentiated
from spasm, stricture, stenosis, carcinoma, and other oesophageal
maladies; nearly all of which present the same main subjective
symptoms--pain and impediment to deglutition.The history of the case
is in itself a guide of great diagnostic value, often quite sufficient
for the purpose; but in its absence or retention other data must be
gathered.Spasm of the oesophagus is most frequent in neurotic subjects.It
is not a febrile affection.It is often overcome in a moment by
catheterization.Stricture presents often an additional symptom of oesophagitis, the
regurgitation of mucus and food.The differentiation is made, in cases
of doubt, by the passage of the bougie or catheter.Carcinoma of the oesophagus, while recent, may present much similitude
to oesophagitis, but as the case advances, the glandular involvements,
the cachexia, the expulsion of cancerous fragments, and the vomiting of
blood seem sufficient to prevent further confusion.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is favorable in acute catarrhal oesophagitis,
the manifestations often subsiding within a few days; sometimes,
indeed, within a few hours, and that, too, without special medication.It is therefore largely dependent on the cause of the oesophagitis and
the severity and extent of the malady.The only unfavorable
prognostications arise from the impediment to nourishment and the
complications which may ensue.In presumptive pustulous oesophagitis from the use of preparations of
antimony, the manifestations usually subside within a few days upon
suspension of the remedy.Sometimes, however, these cases terminate
fatally.Pseudo-membranous oesophagitis is usually fatal in its significance,
and the same may be said of the pustulous or ulcero-papular
oesophagitis of small-pox.Phlegmonous oesophagitis is of grave augury, though many cases recover.It may prove fatal within two or three days, though life is usually
prolonged for several days, even in fatal cases.When not fatal,
abscesses are apt to form, which, discharging internally or externally,
are followed by stricture or fistulae.Both ulcerative oesophagitis and intense catarrhal oesophagitis may
terminate in chronic thickening of the walls of the oesophagus and in
cicatricial adhesions more or less extensive.TREATMENT.--Mild oesophagitis requires no special treatment.The
patient should be kept within doors, and be fed on rice-water, {416}
barley-water, and other mucilaginous articles of diet, so as to avoid
all sources of local irritation.These drinks are usually better borne
hot than cold, but sometimes cold is quite agreeable.When cold can be
well borne the frequent deglutition of pellets of ice is useful as well
as agreeable, and ice-cream becomes a medicinal article of diet.In severe cases the measures indicated become still more requisite, and
the use of the voice should be restrained in addition.All unnecessary
efforts at deglutition should be avoided, and anodyne medicaments
(opium, hyoscyamus, belladonna) should be added to the demulcent food
or beverages.When swallowing is impracticable or very painful,
nutriment should be given by the bowel, and medicines by the bowel or
by the skin.Thirst may be allayed by retaining fragments of ice in the
mouth from time to time, by rinsing the mouth with simple or acidulated
water, by sucking the juice of acid fruits, or by allowing compressed
effervescent lozenges to dissolve slowly in the mouth.The external application of cold compresses, continuously or in
frequent renewals, is also indicated.Febrile phenomena require ordinary antiphlogistic medication.When this
is impracticable, the indications may be met by using the cold bath or
the wet sheet, and by administering antipyretics hypodermatically.Traumatic oesophagitis from a foreign body requires removal of the
object if still in the oesophagus; that from swallowing alkalies is met
by the use of acidulated beverages (vinegar and water, Orfila); that
from swallowing acids, by the use of alkaline drinks, of which the
handiest is usually soap and water.As soon as they can be procured
this may be changed for lime-water and calcined magnesia.Theoretically, the carbonates of the alkalies are indicated likewise,
but it is contended (Hamburger, Oppolzer) that the extrication of the
carbonic acid gas renders mechanical rupture of the corroded oesophagus
imminent.Subsequently, fresh water should be freely drunk, or be
injected into the oesophagus when swallowing is impracticable.The
subsequent treatment is to be instituted upon general principles.DEFINITION.--A chronic inflammation of some of the tissues of the
oesophagus.SYNONYM.--Oesophagitis chronica.ETIOLOGY.--Chronic oesophagitis is sometimes a sequel of the acute
affection.More frequently it is the result of excessive use of strong
alcoholic beverages or of very hot drinks.It is said to be sometimes
the result of passive congestion in chronic pulmonary and cardiac
diseases.It follows the prolonged sojourn of foreign bodies in the
oesophagus.It exists in connection with carcinoma of the oesophagus,
with dilatation, and with stricture of the oesophagus, and with other
diseases obstructing the tube externally or internally.It is sometimes
produced by caries of the vertebrae, both scrofulous and syphilitic,
and by the pressure of aneurismal and other tumors.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Hypertrophy of the mucous membrane of
the oesophagus, of the submucous connective tissue, and {417} even of
the muscular coat, are the processes which take place in chronic
oesophagitis, especially when it has been of long continuance.This
hypertrophy, when at or near the cardiac extremity, may produce
stricture (Rokitansky and others), with subsequent dilatation of the
oesophagus from its frequent and prolonged distension by food which
should have passed on at once into the stomach.On post-mortem examination the main evidences of disease are most
frequent in the lower third of the organ.Its folds of mucous membrane
are thick and prominent, dirty red, brownish-red, or gray, as may be,
abraded here and there, and covered with viscid muco-purulent
secretions.Abscesses and ulceration are not uncommon in cases due to
prolonged pressure or extension of disease from outside the tube.Such
ulceration has not uncommonly been the source of serious hemorrhage.Diffuse inflammation of the peri- or retro-oesophageal connective
tissue has been noted as an occasional sequel to the inflammatory
process in the walls of the oesophagus.SYMPTOMATOLOGY, ETC.--The symptoms of simple chronic oesophagitis are
similar in the main to those of mild acute oesophagitis, but are often
still more moderate, and therefore likely to be overlooked.In severe
cases the symptoms are chiefly those of the disease, usually stenotic,
which has excited the chronic inflammatory process.The course is
prolonged and the duration indefinite.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis rests on the same principles and inferences
as in acute oesophagitis, the symptoms, however, being of longer
duration.The auscultatory signs of arrest or impediment in the descent
of the solid or liquid bolus are usually more definite than in acute
oesophagitis.The same differentiations are available in excluding
spasm, stricture, and malignant diseases.The use of the sound or
catheter is much more justifiable than in the acute variety.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is usually unfavorable, on account of the
great liability to stricture and occlusion from organization of
inflammatory products.TREATMENT.--Chronic oesophagitis may require both local and
constitutional treatment.The constitutional treatment will have to be
adapted to the cause of the disease.If due to obstructed circulation
in consequence of valvular disease of the heart, digitalis and remedies
of its class will be indicated.If due to obstructive pulmonic disease,
chloride of ammonium and alkaline remedies will be indicated.Syphilitic inflammation requires the mixed treatment, with mercuric
chloride and potassium iodide or their equivalent.Iodides, indeed, are
often required in non-specific cases, and are useful particularly in
ordinary circumscribed oesophagitis.Under all conditions alcoholic
beverages should be interdicted, and so should the deglutition of all
irritating food and drink.Mild, bland, and mucilaginous substances
should be largely employed in food and drink.The copious use of
carbonic-acid waters is also recommended (Oppolzer).Sinapisms and
revulsives to the side of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae are also
recommended by some writers (Oppolzer).The topical treatment consists in the systematic use every few days of
aqueous solutions of astringents (alum, tannin, ten to thirty grains to
the ounce) or alterants (compound solution of iodine, twenty minims to
the {418} ounce) passed gently over the diseased surfaces by means of a
piece of soft surgical sponge securely attached to a flexible staff.Severe pain of rather sudden occurrence is usually attributable to
circumscribed ulceration, and is best treated by superficial
cauterization, as above, with a dilute solution of silver nitrate (ten
grains to the ounce).These remedies may be used in the form of
ointments of the same strength smeared upon a rather large flexible
bougie.To relieve pain and sense of constriction belladonna or
stramonium ointment, applied in the same manner, sometimes fulfils a
useful indication.Before making these applications attempts should be
made by auscultation to locate the seat of disease or obstruction.After subsidence of the disease, occasional catheterization may be
practised at intervals of several weeks, in order to detect any
recommencing stenosis.Ulcerations of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--Circumscribed destruction of portions of the mucous
membrane of the oesophagus, the result of inflammatory processes.ETIOLOGY.--Ulceration of the oesophagus occurs as a result of
inflammation of the organ, as discussed in connection with
Oesophagitis, and the cause varies with the character of the
oesophagitis, whether idiopathic, traumatic, or symptomatic of disease
elsewhere.Diseases, constitutional or local, provocative of ulceration
of the oesophagus, usually implicate some portion of either the
alimentary or the respiratory tract.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The symptoms are in the main those described under
Acute Oesophagitis, particularly the expulsion of sanguinolent products
or of unmixed blood.Perforation into the trachea is indicated by
expectoration of food or drink; perforation into the great vessels, by
haematemesis, usually fatal; and perforation into the mediastinum, by
emphysema and purulent cellulitis.When large or extensive ulcerations
have cicatrized they occasion symptoms of organic stricture.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Referring to the corresponding section
under Oesophagitis, attention may be directed here to the liability of
deep-seated ulcers of the oesophagus to perforate the gullet and
establish fistulae with the trachea, bronchi, mediastinum, aorta, and
carotid artery, according to the locality of the lesion.DIAGNOSIS.--The presence of blood in matters regurgitated or vomited
forms the chief diagnostic indication of ulceration of the oesophagus,
taken in connection with the usual symptoms of acute or chronic
oesophagitis.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is altogether dependent on the nature of the
disease which has given rise to the ulceration.TREATMENT.--The constitutional treatment will depend on the nature of
the disease which has occasioned ulceration.Ergot and turpentine are
administered in case of hemorrhage--the former best, perhaps,
hypodermatically.Attempts are sometimes made to cauterize the ulcer or
ulcers with nitrate-of-silver stick conveyed in a covered slotted
canula, to be exposed when the fenestrum reaches the ulcerated
locality, previously {419} determined by catheterization, or inferred
to be reached by the sensations of the patient.The practice is
uncertain in its manipulation and questionable in its results.Stricture of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--A constriction of the calibre of the oesophagus, whether
spasmodic or organic in character.This definition excludes stenosis
due to pressure from without.Spasmodic Stricture of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--A contraction of the muscles of the oesophagus, of
variable duration, causing partial or complete stenosis of the gullet
and interfering with the passage of food or of food and drink to the
stomach.SYNONYMS.--Oesophagismus, Spasm of the oesophagus, Cramp of the
oesophagus, Convulsive dysphagia, Spasmodic dysphagia, Spasmodic
stenosis of the oesophagus, <DW46> stricture of the oesophagus.HISTORY.--On this subject there is little of importance in medical
annals previous to the observations of Frederick Hoffmann,[15] and
little of importance subsequently save the observations of
Mondiere,[16] though numerous personal observations are on record, as
well as a number of excellent compilations in various monographs,
text-books, encyclopaedias, and dictionaries.[Footnote 15: _De spasmo gulae inferioris_, Halae, 1733; _De morbis
oesophagi spasmodicis_, Opera omnia, vol.[Footnote 16: "Recherches sur l'Oesophagisme ou Spasme de l'Oesophage,"
_Arch.ETIOLOGY.--Spasmodic stricture of the oesophagus is a neurosis often
hysterical.It is much more frequent in females than in males, and,
although observed in young subjects and less frequently in old ones, is
most common between the ages of twenty and fifty.It is sometimes
observed in several members of a neurotic family.It is often
associated with other evidences of neurosis, but sometimes constitutes
the sole manifestation.Sometimes
it can be traced to a fear of strangulation, induced primarily by some
accidental impediment to deglutition or the entrance of a foreign body.Strong mental emotion, such as the dread of hydrophobia after having
been bitten by a dog, sometimes produces the affection.It occurs in connection with organic lesions of the oesophagus, organic
lesions of the stomach, organic lesions of the larynx and trachea, and
organic lesions of the lungs, heart, large blood-vessels, and
perioesophageal tissues, but likewise as a reflex disorder, with
lesions of distant organs, as the genito-urinary tract, the intestines,
the brain and spinal cord.Even pregnancy may produce reflex
oesophagismus.It sometimes occurs as a direct or reflex manifestation
of gout and of rheumatism.In a few instances it occurs as one of the
manifestations of tetanus and of hydrophobia.SYMPTOMATOLOGY, COURSE, DURATION, ETC.--The spasm may affect {420} the
oesophagus only, or may be associated with spasm of the muscles of the
pharynx.It is usually manifested in a sudden inability to swallow or
to complete the acts of deglutition.This may be transitory or may
continue for a number of hours.The relaxation of the spasm is
sometimes followed by the discharge of flatus and the copious secretion
of pale urine.The spasm may recur at irregular intervals or be more or
less distinctly intermittent.Sometimes it precedes every effort at
deglutition.In some instances it occurs only upon attempts to swallow
certain kinds of food, and the articles of food vary with different
patients.Cold viands sometimes produce spasm when warm and hot food is
tolerated.Consciousness of a liability to spasm increases the
dysphagia for the time being, or brings it on suddenly when this
liability had been forgotten.The spasm is sometimes painless and
sometimes painful.In some instances it is associated with partial
regurgitation of a mass of air (the globus hystericus).The dysphagia is rarely complete, instances in which no liquids can be
swallowed being infrequent.The aliment swallowed usually passes on
into the stomach, upon relaxation of the spasm, after a certain period
of detention varying from a number of seconds to many minutes.In cases
of prolonged or persistent spasm the aliment is usually rejected,
either at once or after a time, according as the contraction takes
place at the pharyngeal extremity of the oesophagus or lower down.When
rejected after some detention in the gullet, the aliments are usually
enveloped with mucus or followed by expulsion of mucus and of flatus.In some subjects the pain in swallowing is severe.Sometimes it is
associated with spasm of the diaphragm (hiccough), spasm of the
air-passages, palpitation of the heart, and syncope.The liability to spasm sometimes continues for years.Sometimes it
ceases permanently as suddenly and as unexpectedly as it began.The seat of the spasm is referred by the patient to different regions,
which in their totality comprise the entire extent of the oesophagus.In some patients the seat varies on different occasions.The actual
seat of any individual spasm is best determined by exploration with the
oesophageal bougie or by auscultating the oesophagus during the passage
of a bolus.It is most frequent perhaps at the upper extremity, and
then perhaps at the cardiac extremity.When habitually low down, there
is some liability to permanent distension of the oesophagus from
repeated retentions of food at the same place for hours together.In
some instances food is regurgitated from the oesophagus after its
retention for a day or even longer.When the spasm is high up, the
regurgitation may follow the act of deglutition almost immediately.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--The affection being usually a pure
neurosis, there is no oesophageal lesion to be cited.In some of the
few autopsies recorded, constriction has been noted without lesion of
tissue.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis is based on the sudden onset of the spasm
without assignable cause, its intermittent or recurrent character, its
manifestation in advance of the effort at deglutition, the symptoms of
regurgitation, the coexistence of some of the affections mentioned in
connection with its etiology, and on the satisfactory result of
exploration with the oesophageal bougie; which differentiates the
affection from organic stricture or mechanical obstruction.In
catheterization of the oesophagus {421} in cases of pure spasm,
although the sound is usually arrested at the seat of constriction, it
passes onward after a few moments by sudden relaxation of the spasm.Sometimes, indeed, the very first manipulation of this kind overcomes
the spasm permanently.In the absence of other indications the differentiation from spasm of
organic origin rests, in great measure, on the conservation of
nutrition, cases being few in which the spasm is persistent enough to
interfere so materially with the ingestion of aliment as to produce
emaciation.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is usually favorable in spasm of the
oesophagus, except in cases where the underlying malady is itself a
grave one.Patients do not die of neurotic spasm of the oesophagus.In
the majority of cases it is susceptible of cure within a few weeks,
sometimes much more promptly.Even when it continues for months or for
years there is little fear of permanent injury to the general health,
inasmuch as sufficient nutriment of some kind or other can be ingested
to sustain the patient.The duration of the affection depends upon the surroundings of the
patient, his amenability to treatment, and the existence or absence of
disease in the oesophagus or elsewhere.In cases dependent upon
diseased conditions in the oesophagus or elsewhere the character of the
disease controls the prognosis, both immediate and ultimate.Thus,
aneurism of the aorta, tuberculosis, ulceration of the larynx and
trachea, carcinoma of the stomach, tetanus, and hydrophobia present the
highest unfavorable indications.Purely neurotic cases are extremely
prone to recurrence.TREATMENT.--The treatment to be pursued will depend upon the nature of
the case.If due to organic lesion in the oesophagus or in some other
organ, the treatment will be directed to that affection, whatever it
may be.If due to emotional disturbance, therapeutic efforts will be
directed to their suppression or removal.If purely hysterical,
appropriate constitutional remedies for that condition will be
prescribed.These comprise asafoetida, valerian, camphor, musk, oxide
of zinc, bromides, belladonna, conium, and so on, best administered in
small doses at frequent intervals.Local treatment is almost always necessary, both for its beneficial
mechanical effects and for its emotional influence.This consists in
the systematic passage of the bougie; and it is by far the best
practice to insist upon the patient's submission to it without an
anaesthetic.In cases of intense hyperaesthesia, which are rare, and in
the initial exploratory passage of the instrument in highly excitable
or uncontrollable subjects, anaesthesia may be resorted to if there be
no contraindication.The mere passage of the bougie will often effect
immediate relaxation of the spasm.When required, the manipulation may
be repeated a few times at intervals of several days.Should the
passage of the bougie determine the stricture to be purely spasmodic,
the patient should be made to partake of food in the physician's
presence at first, and afterward under the supervision of an efficient
attendant, until it becomes evident that there is no absolute
impediment to the passage of food.The presence of the physician during
early attempts at taking ordinary food imparts such confidence in the
patient that he soon overcomes his dread of strangling and learns to
eat again as he should do.Meantime, it may be necessary from time to
time to pass the bougie just before food is taken.{422} In such cases
it is well to smear the instrument with ointment of belladonna, so as
to deposit it more or less along the entire tract of the oesophagus.Failing by these methods, success may follow the occasional passage, at
intervals of a few days, of a sponge probang saturated with a very weak
solution of iodine or of silver nitrate.Counter-irritation along the course of the pneumogastric nerve or along
the spine is sometimes useful.Electricity is sometimes employed to overcome the spasm; but
intra-oesophageal electrization of every kind is risky from the danger
of exciting fatal syncope from irritation of the pneumogastric nerve.This objection is not applicable to percutaneous electrization, save in
a much more limited degree.Caution is requisite even with external
manipulations along the tract of the pneumogastric nerve; and such
manipulations, therefore, should not be undertaken without sufficient
familiarity with the effects of electric currents in that situation.Taken all in all, the best results seem to follow the systematic use of
the bougie and enforced deglutition under the eye of an attendant in
whom the patient feels reliance can be placed in case the food should
"go the wrong way" or become impacted in the gullet.Organic Stricture of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--Diminution in the calibre of the oesophagus in consequence
of organic alterations in its walls, whether interstitial, cicatricial,
or malignant.SYNONYM.--Stenosis of the oesophagus.HISTORY.--As mentioned in connection with other affections of the
oesophagus, so with organic stricture: though much more has been
written on the subject, it is to the observations and publications of
Mondiere, so frequently cited, that we must credit medical literature
with a due appreciation of this topic.The last thirty years especially
have been prolific in the record of cases, and their study has been
further stimulated by the attention directed to the operation of
gastrostomy as a means of prolonging life in cases otherwise hopelessly
fatal.ETIOLOGY.--Organic stricture of the oesophagus is occasionally
congenital.As a rule, life is rarely prolonged under such conditions,
but cases are on record in which it has been preserved to quite
advanced age.Thus, in a female who died from inanition at fifty-nine
years of age, after lifelong symptoms of stricture (Everard Homes[17]),
there was an annular stricture behind the first ring of the trachea;
and in a male subject who died with pneumonia at seventy-four years of
age, after lifelong symptoms of stricture,[18] the stricture was found
at the cardiac extremity of the oesophagus, which was enormously
dilated its entire length above the constriction.Encyclopedique_, t. xiv.[Footnote 18: Wilks, _Path.130; Holmes, _The
Surgical Treatment of the Diseases of Infancy and Childhood_, 2d ed.,
p.In the majority of cases the stricture is due to cicatricial
obliteration of more or less of the calibre of the oesophagus, the
result of losses of substance following scalds produced by caustic
substances swallowed, mostly by accident and sometimes by design.Wounds of all kinds, {423} whether from the interior, as in the case of
foreign bodies and instruments of extraction, or from the exterior, as
in the case of surgical operations, wounds from firearms, and the like,
are apt in their cicatrization to give rise to this form of stricture.Though denied by some authorities, syphilitic disease of the oesophagus
is an undoubted cause of stricture.Setting aside disputed records of
older authorities, we may cite recent cases reported by Lancereaux,
West,[19] Wilks, Virchow, and Lublinski,[20] the latter-named going
deeply into the bibliography, pathology, and therapeutics of stricture
from syphilis.The author could add his personal testimony were it
requisite.[Footnote 19: _The Lancet_, 1872.]20, 1883; _London Medical
Record_, Nov.Stricture of the oesophagus is likewise occasioned by the presence of
papillomatous, fibroid, and other morbid growths.Carcinoma is quite a
frequent cause.The frequent deglutition of undiluted spirituous liquors is said to
give occasion at times to stricture of the oesophagus, but in these
instances this result is usually due to precedent chronic oesophagitis
thereby excited, and terminating in infiltration and hyperplasia of the
submucous connective tissue, and sometimes great thickening of the
epithelium as well.Males are more frequently the subjects of stricture of the oesophagus,
and early adult life the most frequent period for its occurrence,
though it may present at any age.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Except in traumatic cases, the earliest symptoms,
preceded in some instances by indications of mild oesophagitis, perhaps
unnoticed or unrecognized, are occasional impediments to deglutition of
large and firm boluses, or rather a mechanical obstacle to completion
of the act of glutition occurring at intervals of a few meals or a few
days.After a while the swallowing of a large solid bolus becomes
permanently impracticable.Then, sometimes, repeated efforts become
necessary to swallow small masses of solid food; and even to do this
may require external manipulation, or at least the additional pressure
of liquids swallowed immediately after the solid bolus.These efforts
are sometimes attended with spasm, regurgitation, and pain, and may be
accompanied in addition with tracheal dyspnoea, and with nervousness in
consequence.As the disease progresses it becomes impossible to swallow
solid food, and subsequently even fluid food in extreme cases.The
bolus is then often regurgitated immediately after its deglutition, and
may be covered with mucus, blood, pus, or fragments or detritus of
ulcerated malignant growth, according to the nature of the case.Pain
and sensations of rawness are often felt at the point of constriction,
whence the pain often radiates toward one or both scapulae.If the tube
is much dilated above the stricture, the food may be detained in the
sac for several hours, and then be regurgitated in a softened,
partially-decomposed condition.Should the mass be so situated as to
compress the trachea, suffocative symptoms may be produced.In stricture due to organic disease there may be dysphonia from
pressure or injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve producing paralysis
of the vocal band.The anatomical relations of the left recurrent nerve
renders it the much more liable of the two to become implicated.Moderate dyspnoea may result from this paralysis by reason of the
reduced space of the glottis.{424} PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Organic stricture of the
oesophagus is usually due to disease or structural change involving the
mucous membrane and submucous connective tissue; but the muscular
structure may become involved likewise.It may, however, be due to
abnormal laxity of the mucous membrane, permitting a fold to occupy a
position impeding the passage of the bolus.In cases which are not carcinomatous the diminution in the actual
calibre of the tube is usually due to submucous proliferation of
connective tissue and to thickening of the mucous membrane.The
encroachment on the calibre of the tube may be quite slight, or may be
so great as to amount to almost complete occlusion.The seat of stricture is at the upper portion of the oesophagus most
frequently, then at the cardiac extremity, at the point of crossing by
the left bronchus, and at the point of passage through the
diaphragm--all localities slightly constricted normally--but it may
occur at any portion.There may, however, be two,
three, or even four strictures.Multiple strictures are most common
after deglutition of caustic substances which have made their way clear
down into the stomach.Syphilitic strictures are usually single, and so, as a rule, are
strictures of malignant origin.Cicatricial strictures from caustic substances may be in the form of
bands, rings, or longitudinal stripes or folds.Sometimes they are
quite extensive, and have been known to interest fully one-third of the
length of the oesophagus.The circumference, length, calibre, and
thickness of the stricture, however, vary within the most extreme
limits.Occasionally occlusion of the tube is complete.The detention of food above the stricture usually dilates the
oesophagus, producing hypertrophy of the mucous membrane and submucous
connective tissue, followed in its turn by fatty degeneration.Atrophy
of the oesophagus may ensue below the stricture if at all tight, and
the mucous membrane becomes thrown into longitudinal folds.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of organic stricture of the oesophagus rarely
presents difficulty.Dysphagia, spasm, and regurgitation are quite
characteristic of stricture.When the constriction is high up, the
vomiting or regurgitation of food may closely follow its deglutition;
when low down, this act may be delayed ten or fifteen minutes, in some
cases for hours.Alkaline reaction of the vomited matters is indicative
of their having failed to reach the stomach.The presence of
blood-cells, pus-cells, and cancer-cells indicates ulceration,
suppuration, and malignant disease, respectively.Auscultation of the oesophagus during deglutition of water will
indicate the seat of stricture by revealing the ascent of consecutive
air-bubbles even when palpation with bougies fails.The passage of
oesophageal bougies or the stomach-tube into the oesophagus will often
reveal the point of stricture.Its length is estimated by the distance
of the resistance offered to the passage of the instrument; its
diameter, by the size of the largest instrument which can be passed
through it; and its consistence, by the character of the resistance.Care is requisite in manipulating with these instruments, lest by undue
exertion of force they be passed through an ulcerated portion of the
wall of the tube or {425} a diverticulum.The character of the
resistance is sometimes the sole means of differentiating stricture
from stenosis due to compression of the oesophageal wall from its
outside.It sometimes happens, in individuals with impaired sensitiveness of the
epiglottis or vestibule of the larynx, that the exploratory bougie is
introduced into the air-passage instead of the gullet.The usual
premonitory phenomena of suffocation will indicate the mistake.There
is some likelihood, too, of entering the larynx in individuals with
unusually prominent cervical vertebrae and in cases of stricture at the
extreme upper portion of the oesophagus.In introducing these
instruments into the oesophagus, therefore, it is well that they be
guided along the fore finger of the disengaged hand, and passed deeply
into the throat, either to the side of the larynx or behind it.By
keeping to the side and reaching the oesophagus by way of the
laryngo-pharyngeal sinus the risk of entering the larynx may be
avoided.Before introducing the tube the case should be carefully
examined for aneurism, which by pressure sometimes gives rise to the
ordinary subjective symptoms of stricture.Should aneurism be detected,
passage of the tube would be hazardous.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is in most instances unfavorable.It is
comparatively favorable in cases of moderate stricture due to causes
apparently remediable.The extent and volume of the stricture progress
more or less slowly according to the nature of its cause, and in
non-malignant cases, such as are due to the action of caustic
substances, it may last for years before the patient, if not relieved,
succumbs, as he does, from gradual inanition.In the earlier stages,
before the hypertrophied muscles above the stricture undergo fatty
metamorphosis, the increased muscular power is sufficient to force
nourishment through the stricture; but when this becomes no longer
possible progressive marasmus must ensue.Meantime, abscess may become
developed in consequence of the pressure of retained food, and
tuberculous degeneration of the lung and local gangrene may take place
in consequence of the malnutrition.TREATMENT.--The treatment of organic stricture of the oesophagus
resolves itself into maintenance of the general health, the
administration of the iodides to promote absorption of effusions into
the connective tissue or the muscles, mechanical and operative measures
for removal of the causes of the constriction or the strictured tissues
themselves, and operations for securing artificial openings below the
point of stricture for the introduction of nourishment (oesophagostomy
and gastrostomy).Nourishment by enema is of great value.In carcinomatous stricture local measures are in the main
unjustifiable, as they usually entail injury which may prove very
serious.Arsenic internally is thought to <DW44> the progress of
malignant disease when administered early and persistently.Morphine is
used hypodermically to assuage pain.In cancerous and tuberculous disease great caution is requisite in
determining upon mechanical or surgical procedures.In cicatricial
stenosis from the effects of caustic substances, such measures may be
undertaken with much less consideration.The local treatment consists in systematic mechanical dilatation with
bougies or mechanical dilators properly constructed.These are employed
{426} daily, every other day, or at more prolonged intervals, according
to the tolerance of the parts and the progressive improvement.They are
retained several moments at each introduction, and followed by the
passage and immediate withdrawal of an instrument of larger size.It is
often advisable that the final dilatation of each series be made with a
stomach-tube, so that liquid food may be poured through it from a
syphon or a small-lipped vessel, that there may be no necessity for
swallowing food for some hours thereafter.This method is continued
until it becomes evident that nothing further is to be gained by its
continuance.In cases that have been at all successful, the
introduction of the instrument should be repeated every week or two for
a long time, to prevent or <DW44> recurrence of the constriction, which
is very liable to take place.M. Krishaber has reported[21] cases in
which a tube passed through the nose was retained from forty to three
hundred and five days; and from this success he deduces the
practicability of continuous dilatation in this manner.Billroth and
Rokitansky have encountered cases in which frequent dilatation had set
up inflammation of the surrounding connective tissue, which had caused
fatal pleurisy by continuity.Congress_, London, 1881, vol.Forcible dilatation by mechanical separation of the sides of a double
metallic sound has been employed with success in some instances.Destruction of cicatricial tissue by caustics has been attempted, and,
though successes occasionally attend the practice, it is hardly
considered sufficiently promising.Division of the stricture by internal oesophagotomy, with subsequent
dilatation, has been practised of late years, and offers some chances
of success.Oesophagostomy and gastrostomy have been performed in some
cases of impassable stricture, and the latter operation is gaining in
favor.For surgical details, however, we must refer to works on
surgery.Carcinoma of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--Carcinomatous degeneration of the oesophagus, whatever the
variety.SYNONYM.--Cancer of the oesophagus.ETIOLOGY.--Carcinoma is the most frequent disease of the oesophagus
that comes under professional observation.The most frequent variety is
the squamous-celled (53 out of 57, Butlin).Spheroidal-celled and
glandular-celled varieties are much less frequent.In some instances
the morbid product is a combination of the two.Colloid degeneration is
occasionally met with.Its cause is
undetermined, but, as it is most frequent at the constricted portions
of the tube, pressure is supposed to be the exciting cause.It does not
always give rise to secondary infection.Sometimes it is an extension
from the tongue, epiglottis, or larynx, or from the stomach.It is most
frequent in males, and more so in the intemperate than in the
abstinent.The immediate exciting cause is often attributed to local injury from
retention of foreign bodies or the deglutition of hot, acrid, or
indigestible substances.{427} There appears to be some disposition to carcinoma of the
oesophagus in tuberculous subjects (Hamburger), while the children of
tuberculous parents may have carcinoma of the oesophagus, and their
offspring, again, tuberculosis.SYMPTOMS.--The earliest local symptom is slight dysphagia, with
impediment to completion of the act of glutition--an evidence of
commencing stricture.Subsequently, inverted peristaltic action is
added, an evidence of dilatation above the stricture, with partial
retention of food.At a later stage vomiting will occur, with
admixtures of pus and sanguinolent fragments of cancerous tissue.Progressive emaciation and impaired physical endurance usually precede
these local symptoms, but actual cachectic depression may come on quite
tardily.At first there is no pain; subsequently there comes on
considerable uneasiness at some portion of the tube.Finally, there may
be severe local burning or lancinating pains, particularly after meals.If the disease be high up, there may be pain between the shoulders,
along the neck, and even in the head, with radiating pains toward
either shoulder and along the arm.If low down, there may be intense
cardialgia and even cardiac spasm.If the trachea or larynx be
compressed or displaced, dyspnoea will be produced.If the recurrent
laryngeal nerve be compressed, there will be dysphonia or aphonia.Perforation of the larynx will be indicated by cough, expectoration,
hoarseness, or loss of voice; of the trachea, by paroxysmal cough,
dyspnoea, or suffocative spasm; of the lungs, by acute pneumonitis,
especially if food shall have escaped, and expectoration of blood, pus,
and matters swallowed, as may be; of the pleura, by pneumothorax; of
the mediastinum, by emphysema; of the pericardium, by pericarditis; of
the large vessels, by hemorrhage.Perforation of the aorta or pulmonary
artery is often followed by sudden death from hemorrhage, and of the
lungs by rapid death from pneumonitis.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Primitive carcinoma is usually
circumscribed.It is most frequent at the cardiac extremity, but often
occurs where the oesophagus is crossed by the left bronchus, and
sometimes occupies the entire length of the tube.The greater
proclivity of the lower third of the oesophagus has been attributed to
mechanical pressure where it passes through the diaphragm; that of the
middle third, to pressure of its anterior wall against the left
bronchus by the bolus.It begins, either nodulated or diffuse, in the
submucous connective tissue, implicates the mucous membrane, encroaches
upon the calibre of the tube, undergoes softening and ulceration, and
becomes covered with exuberant granulations.When the entire
circumference of the oesophagus is involved stricture results,
sometimes amounting eventually to complete obstruction.Ulceration
taking place, the calibre again becomes permeable.The oesophagus
becomes dilated above the constriction and collapsed below it.As the disease progresses the adjoining tissues become involved.Adhesions may take place with trachea, bronchi, bronchial glands,
lungs, diaphragm, or even the spinal column (Newman[22]).Perforation
may take place into the trachea, usually just above the bifurcation, or
into the lungs, pleura, mediastinum, pericardium, aorta, or pulmonary
artery.Abscesses are formed, the contents of which undergo
putrefaction.There {428} may be involvement of the pneumogastric
nerve, with reflex influence on the spinal nerves and the sympathetic
(Gurmay[23]).Journ._, Aug., 1879, p.de l'Aisne_, 1869; _Gaz.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis will rest on due appreciation of the symptoms
enumerated and the ultimate evidence of the cancerous cachexia.Auscultation will often reveal the location of the disease.This may be
further confirmed by palpation with the bougie, but the manipulation
should be made without using any appreciable force.Laryngoscopic
inspection and digital exploration are sufficient when the entrance
into the oesophagus is involved.Differential diagnosis is difficult at an early stage, and often to be
based solely on negative phenomena.At a later stage it is easy,
especially when cancerous fragments are expelled.In some instances a
tumor can be felt externally.Such a tumor, however, has been known to
have been the head of the pancreas (Reid[24]).Journ._, Oct., 1877, p.Cancer of the oesophagus is liable to be confounded with chronic
oesophagitis, cicatricial stenosis, diverticulum, extraneous
compression, abscess, and non-malignant morbid growths.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is unfavorable, the disease incurable.Death
may be expected in from one to two years, though sometimes delayed for
longer periods.Inanition or marasmus is the usual cause of death in
uncomplicated cases.Sometimes it takes place by haematemesis,
sometimes following involvement of the stomach, and sometimes wholly
unassociated with any direct disease of the walls of the stomach.Death
takes place not infrequently from perforation into adjoining organs,
and sometimes from secondary inflammation of other vital organs, as the
brain and the lungs.TREATMENT.--There is little to be done in the way of treatment apart
from the constitutional measures indicated in carcinoma generally and
in chronic diseases of the oesophagus.The cautious use of the
stomach-tube to convey nourishment into the stomach is allowable during
the earlier stages of the disease only.It is dangerous after
ulceration has taken place, from the risk of perforating the walls of
the oesophagus, and thus hurrying on the fatal issue by injury to the
intrathoracic tissues.When deglutition becomes impracticable or the passage of the oesophagus
absolutely impermeable to nutriment, food and alcoholic stimuli should
be administered by enema.Indeed, it is good practice to begin to give
nourishment occasionally by the bowel before it becomes absolutely
necessary, so as to accustom the part and the patient to the
manipulation.Narcotics to relieve pain are best administered
hypodermatically, so as to avoid unnecessary irritation of the rectum.The passage of dilators, as in stricture of cicatricial origin, is very
hazardous.They produce irritation, which hastens the softening of the
tissues, and are open to the risk of penetrating the softened tissues
and passing through the walls of the oesophagus into the pleura, lung,
or mediastinum.Fatal accidents of this nature are on record.Gastrostomy is sometimes performed to prolong life.{429} Paralysis of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--Loss of motive-force in the muscular tissue of the
oesophagus, whether intrinsic or reflex in origin.SYNONYMS.--Gulae imbecillitas, Paralytic dysphagia, Atonic dysphagia.ETIOLOGY.--Paralysis of the oesophagus may be caused by impairment of
function in one or more of the nervous tracts distributed to the
muscles concerned in dilating the upper orifice of the gullet or in
those concerned in the peristaltic movements which propel the bolus to
the stomach.These impairments of function may be nutritive in origin,
as in softening and atrophy of the nerve-trunk, or, as is more
frequent, they may be pressure-phenomena from extravasations of blood,
purulent accumulations, exostoses, tumors, and the like.The paralysis may be due to disease or wounds of the nerves themselves
or of their motor roots, or of the cerebro-spinal axis, implicating
their origin, or to pressure and atrophy of a trunk-nerve in some
portion of its tract.It is likewise due to neurasthenia from
hemorrhage or from protracted disease (enteric fever, yellow fever,
cholera), or to systemic poisoning in diphtheria, syphilis, and
plumbism.It may be due to muscular atrophy or intermuscular
proliferations of connective tissue, to dilatation of the oesophagus,
and to disease in the tube.It may be due to mechanical restraint from
external adhesions of the oesophagus to intrathoracic tumors
(Finny[25]).It may follow
the sudden reaction of cold upon the overheated body.It is one of the
manifestations of hysteria and of the hysteria of pregnancy.SYMPTOMS.--Partial paralysis may give rise to no symptoms at all.The
earliest manifestations are those of impediment to the prompt passage
of the bolus to the stomach, repeated acts of deglutition or additional
swallows of food or drink being necessary.Large masses are swallowed
and propelled onward more readily than small ones, and solids more
readily than fluids.There is often a characteristic gurgling attending
the passage of fluids along the tube.Swallowing is best performed in
the erect posture.These symptoms increase in severity as the paralysis
increases.In some cases there is
no regurgitation of food; in others, this is more or less frequent.When the paralysis is complete, deglutition becomes impossible, and the
food attempted to be swallowed is expelled from the mouth and nose in a
paroxysm of cough.Sometimes the food enters the larynx and produces
paroxysms of suffocation or threatens asphyxia.There is more or less flow of saliva from the mouth in consequence of
the inability to swallow it; and in some cases the losses of material
from the blood are so great as to reduce the patient very rapidly.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Paralysis of the oesophagus may be
partial or complete.It may be associated with paralysis of the
pharynx, palate, tongue, epiglottis, or larynx; with so-called bulbar
paralysis; with general paralysis; with cerebro-spinal disseminated
sclerosis.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis rests mainly on the symptoms of dysphagia,
especially when associated with paralyses elsewhere.It is
differentiated {430} from paralysis of the pharynx by the ability to
swallow the bolus and the apparent arrest of the bolus at some portion
of the tube.Auscultation of the oesophagus will determine the locality
of the arrest.It likewise affords presumptive evidence of an
alteration in the usual form of the bolus, which, being subjected to
compression at its upper portion only, assumes the form of an inverted
cone.The remaining auscultatory indications are similar to those of
dilatation.There is no impediment to the passage of the stomach-tube or
oesophageal sound, or to its free manipulation when within the
oesophagus.When the symptoms quickly reach a maximum, they indicate a paralysis
due to apoplexy, and so they do when the symptoms are sudden, hysteria
being eliminated.Paralysis due to gumma or other cerebral tumor is
much slower in its course.PROGNOSIS.--In idiopathic paralysis, the local or special affection to
which it is due being curable, the prognosis is favorable, especially
if the paralysis be confined to the oesophagus.Recovery, however, is
often slow, even in curable cases.In hysterical paralysis the
prognosis is good.In deuteropathic paralysis the prognosis is much
less favorable, and will depend upon the nature of the causal
disease--apoplexy, insanity, cerebral tumor, syphilis, etc.TREATMENT.--The treatment varies with the nature of the cause as far as
combating the origin of the disease is concerned.With regard to the
intrinsic paralysis of the oesophagus itself, strychnine and its
congeners are indicated, and may be administered hypodermatically if
the difficulty in swallowing be very great.If the paralysis be
partial, it is better to give nux vomica or Ignatia amara by the mouth,
in hopes of getting some beneficial astringent influence on the walls
of the oesophagus.In all instances the feeding of the patient is an important element in
treatment.Masses of food arrested in the tube should be forced onward
with the sound.In some cases nourishment must be habitually introduced
through the stomach-tube and nutritive enemata be resorted to.Electricity, though sometimes successful, is a risky agent to employ,
because, as announced by Duchenne, the use of an oesophageal electrode
is attended with some risk of unduly exciting the pneumogastric nerve
and thereby inducing syncope.Dilatation of the Oesophagus.DEFINITION.--An abnormal distension of a portion of the oesophagus or
of the entire tube, whether general, annular, or pouched.SYNONYMS.--Oesophagocele, Hernia of the oesophagus, Diverticulum of the
oesophagus.ETIOLOGY.--Dilatation of the oesophagus is occasionally met as a
congenital affection (Hanney,[26] Grisolle,[27] and others).Usually, however, dilatation of
the oesophagus is of mechanical origin, due to distension by food or
water above a stricture or an impacted foreign body.Presumptive
paralysis of the muscular coat in chronic oesophagitis is alleged as a
source of similar distension.int._, Paris, 1883, ii.{431} General dilatation is presumed to be the mechanical result of
constriction of the cardiac extremity, leading to distension of the
oesophagus by the accumulation of large quantities of liquids.Sometimes it is due to paralysis of the muscular coat, permitting its
distension by food.Annular dilatation is sometimes due to distension just above the seat
of a stricture.Sometimes it is due to impaction of a foreign body;
sometimes there is no mechanical impediment; occasionally it is
observed as a congenital anomaly.Pouched dilatation (diverticulum) is usually due to retention of food
immediately above an impacted foreign body or some obstruction of
another character.Some of the muscular fibres of the oesophageal wall
become separated and spread asunder, allowing the mucous membrane to be
gradually forced through them by repeated efforts of deglutition upon
retained masses of food or drink, until finally a pouch is formed,
hernia-like, outside of the tube.Another mode of production is said
(Rokitansky[28]) to consist in the subsidence of tumefied glands
outside the oesophagus, after adhesions had been contracted with the
oesophagus during the inflammatory process.The shrinking of these
enlarged glands to their normal volume sometimes draws the tube outward
into a funnel-shaped sac constricted at its margin by the muscular
coat, which has receded from the pouch or has been stripped loose.The
same form of dilatation is likewise an occasional result of rupture of
the muscular coat sustained in blows or falls.It occasionally exists,
too, as a congenital defect, and this has been attributed (Bardeleben
and Billroth[29]) to partial closing of one of the branchial fissures
externally, while the internal opening has remained patent.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The symptoms, at first, are usually those of
obstruction to the passage of food, but before this obstruction occurs
dilatation may have existed without symptoms.In some cases of
diverticulum high up, there is a tumor, usually on the left side of the
neck.Rokitansky has reported one the size of the fist situated on the
right side of the neck, and Hankel[30] and others a tumor upon each
side.The tumor varies in bulk from time to time according as it may be
empty or may be distended with food, drink, or gas.[Footnote 30: _Rust's Mag._, 1833; _Dict.cit._]

Food caught in the pouch can often be forced out into the pharynx by
external pressure over the tumor in the neck.The retention of food
above a constriction or in a sac is usually accompanied by some
distress after indulgence in too much food.This uneasiness becomes
relieved upon regurgitation or vomiting.Deglutition is impeded to a
less extent when the disease does not implicate the upper portion of
the gut.Complete dilatation is sometimes indicated by long addiction to habits
of rumination.In some instances this rumination is an agreeable
sensuous process.In pouched dilatation it is very often disagreeable,
the regurgitated matters being acrid, owing to acid fermentation of the
contents of the sac.While the dilatation remains moderate there may be little dysphagia or
none at all, the muscles continuing sufficiently vigorous to propel the
food; but after the muscles become paralyzed by distension the
dysphagia gradually increases and may culminate in complete aphagia.One {432} of the special indications of diverticulum is that the
regurgitation does not take place until several hours after a meal.As
the sac enlarges there may be less and less complaint of dysphagia,
because it becomes able to contain larger quantities of food.At the
same time it may so compress the main tube as to occlude its calibre
and prevent access of food to the stomach.The symptoms of annular dilatation are similar to those of stricture
with retention of food above it, the regurgitation usually following
deglutition more quickly.In some cases of dilatation, circumscribed and general, food is
sometimes retained for an entire day or more before it is ejected.The
decomposition of the retained food usually produces a more or less
continuous foul odor from the mouth.The course of the affection is progressively from bad to worse, and
entails ultimate emaciation.Some patients succumb early, and some live
to advanced age.Perforation of the oesophagus ensues in some
instances, and death results in consequence of the injuries sustained
by perioesophageal structures by the escape of the contents of the
oesophagus.Perforation is indicated by sudden collapse and by
emphysema from swallowed air.PATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY.--Dilatation of the oesophagus is either
general or partial, according as it takes place in the whole or greater
portion of the oesophagus or in a circumscribed portion.Partial
dilatation may involve the entire circumference of the canal (annular
dilatation), or it may implicate but a portion of the wall, which
becomes pouched into a sac externally (diverticulum or saccular
dilatation).General dilatation, though sometimes congenital, is, as mentioned under
Etiology, more frequently the mechanical result of distension of the
oesophagus by food or drink prevented from ready entrance into the
stomach by a constriction at the cardiac orifice.This form of
dilatation is sometimes discovered as a post-mortem curiosity.The
muscles have usually undergone great hypertrophy, and the mucous
membrane some thickening and congestion, with erosions and sometimes
ulcerations, indicative of chronic oesophagitis.In some instances all
the coats of the oesophagus have undergone hypertrophy.The dilatation
may vary from slight enlargement to the thickness of an ordinary man's
arm or larger (Rokitansky[31]); in rare cases, even a capacity nearly
equal to that of the stomach (Luschka[32] and others).Anat._]

[Footnote 32: _Arch.fur Anat., etc._, March, 1868, p.Fusiform Dilatation of Oesophagus (Luschka).A,
Larynx; B, Thyroid gland; C, Trachea; D, Oesophagus; E, Stomach.]The oesophagus is usually fusiform or spindle-shaped, being constricted
at those portions at which it is normally slightly constricted.Sometimes the dilatation takes place between the lobes of the lungs
(Raymond[33]).Annular dilatation is usually due to circumferential distension just
above a stricture.When not due to stricture its seat is usually just
above the diaphragm, where the oesophagus is normally liable to
constriction.The upper portion of the dilatation is larger than the
lower portion, and the muscular walls are usually hypertrophied.Pouched dilatation (diverticulum) is usually formed chiefly of mucous
membrane and submucous tissue pushed through gaps in the fibres of the
{433} muscular coat, produced by distension.It sometimes involves the
entire coat in cases in which the oesophageal wall has become adherent
to enlarged lymphatic glands, which subsequently undergo subsidence in
volume and drag the adherent portion of the wall after them
(Rokitansky).The muscular walls are then usually hypertrophied, the
mucous membrane sometimes hypertrophied, sometimes atrophied.The
diverticulum is usually located in the upper portion of the oesophagus,
just below the inferior constrictor muscle of the pharynx.It may thus
be, in part, a pharyngocele also.It may be located behind the point of
bifurcation of the trachea or where the oesophagus is crossed by the
left bronchus.Its direction may be to the left side in the upper
portion of the oesophagus, to the right side, or upon both sides; but
when situated lower down it is usually directed backward, between the
posterior wall of the tube and the spinal column.Hence its distension
with food completely blocks up the calibre of the oesophagus.The
orifice by which the oesophageal wall remains in communication with the
pouch is round or elliptic in shape and variable in size, sometimes
being about an inch in its long diameter, sometimes much smaller.The
size of the diverticulum varies; a common size is that of a duck egg,
but the size of a fist has been attained.Sometimes the diverticulum
drags the oesophagus out of position and forms a sort of blind pouch in
the direct line of its axis, so that it becomes filled with food which
fails to reach the stomach.The dilatations become enlarged by retention of food, and are liable to
undergo inflammation, ulceration, and perforation.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis will depend upon the symptoms of dysphagia,
regurgitation, and so on, and upon the evidence furnished by
auscultatory indications, palpation with the oesophageal sound, and, in
some instances, the existence of a tumor in the neck, enlarging after
meals, and {434} from which food or mucus can be forced up into the
pharynx by pressure externally.Stethoscopic auscultation of the oesophagus during the deglutition of
water indicates an alteration in the usual form of the gulp, which
seems to trickle rapidly in a larger or smaller stream according to the
degree of dilatation.If the dilatation be annular and located high up,
auscultation is said to give the impression of a general sprinkling of
fluid deflected from its course.The peculiar gurgle is often audible
without the aid of stethoscopy.Palpation with the oesophageal bougie
is competent to reveal the existence of a large sac by the facility
with which the terminal extremity of the sound can be moved in the
cavity.In the case of a diverticulum, however, the sound may glide
past the mouth of the pouch without entering it, although arrested at
the bottom of the sac in most instances.In annular dilatation any constriction below it is usually perceptible
to the touch through the sound; but, on the other hand, the ready
passage of the bougie into the stomach, while excluding stricture, does
not positively disprove the existence of a circumscribed dilatation.If
high up, the dilatation may be detected externally by its enlargement
when filled with food after a meal, and the subsidence of tumefaction
when the sac is emptied by pressure from without, or by regurgitation.If the dilatation occupy a position which exercises compression of the
trachea, dyspnoea will ensue when it is distended.The intermittence of
the tumefaction serves to differentiate the swelling from abscess or
morbid growth.From aneurism of the aorta, which it may simulate
(Davy[34]), it is to be discriminated by absence of the usual
stethoscopic and circulatory manifestations.The diagnosis of
congenital dilatation is based upon a history of difficulty in
deglutition dating from the earliest period of recollection.Press and
Circular_, May, 1874.]PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is not favorable in any given case unless the
cause can be removed, and not even then unless food can be prevented
from accumulating in the distended portion of the tube.Nevertheless,
cases sometimes go on into advanced age.On the other hand, they may
terminate fatally within a year (Lindau[35]).The danger of perforation
adds additional gravity to the prognosis, for life may be suddenly lost
by this accident.A case of
death by suffocation has been recorded, attributed to the pressure of
the distended oesophagus upon the intrathoracic vessels (Hannay[36]).[Footnote 35: _Casper's Wochenschrift_, 1840, No.de
Med._, 1841, p.de Med et de Chir._, xxiv.Journ._, July 1, 1833.]TREATMENT.--If the dilatation be due to stricture or to an impacted
foreign body, the treatment should be directed to overcoming the one
and removing the other.General dilatation from chronic oesophagitis requires treatment for
that disease.Much depends upon preventing the accumulation of food in a sac or
diverticle; the best means of accomplishing which is the systematic
administration of all nutriment by means of the stomach-tube.When this
is not advisable, care must be exercised in the selection of such food
as is least likely to irritate the parts if detained in the pouch.{435} As far as general treatment is concerned, stimulants are usually
indicated, as the patients become much reduced.If paralysis of the
muscular coat of the oesophagus is believed to exist, the
administration of preparations of phosphorus and of strychnine are
indicated on general principles of therapeutics.Stimulation of
muscular contractility by the oesophageal electrode has been
recommended, but the prospects of success hardly justify the risks of
serious injury in the domain of the pneumogastric nerve.It has not yet been determined whether surgical procedures are
competent to relieve dilatation.In cases of pouched dilatation high up
it would not be difficult, as suggested by Michel,[37] to expose the
sac and excise it in such a manner that the sutures uniting the walls
of the oesophagus shall occupy the site of the mouth of the
diverticulum, and, thus obliterating it by cicatrization, restore the
normal path of the food from the pharynx to the oesophagus.Gastrostomy, too, should hold out some hope of rescue, no matter what
portion of the oesophagus be dilated.{436}

FUNCTIONAL AND INFLAMMATORY DISEASES OF THE STOMACH.BY SAMUEL G. ARMOR, M.D., LL.D.Functional Dyspepsia (Atonic Dyspepsia, Indigestion).To difficulty in the physiological process of digestion the familiar
name of dyspepsia has been given, while to a merely disturbed condition
of the function the term indigestion is more frequently applied.This
distinction, difficult at all times to make, may appear more arbitrary
than real; and inasmuch as it involves no important practical point,
the author of the present article will use the terms interchangeably as
indicating functional disturbance of the stomach--_i.e._ disturbance of
the digestive process not associated with changes of an inflammatory
character, so far as we know.Since it is one of the most common of all complaints from its
association with various other morbid conditions, the term is not
unfrequently vaguely employed.It is difficult, of course, to define a
disease whose etiology is so directly related to so many distinct
morbid conditions.Indeed, there are few diseases, general or local,
which are not at some time in their history associated with more or
less derangement of the digestive process.For purposes of limitation,
therefore, it will be understood that we now refer to chronic
functional forms of indigestion which depend largely, at least, on a
purely nervous element, and for this reason are not infrequently
described as sympathetic dyspepsia.Doubt has been expressed as to
whether such forms of disease ever exist, but that we encounter purely
functional forms of dyspepsia, corresponding to the dyspepsia apyretica
of Broussais, would appear to be a well-recognized clinical fact.What the precise relation is between digestive disturbances and the
nervous system we may not fully understand, no more than we understand
how a healthy condition of nervous endowment is essential to all vital
processes.Even lesions of nutrition are now known to depend upon
primary disturbance of nervous influence.This is seen in certain skin
diseases, such as herpes zoster, which closely follows the destruction
of certain nerves.And it is well known that injury of nerve-trunks is
not unfrequently followed by impaired nutrition and failure in
reparative power in the parts to which such nerves are distributed.Indeed, so marked is the influence of the nervous system over the
nutritive operations that the question has been considered as to
whether there are {437} trophic nerves distributed to tissue-elements
themselves whose special function is to keep these elements in a
healthy state of nutrition.The proof, at least, that the digestive
process is, in some unexplained way, under the immediate influence of
the nervous system, either cerebro-spinal or trophic, is both varied
and abundant.The digestive secretions are known to be the products of
living cells which are abundantly supplied with nerve-fibres, and we
can readily believe that the potential energy of this cell-force is
probably vital and trophic.At any rate, it is unknown in the domain of
ordinary chemistry.The digestive ferments, as clearly pointed out by
Roberts, are the direct products of living cells.Their mode of action,
he claims, bears no resemblance to that of ordinary chemical affinity.Nor do they derive their
vital endowments from material substances."They give nothing material
to, and take nothing from, the substances acted on.The albuminoid
matter which constitutes their mass is evidently no more than the
material substance of a special kind of energy--just as the steel of a
magnet is the material substratum of the magnetic energy, but is not
itself that energy" (Roberts).That this living cell-force is partly,
at least, derived from the nervous system is clear from the well-known
effects of mental emotion, such as acute grief, despair, etc., in
putting an immediate stop to the digestive process.Experiments on the
lower animals have also shown the direct influence of the nervous
system over gastric secretion.Wilson Philip showed by various
experiments on rabbits and other animals that if the eighth pair of
nerves be divided in the neck, any food which the creatures may
afterward eat remains in the stomach undigested, and after death, when
the nerve has been divided, the coats of the stomach are not found
digested, however long the animal may have been dead.Bernard also
excited a copious secretion by galvanization of the pneumogastric, and
by section of the same nerve stopped the process of digestion and
produced "pallor and flaccidity of the stomach."Recently doubt has
been thrown on these statements of Bernard and Frerichs.Goltz
concludes, from observations made on frogs, that nerve-ganglia,
connected by numerous intercommunicating bundles of nerve-fibres, exist
in the walls of the stomach, the irritation of which gives rise to
local contractions and peristaltic movements of the stomach, and that
these ganglia influence the gastric secretion.However this may be, it
still remains true that these gastric ganglia are in connection,
through the vagi, with the medulla oblongata, and are thus influenced
by the cerebro-spinal nerve-centres.And clinical observation confirms
what theoretical considerations would suggest.Thus, strong mental
impressions are known to produce sudden arrest of secretion, and that
which arrests secretion may, if continued, lead to perversion of the
same.Impressions made upon the nerves of special sense are also known to
affect the salivary and gastric secretions.The flow of saliva is
stimulated by the sight, the smell, the taste, and even thought, of
food.Bidder and Schmidt made interesting experiments on dogs bearing
upon this point.They ascertained by placing meat before dogs that had
been kept fasting that gastric juice was copiously effused into the
stomach.Other secretions are known to be similarly affected.Carpenter
by a series of well-observed cases has shown the direct influence of
mental conditions on the {438} mammary secretion.The nervous
association of diabetes and chronic Bright's disease is interesting in
this connection, and the direct nervous connection betwixt the brain
and the liver has been shown by numerous experiments.It is maintained
by modern physiologists that "the liver--indeed each of the
viscera--has its representative area in the brain, just as much as the
arm or leg is represented in a distant localized area" (Hughlings
Jackson).And in harmony with this view Carpenter long since pointed
out the fact that if the volitional direction of the consciousness to a
part be automatically kept up for a length of time, both the functional
action and the nutrition of the part may suffer.It has been described
by him as expectant attention, and it has, as we shall see, important
practical bearings on the management of gastric affections.Sympathetic
disturbance of the stomach is also connected with direct disease of the
brain.The almost immediate
effects of a blow are nausea and vomiting, and the same thing is
observed in local inflammation of the meninges of the brain.Many forms of functional dyspepsia due to nervous disturbance of a
reflex character will be pointed out when discussing the etiology of
the disease.ETIOLOGY.--Among the agencies affecting the digestive process in atonic
forms of dyspepsia may be mentioned--

First, predisposing causes;

Second, exciting causes.In general terms it may be said that all conditions of depressed
vitality predispose to the varied forms of atonic dyspepsia.These
conditions range through an endless combination of causes, both
predisposing and exciting.There is not a disturbed condition of life,
extrinsic or intrinsic, that may not contribute to this end.In some
cases it may be the effects of hot and enervating climates; in others
the alterations in the elementary constituents of the blood may be
apparent; while in still others the cause may be exhausting discharges,
hemorrhages, profuse suppuration, venereal excesses, sedentary
occupations, and long-continued mental and moral emotions.Heredity may also predispose to functional dyspepsia.Certain faulty
states of the nervous system are specially liable to be transmitted
from parent to offspring--not always in the exact form in which they
appeared in the parent, but in forms determined by the individual life
of the offspring.For obvious reasons, growing out of our modern
American civilization, the inheritance of a faulty nervous organization
is apt to spend itself upon the digestive apparatus.The inordinate
mental activity, the active competitions of life, the struggle for
existence, the haste to get rich, the disappointments of failure,--all
contribute to this end.The general tendency of American life is also
in the direction of a highly-developed and morbidly sensitive nervous
system, and functional dyspepsia is a natural sequence of this.The
symptoms of dyspepsia thus caused usually manifest themselves at an
early period of life.The stomach becomes weak as age
advances, in common with all the functions of the body, and consequent
upon this weakness there is diminished excitability of the gastric
nerves, with diminished muscular action of the walls of the stomach and
deficient secretion of the gastric juice.Chronic structural changes
are {439} also apt to occur in advanced life.The gastric glands become
atrophied and the arteries become atheromatous, so that with symptoms
of indigestion there are often associated loss of consciousness at
times, vertigo, irregular action of the heart, etc.These general facts
have an important bearing upon the hygienic management of dyspepsia in
the aged.They require, as a rule, less food than the young and
vigorous.In times when famine was more frequent than now it was found
that the older a human being was, the better deficiency of food was
borne.Hippocrates tells us, in his _Aphorisms_, that old men suffer
least from abstinence.Their food should be such, both in quantity and
quality, as the enfeebled stomach can digest.There is less demand for
the materials of growth, and consequently for animal food.Moderate
quantities of alcohol, judiciously used, are also specially adapted to
the indigestion of the aged.It has the double effect of stimulating
the digestive process and at the same time checking the activity of
destructive assimilation, which in old age exhausts the vital force.And in order to more effectively arrest destructive metamorphosis great
caution should be taken against excessive muscular fatigue, as well as
against sudden extremes of temperature.Loss of appetite from deficient
formation of gastric juice is a common symptom in old age.This is not
often successfully treated by drugs, and yet medicines are not without
value.The sesquicarbonate of ammonium acts as a stimulant to the
mucous membrane and to the vaso-motor nerve, and in this way becomes a
valuable addition to the simple vegetable bitters.Dilute hydrochloric
acid with the vegetable bitters may also be tried.Condiments with the
food directly stimulate the action of the enfeebled stomach.The old
remedy of mustard-seed is not unfrequently useful, and pepper, cayenne,
horseradish, and curries act in a similar manner in torpid digestion.And in cases of great exhaustion associated with anaemia benefit may be
derived from small doses of iron added to tincture of columbo or
gentian.Nor should it be forgotten that in the opposite extreme of life the
digestive capacity is extremely limited.The infant's digestion is
readily disturbed by unsuitable alimentation.For obvious reasons it
does not easily digest starchy substances.The diastasic ferment does
not exist in the saliva of young sucking animals, at least to any
extent.No food is so suitable for early infantile life as the mother's
milk, provided the mother herself is healthy.It contains in an easily
digestible form all the constituents necessary to the rapidly-growing
young animal.Van Helmont's substitute of bread boiled in beer and
honey for milk, or Baron Liebig's food for infants, cannot take the
place of nature's type of food, which we find in milk.If a substitute
has to be selected, there is nothing so good as cow's milk diluted with
an equal quantity of soft water, or, what in many cases is better,
barley-water, to which may be added a teaspoonful of powdered sugar of
milk and a pinch of table-salt and phosphate of lime.Lime-water may be
added with advantage.Dilution of alimentary substances is an important
condition of absorption in the infant stomach.Anaemia is a common predisposing cause of indigestion.Indeed, as a
widely-prevailing pathological condition few causes stand out so
prominent.It affects at once the great nutritive processes, and these
in turn disturb the functional activity of all the organs of the body.Not only are the gastric and intestinal glands diminished in their
{440} functional activity by impoverished or altered blood, but the
movements of the stomach are retarded by weakened muscular action.It
is impossible to separate altered blood from perverted tissue-structure
and altered secretion.Indigestion produced by anaemia is difficult of
treatment, on account of the complexity of the pathological conditions
usually present, the anaemia itself being generally a secondary
condition.Careful inquiry should be made, therefore, into the probable
cause of the anaemia, and this should, if possible, be removed as an
important part of the treatment of the dyspepsia.Nothing will more
promptly restore the digestive capacity in such cases than good,
healthy, well-oxidized blood.Indeed, healthy blood is a condition
precedent to the normal functional activity of the stomach.To these general predisposing causes may be added indigestion occurring
in febrile states of the system.In all
general febrile conditions the secretions are markedly disturbed; the
tongue is dry and furred; the urine is scanty; the excretions lessened;
the bowels constipated; and the appetite gone.The nervous system also
participates in the general disturbance.In this condition the gastric
juice is changed both quantitatively and qualitatively, and digestion,
as a consequence, becomes weak and imperfect--a fact that should be
taken into account in regulating the diet of febrile patients.From
mere theoretical considerations there can be no doubt that fever
patients are often overfed.To counteract the relatively increased
tissue-metamorphosis known to exist, and the consequent excessive
waste, forced nutrition is frequently resorted to.Then the traditional
saying of the justly-celebrated Graves, that he fed fevers, has also
rendered popular the practice.Within certain bounds alimentation is
undoubtedly an important part of the treatment of all the essential
forms of fever.But if more food is crowded upon the stomach than can
be digested and assimilated, it merely imposes a burden instead of
supplying a want.The excess of food beyond the digestive capacity
decomposes, giving rise to fetid gases, and often to troublesome
intestinal complications.The true mode of restoring strength in such
cases is to administer only such quantities of food as the patient is
capable of digesting and assimilating.To this end resort has been had
to food in a partially predigested state, such as peptonized milk, milk
gruel, soups, jellies, and beef-tea; and clinical experience has thus
far shown encouraging results from such nutrition in the management of
general fevers.In these febrile conditions, and in all cases of
general debility, the weak digestion does not necessarily involve
positive disease of the stomach, for by regulating the diet according
to the digestive capacity healthy digestion may be obtained for an
indefinite time.Exhaustion of the nerves of organic life strongly predisposes to the
atonic forms of dyspepsia.We have already seen how markedly the
digestive process is influenced by certain mental states, and it is a
well-recognized fact that the sympathetic system of nerves is
intimately associated with all the vegetative functions of the body.Without a certain amount of nervous energy derived from this portion of
the nervous system, there is failure of the two most important
conditions of digestion--viz.muscular movements of the stomach and
healthy secretion of gastric juice.This form of indigestion is
peculiar to {441} the ill-fed and badly-nourished.It follows in the
wake of privation and want, and is often seen in the peculiarly
careworn and sallow classes who throng our public dispensaries.In this
dyspepsia of exhaustion the solvent power of the stomach is so
diminished that if food is forced upon the patient it is apt to be
followed by flatulence, headache, uneasy or painful sensations in the
stomach, and sometimes by nausea and diarrhoea.It is best treated by
improving in every possible way the general system of nutrition, and by
adapting the food, both in quantity and quality, to the enfeebled
condition of the digestive powers.Hygienic measures are also of great
importance in the management of this form of dyspepsia, and especially
such as restore the lost energy of the nervous system.If it occur in
badly-nourished persons who take little outdoor exercise, the food
should be adapted to the feeble digestive power.It should consist for
a time largely of milk and eggs, oatmeal, peptonized milk gruels, stale
bread; to which should be added digestible nitrogenous meat diet in
proportion to increased muscular exercise.Systematic outdoor exercise
should be insisted upon as a sine qua non.Much benefit may be derived
from the employment of electric currents, and hydrotherapy has also
given excellent results.If the indigestion occur in the badly-fed
outdoor day-laborer, his food should be more generous and mixed.It
should consist largely, however, of digestible nitrogenous food, and
meat, par excellence, should be increased in proportion to the exercise
taken.Medicinally, such cases should be treated on general principles.Benefit may be derived from the mineral acids added to simple bitters,
or in cases of extreme nervous prostration small doses of nux vomica
are a valuable addition to dilute hydrochloric acid.The not unfrequent
resort to phosphorus in such cases is of more than doubtful utility.Some interesting contributions have been recently made to this subject
of gastric neuroses by Buchard, See, and Mathieu.Buchard claims that
atonic dilatation of the stomach is a very frequent result of an
adynamic state of the general system.He compares it to certain forms
of cardiac dilatation--both expressions of myasthenia.It may result
from profound anaemia or from psychical causes.Mathieu regards mental
depression as only second in frequency.Much stress is laid upon
poisons generated by fermenting food in the stomach in such cases.It
may cause a true toxaemia, just as renal diseases give rise to uraemia.Of course treatment in such cases must be addressed principally to the
general constitution.But of all predisposing causes of dyspepsia, deficient gastric
secretion, with resulting fermentation of food, is perhaps the most
prevalent.It is true this deficient secretion may be, and often is, a
secondary condition; many causes contribute to its production; but
still, the practical fact remains that the immediate cause of the
indigestion is disproportion between the quantity of gastric juice
secreted and the amount of food taken into the stomach.In all such
cases we have what is popularly known as torpidity of digestion, and
the condition described is that of atony of the stomach.The two main
constituents of gastric juice--namely, acid and pepsin--may be
deficient in quantity or disturbed in their relative proportions.A
certain amount of acid is absolutely essential to the digestive
process, while a small amount of pepsin may be sufficient to digest a
large amount of albuminoid food.{442} Pure unmixed gastric juice was
first analyzed by Bidder and Schmidt.The mean analyses of ten
specimens free from saliva, procured from dogs, gave the following
results:

  _Gastric Juice of a Dog_.Water                        973.06
  Solids                        26.94
    Containing--Peptone and pepsin   17.19
    Free hydrochloric acid            3.05
    Alkaline chlorides                4.26
    Ammonium chloride                 0.47
    Chlorine                          5.06
               | Lime                 1.73
    Phosphates | Magnesia             0.23
               | Iron                 0.08

They proved by the most careful analyses that fresh gastric juice
contains only one mineral acid--namely, hydrochloric; since which time
Richet has been able to prove that "this acid does not exist in a free
state, but in loose combination with an organic substance known as
lucin," the chloride of lucin.And just here the curious and puzzling
question arises as to the secretion of a mineral acid from alkaline
blood.Ewald, the distinguished lecturer in the Royal University of
Berlin, tells us that "a brilliant experiment of Maly's has thrown
unexpected light upon this.There are fluids of alkaline reaction which
may contain two acid and alkaline mutually inoffensive salts, but still
have an alkaline reaction, because the acid reaction is to a certain
extent eclipsed; for instance, a solution of neutral phosphate of soda
(Na_{2}HPO_{4}) and acid phosphate of soda (NaH_{2}PO_{4}) is alkaline.Such a solution placed in a dialyzer after a short time gives up its
acid salt to the surrounding distilled water, and one has in the
dialyzer an alkaline fluid outside an acid fluid."He thus proved that
the acid phosphate of sodium is present in the blood in spite of its
alkaline reaction.Lack of the normal amount of the gastric secretion must be met by
restoring the physiological conditions upon which the secretion
depends.In the mean time, hydrochloric and lactic acids may be tried
for the purpose of strengthening the solvent powers of the gastric
secretion.EXCITING CAUSES.--The immediate causes of dyspepsia are such as act
more directly on the stomach.They embrace all causes which produce
conditions of gastric catarrh, such as excess in eating and drinking,
imperfect mastication and insalivation, the use of indigestible or
unwholesome food and of alcohol, the imperfect arrangement of meals,
over-drugging, etc.Of exciting causes, errors of diet are amongst the most constantly
operative, and of these errors excess of food is doubtless the most
common.The influence of this as an etiological factor in derangement
of digestion can scarcely be exaggerated.In very many instances more
food is taken into the stomach than is actually required to restore
tissue-waste, and the effects of such excess upon the organism are as
numerous as they are hurtful.Indeed, few elements of disease are more
constantly operative in a great variety of ailments.In the first
place, if food be introduced into the stomach beyond
tissue-requirements, symptoms of indigestion at once manifest
themselves.The natural balance betwixt {443} supply and demand is
disturbed; the general nutrition of the body is interfered with; local
disturbances of nutrition follow; and mal-products of digestion find
their way into the blood.Especially is this the case when the
excessive amount of food contains a disproportionate amount of
nitrogenous matter.All proteid principles require a considerable
amount of chemical alteration before they are fitted for the metabolic
changes of the organism; the processes of assimilative conversion are
more complex than those undergone by fats and amyloids; and it follows
that there is proportional danger of disturbance of these processes
from overwork.Moreover, if nitrogenous food is in excess of
tissue-requirement, it undergoes certain oxidation changes in the blood
without becoming previously woven into tissue, with resulting compounds
which become positive poisons in the economy.The kidneys and skin are
largely concerned in the elimination of these compounds, and the
frequency with which these organs become diseased is largely due, no
doubt, to the excessive use of unassimilated nitrogenous food.Then,
again, if food be introduced in excess of the digestive capacity, the
undigested portion acts directly upon the stomach as a foreign body,
and in undergoing decomposition and putrefying changes frets and
irritates the mucous membrane.It can scarcely be a matter of doubt
that large groups of diseases have for their principal causes excess of
alimentation beyond the actual requirements of the system.All such
patients suffer from symptoms of catarrhal indigestion, such as gastric
uneasiness, headache, vertigo, a general feeling of lassitude,
constipation, and high- urine with abundant urates, together
with varied skin eruptions.Such cases are greatly relieved by reducing
the amount of food taken, especially nitrogenous food, and by a
systematic and somewhat prolonged course of purgative mineral waters.The waters of Carlsbad,
Ems, Seltzer, Friedrichshall, and Marienbad, and many of the alkaline
purgative waters of our own country, not unfrequently prove valuable to
those who can afford to try them, and their value shows how often
deranged primary assimilation is at the foundation of many human
ailments.The absurd height to which so-called restorative medicine has
attained within the last twenty years or more has contributed largely
to the production of inflammatory forms of indigestion, with all the
evil consequences growing out of general deranged nutrition.The use of indigestible and unwholesome food entails somewhat the same
consequences.This may consist in the use of food essentially unhealthy
or indigestible, or made so by imperfect preparation (cooking, etc.).Certain substances taken as food cannot be dissolved by the gastric or
intestinal secretions: the seeds, the skins, and rinds of fruit, the
husks of corn and bran, and gristle and elastic tissue, as well as
hairs in animal food, are thrown off as they are swallowed, and if
taken in excess they mechanically irritate the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane and excite symptoms of acute dyspepsia, and not unfrequently
give rise to pain of a griping character accompanied by diarrhoea.Symptoms of acute dyspepsia also frequently follow the ingestion of
special kinds of food, such as mushrooms, shellfish, or indeed fish of
any kind; and food not adapted to the individual organism is apt to
excite dyspeptic symptoms.Appetite and digestion are also very much
influenced by the life and {444} habits of the individual.The diet,
for instance, of bodily labor should consist largely of digestible
nitrogenous food, and meat, par excellence, should be increased in
proportion as muscular exercise is increased.For all sorts of muscular
laborers a mixed diet is best in which animal food enters as a
prominent ingredient.Thus, it has been found, according to the
researches of Chambers, that in forced military marches meat extract
has greater sustaining properties than any other kind of food.But with
those who do not take much outdoor exercise the error is apt to be, as
already pointed out, in the direction of over-feeding.It cannot be
doubted at the present time that over-eating (gluttony) is one of our
popular vices.Hufeland says: "In general we find that men who live
sparingly attain to the greatest age."While preventive medicine in the
way of improved hygiene--better drainage, better ventilation, etc.--is
contributing largely to the longevity of the race, we unfortunately
encounter in more recent times an antagonizing influence in the elegant
art of cookery.Every conceivable ingenuity is resorted to to tempt men
to eat more than their stomachs can properly or easily digest or
tissue-changes require.The injurious consequences of such over-feeding
may finally correct itself by destroying the capacity of the stomach to
digest the food.But, on the other hand, in many nervous forms of dyspepsia the weak
stomach is not unfrequently made weaker by severely restricted regimen,
and especially is this the case with mental workers.Theoretical and
fanciful considerations sometimes lead to physical starvation.This is
apt to be the case with dyspeptics.Men who toil with their brain
rather than their muscles, whether dyspeptic or not, require good,
easily-digested mixed diet.It is a popular error to suppose that drugs
can take the place of such food, especially drugs which are supposed to
have a reconstructive influence over the nervous system, such as iron
and phosphorus.The expression of Buchner, "No thinking without
phosphorus," captivating to theoretical minds, has gained much
notoriety, and has doubtless led to the excessive use of that drug in
nervous forms of indigestion.There never was a period when phosphorus
was so universally prescribed as the present.It enters into endless
combinations with so-called nerve-tonics.Of the injurious influence of
the drug in many cases of functional indigestion there can be no doubt;
and the statement itself, so often quoted, that "the amount of
phosphorus in the blood passing through the brain bears an exact
proportion to the intensity of thought," is calculated to mislead.T.
K. Chambers, author of the excellent _Manual of Diet_, makes the
statement that "a captive lion, tiger, leopard, or hare assimilates and
parts with a greater amount of phosphorus than a hard-thinking man;
while the beaver, noted for its power of contrivance, excretes so
little phosphorus that chemical analysis cannot find it in its
excreta."In the wonderful adaptations and regulative mechanisms of
nature we may trust largely to the natural law of supply and demand in
maintaining a proper equilibrium.It may be doubted, indeed, whether we
require at any time more phosphorus for brain- and nerve-tissue than
can be found in such food as contains digestible phosphatic salts.The
natural demand for food grows out of healthy tissue-change.An appetite
to be healthy should commence in processes outside of the stomach.Food may also be introduced into the stomach in an undigestible form
{445} from defects of cookery.The process of cooking food produces
certain well-known chemical changes in alimentary substances which
render them more digestible than in the uncooked state.By the use of
fire in cooking his food new sources of strength have been opened up to
man which have doubtless contributed immeasurably to his physical
development, and has led to his classification as the cooking animal.With regard to most articles the practice of cooking his food
beforehand is wellnigh universal; and especially is this the case with
all farinaceous articles of food.The gluten of wheat is almost
indigestible in the uncooked state.By the process of cooking the
starchy matter of the grain is not only liberated from its protecting
envelopes, but it is converted into a gelatinous condition which
readily yields to the diastasic ferments.Roberts, in his lectures on
the _Digestive Ferments_, points out the fact that when men under the
stress of circumstances have been compelled to subsist on uncooked
grains of the cereals, they soon fell into a state of inanition and
disease.Animal diet is also more easily digested in the cooked than in the raw
state.The advantage consists chiefly in the effects of heat on the
connective tissue and in the separation of the muscular fibre.In this
respect cooking aids the digestive process.The gastric juice cannot
get at the albumen-containing fibrillae until the connective tissue is
broken up, removed, or dissolved.Hot water softens and removes this
connective tissue.Hence raw meat is less easily digestible.Carnivorous animals, that get their food at long intervals, digest it
slowly.By cutting, bruising, and scraping meat we to a certain extent
imitate the process of cooking.In many cases, indeed, ill-nourished
children and dyspeptics digest raw beef thus comminuted better than
cooked, and it is a matter of observation that steamed and underdone
roast meats are more digestible than when submitted to greater heat.Some interesting observations have been made by Roberts on the effects
of the digestive ferments on cooked and uncooked albuminoids.He
employed in his experiments a solution of egg albumen made by mixing
white of egg with nine times its volume of water."This solution," says
Roberts, "when boiled in the water-bath does not coagulate nor sensibly
change its appearance, but its behavior with the digestive ferments is
completely altered.In the raw state this solution is attacked very
slowly by pepsin and acid, and pancreatic extract has no effect on it;
but after being cooked in the water-bath the albumen is rapidly and
entirely digested by artificial gastric juice, and a moiety of it is
rapidly digested by pancreatic extract."It is a mistake, however, to suppose that cooking is equally necessary
for all kinds of albuminoids.The oyster, at least, is quite
exceptional, for it contains a digestive ferment--the hepatic
diastase--which is wholly destroyed by cooking.Milk may be
indifferently used either in the cooked or uncooked state, and fruits,
which owe their value chiefly to sugar, are not altered by cooking.The object in introducing here these remarks on cooking food is to show
that it forms an important integral part of the work of digestion, and
has a direct bearing on the management of all forms of dyspepsia.Haste in eating, with imperfect mastication, is a common cause of
indigestion in this country.Mastication is the first step in the
digestive {446} process.It is important, therefore, that we have good
teeth and that we take time to thoroughly masticate our food, for by so
doing we prepare it for being acted upon by the juices of the stomach.Time is also necessary in order that the salivary secretion may be
incorporated with the alimentary substances.By the salivary diastase
starch is converted into sugar and albuminoids are prepared for the
action of the gastric juice.If these changes take place imperfectly,
the stomach can scarcely regain in gastric digestion what was lost in
imperfect mastication and insalivation.Haste in eating is one of the
American vices.It grows out of the temperament of our people.We are
jealous of lost time, and unfortunately this time is too often taken
from the stomach.We bolt our food with unseemly haste, and pay the
penalty in ruined stomachs.Many cases of indigestion are greatly
relieved, if not permanently cured, by simply doubling or quadrupling
the time occupied in eating.Irregularity in the intervals between meals, such as taking one meal
only in twenty-four hours or taking food before the preceding supply
has been digested, is another fruitful source of indigestion.The
digestive process, in the natural order of change, is confused; changes
which should take place are delayed; and the results are such as arise
from excessive eating.Moreover, the stomach lacks the rest so
essential to digestion.The necessary interval, however, between meals
varies with the nature of the food taken."Between the extremes of the
carnivorae," says Ewald, "which feed once in twenty-four hours, and the
herbivorae, which never have done with the business of feeding, man
holds a middle place, but not without permitting the recognition in the
course of his life of a sort of transition from the herbivora to the
carnivora.Infants should have the breast during the first three weeks
as often as they wake; after that every two hours to the third month;
then up to dentition every three hours; and later there should be five
meals in twenty-four hours."But to this general statement there are,
of course, many exceptions.Under certain pathological conditions food
should be taken in small quantities at short intervals.This is
especially the case in chronic gastric catarrh and in feeble digestion
of nervous subjects.Such patients are not unfrequently improved by
becoming again infants or herbivorae.By the use of an exclusive milk
diet or peptonized milk gruels, given in small quantities at
comparatively short intervals of time, the stomach may be so
accommodated that it will digest without discomfort a large amount of
nourishment within a given time.To S. Weir Mitchell of Philadelphia we
are indebted for some valuable observations bearing upon this point of
forced alimentation.To the causes of indigestion already alluded to may be added the habit
of spirit-drinking, especially the habit of taking alcohol undiluted on
an empty stomach, which rarely fails after a time to engender dyspeptic
symptoms.It is a prominent factor in the production of chronic gastric
catarrh--a condition more frequently present in painful indigestion
than any that have been named.It is one of the most common diseases
met with in practice.Indeed, all causes already alluded to involve,
sooner or later, if they are constantly operative, irritative and
catarrhal conditions of the mucous membrane of the stomach, so that we
find it difficult at times--indeed impossible--to separate purely
functional from subacute inflammatory forms of dyspepsia.Practically,
we simply study the {447} subject in the relative degrees of prominence
of the one condition or the other.But, in a still more comprehensive sense, indigestion is caused by
disturbance of organs directly associated with the stomach in the
digestive process.All organs closely associated with each other in
their physiological functions are apt to become associated in morbid
action.The clinical recognition of this is a matter of great
importance in the management of gastric affections.And first in the
order of importance in such association is the liver.So closely,
indeed, are the liver and stomach functionally associated in the
process of primary assimilation that they may be considered parts of
the same great digestive apparatus.Hence disturbance of the
liver--either in the formation of glycogen, the destruction of
albuminoid matter, or the secretion of bile--is immediately
communicated to the stomach.It may be difficult to say which of these
separate and distinct functions of the liver is most at fault; that can
only be a matter of physiological inference.In the one case, for
instance, the dyspeptic may be fairly well nourished, yet his
elimination may be bad.In the other there is no failure of the
destructive and excreting functions, but those concerned in the
assimilation of fat and peptones are disordered, so that the patient is
not well nourished, so far as the fatty element is concerned.This is
the more common form, and a form not unfrequently associated with
pulmonary consumption.The liver finally becomes fatty--a condition
usually found associated with the constitutional forms of phthisis.The pancreas is also closely associated with the stomach, and its
secretion is of essential value in the digestive process.It is to be
regretted that our precise knowledge of its diseases is in such
striking contrast with its importance in the animal economy, and yet it
can scarcely be doubted that in dyspeptic symptoms associated with
failure of digestion of starchy, albuminous, and fatty elements of food
there is disorder of the secretion of the pancreas.Hence in the
treatment of the early stages of pulmonary consumption and other
disorders associated with deficient digestion and assimilation of fatty
substances the importance of directing our attention to the condition
of the liver and pancreas, as well as to the stomach.That morbid states of the intestinal track occupy a prominent place in
the etiology of dyspepsia is also a well-recognized clinical fact.Indeed, constipation of the bowels is an almost universal accompaniment
of deranged digestion, and when persistent for years it is apt to lead
to the most disastrous consequences.These are mainly in the direction
of lessened elimination from the intestinal glandulae.The general
symptomatology of deficient excretion from these glandulae is closely
analogous to the same condition of the liver: there is impairment of
the general health; the clear florid complexion disappears; the patient
becomes of a greenish or sallow hue; the blood is altered in quality;
fatigue is experienced after the slightest exertion; the nights are
restless; and there is great tendency to mental despondency.Moreover,
constipation often precedes the gastric symptoms.The diminished
muscular activity of the intestinal track extends to the stomach; its
movements are diminished; food is not properly mixed with the gastric
juice, and by being too long retained in the stomach in a comparatively
undigested state acetous fermentation in the saccharine and starchy
articles of diet is set {448} up, acid eructations and a sour taste in
the mouth being commonly complained of.Dyspepsia associated with this
condition of the intestinal track cannot be relieved until the
constipation is relieved, and by overcoming the constipation the
dyspeptic symptoms often disappear.Mention has been made of the baneful influence of certain mental states
in the production of dyspeptic symptoms.But there are forms of
indigestion due to local nervous disturbance existing elsewhere than in
the nerve-centres.This was ascribed by the older writers to what they
termed consensus nervorum, or sympathy, by which "the operation of a
stimulus is not limited to the nerves immediately irritated, but is
extended to distant parts in known or unknown connection with the
irritated nerves."An intimate acquaintance with this law of sympathy
is of the utmost importance in the study of the functional forms of
dyspepsia, for no other organ of the body is subjected to such a wide
range of reflected nervous disturbance as the stomach.Morbid
sympathetic impressions are transmitted mainly through branches of the
vaso-motor nerve of the semilunar ganglia of the abdomen, and from the
pneumogastric to the stomach.Thus, a pregnant uterus not unfrequently
produces very troublesome vomiting; some females suffer from nausea and
indigestion during each menstrual period; and the more chronic forms of
pelvic irritation, such as a flexed uterus, and endometritis,
cervicitis, or tender ovary, may be the continuous exciting cause of
most troublesome forms of nervous dyspepsia.There is also close
sympathy of the stomach with the lungs and heart through the
distribution of the pneumogastric.So also may fixed points of
irritation in any part of the nervous system be reflexly transmitted to
the stomach, giving rise to most pronounced symptoms of indigestion.And it is evident that in all such cases but little can be accomplished
in the way of relieving the dyspeptic symptoms until the cause upon
which they depend is removed.The treatment must have reference mainly
to the removal of such cause.Lastly, all the causes mentioned finally concur in producing
irregularities of the mechanism of digestion; and this may be done by
disturbing either the muscular movements of the stomach or in
suspending or perverting the gastric solvents, or in these two
conditions combined.Referable to the Stomach.--The symptoms which attend
and indicate the presence of functional dyspepsia are such as accompany
in a greater or less degree almost all cases of chronic gastritis.Clinically, so far as the direct gastric symptoms are concerned, it is
difficult to separate them.The more prominent of the local symptoms
are--a sense of fulness and distension after meals, discomfort during
the digestive process, derangement of appetite, acid eructations,
flatulence, regurgitations of food, and sometimes nausea and vomiting.There is seldom severe pain; the sensation is rather that of
uneasiness.Exceptionally, however, there may be pain, which radiates
from the stomach to the shoulders, and may pass down the left arm so as
to simulate angina pectoris.But it may be readily distinguished from
that complaint by coming on after food, and not after exertion.In
other cases a sense of constriction may be accompanied by dyspnoea,
arising from impeded movements of the diaphragm from being pushed
upward by the distended stomach, or there may be heartburn, with an
ill-defined sense of burning felt in the epigastrium; {449} but thirst,
so frequently present in chronic gastritis, is, as a rule, absent in
functional dyspepsia.These symptoms are manifested in varying degrees
of prominence in individual cases, and some of them are rarely found
present.Thus, nausea and vomiting are not characteristic features of
the chronic forms of functional dyspepsia, and as a rule epigastric
tenderness is entirely absent.In markedly hysterical subjects or in
persons whose nervous system has been unduly excited by alcohol there
may be shrinking from the slightest touch upon pressure; but in these
cases the tenderness is not confined to the stomach, nor is it
increased by deep pressure.In some cases there is an unnatural craving
for food--a symptom rarely if ever observed in structural lesions of
the stomach--and now and then it happens that the appetite becomes
depraved, especially with hysterical patients.They crave indigestible
and unnatural substances, such as earth, chalk, and substances wholly
devoid of alimentary properties.Impairment of appetite, however, is
the more common feature of this form of indigestion.Flatulence and eructations are generally complained of, the flatulence
being accompanied by a painful sense of fulness, affecting in equal
degree the stomach and small intestines.It is derived principally from
putrefactive or fermentative changes of the ingesta, which are
imperfectly elaborated in the stomach.The gases consist of carbonic
acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and the hydrocarbons,
the butyric and acetic fermentations furnishing the hydrogen and
carbonic acid gas.In addition to these marsh gas is formed by a
special fermentation, the basis of which exists in the cellulose taken
with vegetable food.In excessive meteorism from paralysis of the
intestines the gas is principally nitrogen; the marsh-gas fermentation
results from the ingestion of certain easily-fermentable vegetables,
such as cabbage, cauliflower, etc.In a certain proportion of cases regurgitation occurs from the stomach.The liquor regurgitated may be intensely acid from the presence of some
of the fatty acids, probably butyric, lactic, or acetic.Exceptionally,
it may be insipid or brackish, constituting what is known as pyrosis,
or water-brash.The fluid is usually tasteless and without smell, and
in reaction it is neutral to test-paper.It contains sulphocyanuret of
potassium, and it has been supposed therefore to be only saliva.The
quantity thrown up may vary from a spoonful to a pint or more.It
affects females more than males, and especially those who subsist upon
coarse and indigestible food.It is best treated by astringents--such
as kino, krameria, logwood, or tannin--administered in the intervals
between digestion, so that they may act directly on the mucous
membrane.The oxide and nitrate of silver are thought by some to be
superior to the vegetable astringents.Cardialgia is a painful condition of the stomach, usually referred to
its cardiac orifice, and is popularly known as heartburn.It is met
with in both functional and organic disease of the stomach.It is very
constantly present in chronic catarrhal gastritis, and evidently
depends upon the presence of an acid, for it is usually promptly
relieved by alkalies, such as chalk, magnesia, soda, or alkaline saline
waters.Food containing much fat, starch, or sugar should be avoided.Nausea and vomiting are only occasional symptoms of functional
dyspepsia.When vomiting does occur it may take place at different
times {450} and with varying degrees of severity, differing in this
respect from the nausea and vomiting of subacute gastritis, which takes
place, if at all, soon after the ingestion of food.The time of
vomiting and the character of the matter ejected are liable to great
variation in functional dyspepsia.It may be the result of direct
irritation of morbidly sensitive gastric nerves, or it may be a reflex
phenomenon; it may follow soon after the ingestion of food, or it may
come on when the stomach is empty; the material vomited may be simply
food but little altered or an alkaline ropy mucus; it may consist in
the acid juices of the stomach or in a neutral watery fluid; or the
ingesta may have undergone fermentative and putrefactive changes from
either insufficient amount of the gastric solvent or from narrowing
(constriction) of the pyloric extremity, in which case the yeast fungus
(Torula cerevisiae) or the Sarcina ventriculi may be found in great
abundance in the vomited matter.Vomiting of this kind usually occurs
some time after eating.The gastric juice itself checks putrefaction;
so also does the admixture of bile.In the absence of these natural
antiseptics fermentation takes place.But it would be erroneous to
suppose that the fermentative dyspepsia is the primary disease; it is a
symptom which can be permanently corrected only by correcting the
condition upon which it depends.Among the most noticeable of the phenomena referable to other organs
than the stomach are those connected with the liver and the alimentary
canal.The tongue in dyspeptic troubles varies much in character.In
reflex sympathetic indigestion it is not unfrequently clean; in hepatic
dyspepsia it is generally thickly coated with a white or yellow fur.The symptoms are such as pertain more especially to chronic
gastro-duodenal catarrh, such as nausea, epigastric oppression, furred
tongue, heartburn, acid eructations, flatulent distension of the
stomach and bowels, unpleasant taste in the mouth, offensive breath,
loaded urine, frontal headache, irritability, and hypochondriasis.Constipation, as we have seen, is an almost universal accompaniment of
functional dyspepsia, sustaining to it not unfrequently a causative
relation.It is undoubtedly one of the most common of the slighter
ailments of civilized life, and exerts a wide influence in deranging
the general health."It is quite extraordinary how many different
derangements of health may result from imperfect action or a torpid
state of the secreting and expelling structures of the large bowel.There may be violent and persistent nerve-pains, referred to the back,
or hip, or groin, and certain other symptoms which lead pessimist
practitioners, excelling in the discovery of neuroses, to diagnose
structural changes in some part of the spinal cord or the antecedent
state which is supposed to lead to them" (Beale).Pains in the loins
and thighs, violent lumbar pain, and certain remediable forms of
sciatica are sometimes due to imperfect excretion of the lower part of
the alimentary canal.And it is even possible that a condition of
hypochondria bordering on insanity may be brought about by
long-continued defective action of the bowels.In exceptional cases of
dyspepsia diarrhoea may be present.This is more frequently the case
when indigestion is associated with a congested state of the liver, in
which case the symptom should be regarded as curative.Excessive
irritability of the muscular walls of the stomach, superadded to weak
digestion, may also be followed by lienteric forms of diarrhoea.Undigested {451} food hastily finds its way into the intestinal track,
and not unfrequently appears in the fecal evacuations.Functional derangements of the stomach are often accompanied by pale
urate deposits in the urine.It may contain an excess of phosphates,
and in microscopical examination crystals of the oxalate of lime are
frequently found, constituting a special affection described by
Golding-Bird as oxaluria.He associated it with irritative dyspepsia,
hypochondriasis, and exhaustion of nerve-power.This form of dyspepsia
is best managed by the mineral, vegetable, and acid tonics, to which
may be added small doses of nux vomica, with the usual adjuvants of
good air and exercise, freedom from anxiety and care, cold sea-water
baths, and well-selected, generous animal diet.Another form of dyspepsia is sometimes associated with a peculiar form
of dizziness--gastric vertigo.German writers speak of it as abdominal
dizziness, and Trousseau calls it vertigo stomicale.It is usually an
acute symptom, begins without any premonition, and is liable to be
confounded with disease of the brain.It sometimes occurs soon after a
meal, but more often when the stomach is empty (Trousseau).It perhaps,
in a majority of cases, depends upon dyspepsia, but it has to be
differentiated from organic brain disease, from cerebral anaemia,
cerebral hyperaemia, the slighter forms of epilepsy, Miniere's disease,
and general nervous exhaustion and depression.But in many cases it
will be found that treatment directed against the dyspepsia cures the
vertigo.Dyspeptic patients are also liable to skin diseases, and especially is
this observed in the gastro-duodenal forms of indigestion.Disorders of
the skin, such as urticaria, erythema, lichen, eczema, and other allied
conditions, are well-recognized external indications at times of
disordered conditions of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane.Thus,
it is a matter of common observation that the gastric symptoms increase
when the eruption on the surface disappears.The general influence of the nervous system over the function of
digestion is perhaps the most remarkable feature of the disease, so
that disturbed innervation becomes conspicuous in its symptomatology.Languor, drowsiness after
taking food, depression of spirits, irritability, hypochondriasis,
sleeplessness, palpitation, dry cough, dyspnoea, are all of common
occurrence; and the mental disturbance--the anxiety, gloom, and
sadness--is to many dyspeptics more distressing than absolute pain.It is impossible, however, to present, in this connection, a complete
clinical history of functional dyspepsia, for the reason that it is
associated with so many separate and distinct affections, the dyspepsia
itself being symptomatic of these affections.PATHOLOGY.--But little is known of the pathology of the purely
functional forms of dyspepsia beyond what is expressed by the terms
atony and asthenia.These express simply certain states of the system
with which atonic dyspepsia is so frequently found associated.Pathological anatomy has shown, however, that some cases are dependent
upon, or associated with, certain appreciable alterations of the
stomach, such as atrophy of the mucous membrane or fatty degeneration
of its walls; and not unfrequently it is the seat of the so-called
amyloid or lardaceous degeneration, although this albuminoid
infiltration or cloudy {452} swelling is more frequently the
accompaniment of chronic inflammatory process.But Jones and Fenwick
have shown that these conditions may occur independently of
inflammation.However, upon this point we are compelled to speak with
caution.The boundary-line between functional and structural diseases
is not always clearly defined.Functional and structural troubles of
the stomach are certainly very intimately associated.Moreover,
symptoms of purely functional dyspepsia are so frequently associated
with the subacute forms of gastritis that the pathology of the disease
becomes, from necessity, doubtful and complex.It can only be studied
in connection with certain states or conditions of which functional
derangement of the stomach is a symptom readily recognized during life.In the light of more advanced physiological and pathological researches
we may expect the limits of purely functional dyspepsia to be much
restricted.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of atonic dyspepsia must have special
reference to its etiology.It is usually a chronic disease, and has to
be discriminated from subacute or chronic inflammation of the stomach.This is the more difficult because many symptoms exist in common in
both varieties of indigestion.But in functional or atonic dyspepsia
the symptoms are not so continuous; there is less epigastric
uneasiness, less tenderness, less nausea or loathing of food, less
thirst, and less acidity and heartburn, less emaciation, less cerebral
and nervous disturbance, and the constitutional symptoms are also less
severe.The tongue, as a rule, is not so thickly coated, is not so red
or broad and flabby, the papillae are less marked, the breath less
offensive, and the urine, instead of showing a condition of lithaemia,
is not unfrequently pale and sometimes neutral, depositing oxalates and
phosphates, especially in feeble, broken-down conditions of the nervous
system.With other painful affections of the stomach, such as ulcer and cancer,
it is not likely to be confounded, especially when in these affections
pain, vomiting, and haematemesis are present.TREATMENT.--The first and leading indication is to remove, as far as
possible, all causes of the disease, and this requires patient research
and much diagnostic skill.Suggestive hints of treatment may be found
in connection with the discussion of the varied etiology of the
disease.We can, in conclusion, only allude to the matter in a very
general way.Special cases must furnish their own indications of
treatment.In many cases a condition of nervous asthenia will be found prominently
present.A leading indication, therefore, irrespective of the special
determining cause, is to improve the general health of the patient; and
this is accomplished by all means which invigorate the system
generally.And first in the order of importance are diet and regimen.It is evident that if a patient eat too much or too often, or if he eat
indigestible or unwholesome food, or lead an indolent and luxurious
life, nothing can be accomplished by way of drugs in the relief of the
disease.Excessive alimentation is, as we have seen, a most prolific
source of the disease.Tempted to excess by great variety and by the
ingenuity of culinary refinements, the stomach is burdened beyond its
capacity of digestion and beyond the actual requirements of the system;
and especially is this the case with those who live sedentary, indoor
lives.In all such cases it is absolutely essential that the digestive
organs have rest.{453} Better even in cases of doubt reduce the diet
for a time below the actual wants of the system until waste products
are thoroughly removed and appetite is revived.The benefit derived in
some instances from the protracted use of purgative mineral waters is
largely attributable to the restricted regimen enforced and to the
washing out of the system the waste products.On the other hand, too great or too protracted abstemiousness may
equally impair the digestive process.In ordinary forms of atonic
dyspepsia we should seek rather, by appropriate treatment, to raise the
digestive capacity to the level of digesting good, healthy, nutritious
food, than to reduce the food to the low standard of feeble digestion.But it is a mistake to suppose that this can be accomplished by simply
forcing food upon a stomach that lacks capacity of digestion.As to the kind of diet, no precise rule is suited to all cases.Within
certain limits individual experience must be consulted.But these
experiences are not always reliable.Dyspeptic patients, more than any
others, are apt to have fancies.Certain general rules, therefore,
should be insisted upon.The food should be wholesome and digestible;
it should be well cooked, well masticated, and taken at regular and not
too long intervals.The intervals of time between meals depend upon
circumstances already referred to.In some cases small quantities of
easily-digested food should be taken at short intervals.In cases of
feeble digestion of nervous subjects milk diluted in Seltzer water, or
milk and lime-water, or peptonized milk, may be taken in liberal
quantities at comparatively short intervals of time.Sometimes
isinglass, arrowroot, or ground rice may be advantageously combined
with the milk, to which tender, undone meats may be added.Peptonized Food.--Recently the attention of the profession has been
attracted to artificially digested food.The essential acts of
digestion are known to be chemical transmutations.Albuminoid
substances are changed into peptones and starchy matters are changed
into dextrin and sugar.To Roberts, in his excellent lectures delivered
in the Lumleian course before the Royal College of Physicians of London
in 1880, we are indebted for valuable information on the digestive
ferments and in the preparation and use of artificially-digested food;
and from these lectures we shall derive most of the information we
possess at present.It has been demonstrated that an extract of the
stomach or pancreas, in water, has to a certain extent the same powers
as the natural secretions of these organs.Hence, says Roberts, it is
possible for us to subject articles of food beforehand to complete or
partial digestion.Heat approximatively accomplishes the same thing.In
the practice of cookery we have, as it were, a foreshadowing of this
art of artificial digestion.Heat and digestive ferments alike aid
gastric digestion.In case of the lower animals the whole process has
to be accomplished by the labor of their own digestive organs.Artificially digested food may be prepared in two ways--either by
following the gastric method with pepsin and hydrochloric acid, or by
following the intestinal method and using extract of pancreas.Both of
these plans have had special advocates.Roberts claims that the latter
yields by far the better results."The pancreas not only acts upon
albuminous substances, but also upon starch.Pepsin, on the other hand,
is {454} quite inert in regard to starch.Moreover, the products of
artificial digestion with pepsin and acid are much less agreeable to
the taste and smell than those produced by pancreatic extract."The
pancreas of the pig, according to Roberts, yields the most active
preparation, but the pancreas of the ox or the sheep may be employed.The pancreas of the calf is not active on starchy materials.A very
active extract of pancreas is now prepared, and is easily obtainable,
with directions for making peptonized milk, milk gruel, milk punch,
soups, jellies, blanc-manges, beef-tea, enemata, etc.It is important
to remember that peptonized foods do not keep well, especially in warm
weather.If a quantity sufficient for twenty-four hours be prepared at
any one time, the quantity which remains over twelve hours should be
reboiled before using.Food thus peptonized is indicated in feeble
conditions of digestion and when the derangement of digestion results
from causes pertaining to the condition of the stomach itself--_i.e._
catarrhal forms of dyspepsia.As a rule, the food should be such as will require the least possible
exertion on the part of the stomach.Raw vegetables should be
forbidden; pastries, fried dishes, and all rich and greasy compounds
should be eschewed; and whatever food be taken should be eaten slowly
and well masticated.Many patients digest animal better than vegetable
food.Tender brown meats, plainly but well cooked, such as beef,
mutton, and game, are to be preferred.Lightly-cooked mutton is more
digestible than beef, pork, or lamb, and roast beef is more digestible
than boiled.Pork and veal and salted and preserved meats are
comparatively indigestible.Bread should never be eaten hot or
fresh--better be slightly stale--and bread made from the whole meal is
better than that made from the mere starchy part of the grain.Milk and
eggs and well-boiled rice are of special value.But to all these general dietetic rules there may be exceptions growing
out of the peculiarities of individual cases.The aged, for obvious reasons, require less food than the
young; the middle-aged, inclined to obesity and troubled with feeble
digestion, should avoid potatoes, sweets, and fatty substances and
spirituous liquors; persons suffering from functional derangements of
the liver should be put, for a time, on the most restricted regimen;
while, on the contrary, the illy fed and badly-nourished require the
most nutritious food that can be digested with comfort to the patient.The general regimen should be tonic and invigorating.The patient
should have the benefit of the best possible hygiene.Under this head
may be mentioned suitable clothing, fresh air, moderate exercise,
sunlight, baths, rest, regular hours, and the abandonment of all bad
habits.No single measure has such marked influence on the digestive
powers of the stomach as systematic, well-regulated muscular exercise
in the open air, and especially if the exercise be accompanied by a
cheerful mental state.Hunting, fishing, boating, are known to excite the keenest appetite for
food, and the stomach will digest substances that would distress it
under other circumstances.Exhaustion, however, is to be carefully
avoided.Horseback exercise is a remedy of much value, especially in
the hepatic forms of indigestion.The mental and moral treatment of the purely functional forms of {455}
indigestion are amongst the most powerful means we possess.As an
etiological factor certain morbid mental states rank first, as we have
seen, in the order of importance.Grief, despondency, and despair are
effectual barriers to digestion, and in a less degree mental worry
seriously interferes with the process.It is a matter of prime
importance, therefore, that the patient's mind be pleasantly occupied,
that he should be free from all care and mental worry, and that he
especially be kept from dwelling, if possible, upon his own bodily
ailments.This is often best accomplished by travel, when practicable,
in foreign countries, where everything will be novel and new and
calculated to lead him away from himself.Get him to travel, says
Watson, in search of his health, and the chances are in favor of his
finding it.We have the authority of Sir James Johnson also for saying
that no case of purely functional dyspepsia can resist a pedestrian
tour over the Alps.We come now to discuss the medical treatment of dyspepsia, which,
though not unimportant, is subordinate to the general hygienic measures
already referred to.General hints of treatment have been made in
connection with special causes mentioned in the text.We seek, in a
general way, by therapeutic measures--

1st.To stimulate the secreting and muscular coats of the stomach;

2d.To supply materials in which it is supposed the gastric juice is
defective;

3d.To lessen abnormal irritability;

4th.To combat special symptoms or conditions which may hinder the
digestive process.To meet these indications innumerable remedies have been recommended,
but they are of benefit only as they counteract the conditions upon
which the dyspepsia depends.For loss of appetite, if there are no
contraindications to their use, the vegetable bitters are often useful,
such as quassia, gentian, and columbo.Of these columbo is the simplest
of its class, but none more generally useful than mistura gentianae
with soda.The Hydrastis canadensis has also peculiar claims as a
bitter stomachic.It, perhaps more than any of the bitters, promotes
gastric secretion in feeble digestion, and has at the same time
peculiar salutary effects on the enfeebled condition of the chronically
inflamed gastric mucous membrane.It is supposed also to have a
stimulating effect on the pancreatic secretion.It may be given in the
form of a fluid extract combined with glycerin and small doses of nux
vomica.Among the specific stimulating nerve-tonics, nux vomica, or its
alkaloid, strychnia, deserves special mention.In small tonic doses it
is specially indicated in conditions of general nervous prostration
associated with a tendency to hypochondriasis.In such cases we
frequently observe pale urine, containing an excess of the phosphates.The mineral acids are valuable additions to the bitter tonics in all
broken-down conditions of the nervous system.In administering nux
vomica care should be taken as to limitation of time and dose.The
excessive or prolonged use of the drug is apt to produce serious
general nervous disturbance, the secondary condition being often the
opposite to that for which it was prescribed.Temporary saccharine
diabetes is not unfrequently one of the results.In atony of the mucous membrane, with morbid sensibility and slow {456}
digestion, ipecacuanha is a remedy of much value.It was first brought
into prominent notice in connection with gastric affections by Budd,
since which time it has been more or less used by the profession.In
torpid, slow digestion, with depraved or lessened gastric secretion, it
is of undoubted value.It should be given on an empty stomach at least
half an hour before meals.The dose should be short of producing
nausea.We may commence with two to four drops of the tincture or wine
of ipecac, and gradually increase until we find the point of tolerance;
or it may be given in the form of pill in doses of a quarter or a half
grain before meals, combining it with rhubarb in three- or four-grain
doses.Ipecacuanha may be administered at the same time we are giving
the mineral acids, or mineral acids with pepsin.Adjuvants to Digestion.--In atony of the stomach the gastric mucous
membrane responds feebly to the stimulus of food.There is failure in
both muscular movement and gastric secretion, with slowness of
digestion as a result.To meet this condition we seek to increase the
digestive power by the addition of certain principles natural to the
digestive process--viz.the mineral acids, pepsin, and pancreatin.Of
these acids, the hydrochloric should be preferred, because it is the
natural acid of the gastric juice.Lactic, nitro-hydrochloric, and
phosphoric acids have also been used with benefit.There can be no
doubt of the efficacy of either of these preparations.They are best
given when the stomach is empty, so that they may directly act on the
relaxed atonic mucous membrane.Half an hour before or two hours after
a meal is the best time for their administration, and to be of benefit
they should be administered for a length of time.From fifteen to
twenty minims of the dilute hydrochloric or nitro-hydrochloric acid may
be given in some bitter tincture or infusion for months.An elegant
preparation may be made by adding the acid to tincture of orange-peel
and syrup of lemon.Aromatic tincture, tincture of ginger, or glycerin
may be added in some cases.It is important that remedies administered
in gastric affections should be made pleasant as possible to the
patient.Metallic preparations are of use in some cases.If for any reason they
are preferred, the perchloride of iron is one of the very best
preparations.Arsenic and zinc may also be tried in small doses.Pepsin and its Uses.--Of the efficacy of pepsin as an artificial
substitute for the normal solvent of the food adverse opinions have
been expressed, but in spite of the most critical scepticism as to its
action its use since first introduced into medicine has steadily
increased.It has been shown to be the natural constituent of the
gastric juice and glands, and as a natural ferment, when combined with
hydrochloric acid, it constitutes the most important solvent of the
nitrogenous portions of our diet (Habershon).There is a vast number of
different preparations of pepsin in the market, and some of them are
doubtless of little value.We ought to be quite sure that the article
is what it purports to be.The pepsina porce is the best preparation,
one grain of which, says Beale, ought to thoroughly digest one hundred
grains of boiled white of egg in three or four hours at a temperature
of 100 degrees F. His test as to the value of pepsin is as follows:
"One hundred grains of hard-boiled white of egg, cut into thin slices,
may be placed in a wide-mouthed bottle or flask with one ounce of water
and twenty drops of dilute hydrochloric acid.One {457} grain of pepsin
powder is to be added, and the mixture placed before a fire at a
temperature of about 100 degrees F. The flask is to be shaken from time
to time.In about an hour the white of egg begins to look transparent
at the edges, and in about four hours it will be completely dissolved
if the pepsin is good."In cases of feeble digestion from deficiency of
gastric juice pepsin is a valuable adjuvant to the digestive power, and
may be given with advantage in connection with the mineral acids or
with ipecacuanha or capsicum before meals.Special Remedies.--There are certain symptoms characteristic of the
different forms and complications of dyspepsia that require special
remedies.It is especially indicated where
there is a morbid painful condition of the gastric nerves.The
subnitrate or carbonate of bismuth may be given in ten- or twenty-grain
doses, suspended in water by means of mucilage of acacia, and flavored
with ginger or peppermint.It should always be given on an empty
stomach.Other elegant preparations supposed to be improvements upon
these have been recommended, and may be tried.In cases of anaemia, if there are no contraindications, iron may be
tried.If digested and assimilated, it improves the blood, and this is
often the first step in the direction of restoring functional activity.Of the preparations of iron, none is perhaps superior to the
perchloride.The saccharo-carbonate and the ammonio-citrate are also
valuable and unirritating salts of iron, and may be given with other
tonics.Ferruginous mineral waters slightly charged with carbonic acid
are well tolerated in small doses.The free dilution favors the action,
and is frequently more acceptable to the stomach than the more
concentrated forms.From one-half to one glassful may be taken at a
time; and the use of iron in this form may be preceded or accompanied
by the administration of small doses of quinia and of the bitter
tonics.But it is a mistake to commence the treatment by the
indiscriminate use of iron, quinine, and nerve-tonics.The
contraindications to the use of iron are irritable and inflammatory
states of the mucous membrane, or dyspepsia associated with deranged
conditions of secretion, as manifested by dirty tongue and loaded
urine.When the nervous system is prominently at fault, nux vomica, arsenic,
and the nitrate and oxide of silver often prove to be valuable
remedies.Here also benefit may be derived from the lighter ferruginous
preparations; indeed, few combinations have greater influence over the
nervous system than the joint action of arsenic and iron.Much benefit
may also be derived, in special cases, from methodical
hydro-therapeutic treatment.If judiciously used it strengthens the
nervous system, stimulates the organic functions, and increases the
power of vital resistance.And in some cases of nervous dyspepsia
electricity gives good results.In all cases of nervous prostration as
much wholesome food should be taken as the stomach can easily digest.In hepatic forms of indigestion there is no substitute for an
occasional mercurial cathartic, for, notwithstanding adverse criticism,
clinical experience has taught the great value of this drug upon the
upper portion of the intestinal track.The mode of operation may be
doubtful, but the result is unquestionable.In functional disturbance
of the liver or morbid conditions of the upper portion of the
intestinal track, as indicated {458} by the loaded tongue, sallow
complexion, want of appetite, and lithaemia, no remedy will give so
much relief as a few broken doses of calomel, followed by a saline
aperient; or eight or ten grains of blue mass, with a grain of
ipecacuanha, may be administered at bedtime, followed by a saline
draught in the morning.After the bowels are thoroughly unloaded by a
mercurial, great advantage may be derived from a systematic course of
the aperient mineral waters--the Friedrichshall, the Hunyadi, Carlsbad,
or some of the mineral waters of our own country.The hepatic form of
indigestion cannot be relieved until we relieve the congested hepatic
portal system, and this is best accomplished by the general line of
treatment here indicated.The simple vegetable bitters, with or without
alkalies, may be used at the same time or subsequent to this treatment;
but they are often worse than useless until we secure freedom of
abdominal circulation.The diet should be light and nourishing, and the
patient should spend most of his time out of doors.Horseback exercise
is peculiarly advantageous.But in many cases of the more chronic forms of dyspepsia the colon is
as atonic as the stomach, and therefore the bowels require special
attention.In colonic dyspepsia all active purgation should be avoided,
and salines, such as sulphate of magnesia, the Hunyadi and other saline
mineral waters, should be specially prohibited.The most useful
aperients in such cases are rhubarb, aloes, senna, colocynth, or
podophyllin.Few laxatives answer a better purpose than the ordinary
compound rhubarb pill.It may be improved, in special cases, by
combining with it extract of nux vomica or belladonna.When there is no
affection of the rectum to forbid its use, the watery extract of aloes
answers very well, and, unlike many cathartic substances, the dose need
not be increased, nor does it disturb the digestive process.It may be
given in one-sixth of a grain up to a grain or more, and its purgative
action may be improved by being reduced to a state of very minute
division and combining with it small doses of belladonna.Belladonna
itself is a useful remedy.According to the observations of Harley, it
"tones and tightens the longitudinal fibre, while it relaxes the
circular;" and long before this theory of its action was suggested,
Trousseau called attention to its singular efficacy in producing easy
and natural evacuations from the bowels.It is important to observe its
mode of use.It should be given in sixth of a grain doses of the
extract in the morning a half hour or hour before breakfast.Its
efficacy may be increased by combining with it small doses of the
watery extract of aloes.In colicky conditions of the bowels two- or
three-drop doses of tincture of colocynth sometimes act wonderfully
well.In obstinate constipation the free use of diluents at the
termination of digestion is often attended with excellent results.But
the hygienic and dietetic treatment of constipation is even more
important than the medicinal, such as outdoor exercise, the cold bath,
rubbing, kneading the bowels, and the use of bread made of whole meal,
oatmeal, and an abundant supply of fresh vegetables and fruits.Nausea and vomiting, occasional symptoms of functional dyspepsia, may
be relieved by various agents, such as effervescing draughts,
lime-water, oxalate of cerium, hydrocyanic acid, creasote, ice, and
alkalies.When vomiting is dependent on fermentation or putrid action of the
contents of the stomach with development of sarcinae, it may be checked
{459} by carbolic acid or by creasote, or by the sulphite of soda or
sulphurous acid; and in irritable conditions of the stomach bismuth is
a valuable remedy.It may be given with alkalies or with
finely-triturated animal charcoal.Gastric pain needs treatment appropriate to the circumstances under
which it arises.Sometimes it is relieved by regulating the ingesta or
the intervals at which it is taken; sometimes by warm carminative
stimulants or by chloric ether, ginger, or brandy.If the pain is more
constant, approaching a condition of gastralgia, hydrocyanic acid and
bismuth are more effective remedies.But it cannot be too strongly
stated, in conclusion, that in the management of the atonic forms of
dyspepsia hygienic treatment is of prime importance.The hopeful future
of medicine lies in the direction of promoting healthy nutrition, and
this is best accomplished by the careful adaptation of food and
exercise and modes of living to individual cases of disease.Gastralgia (Gastrodynia, Cardialgia, Spasm of the Stomach).Under the head of neuroses of the stomach have been variously described
the conditions indicated in the heading of this section; and a certain
amount of confusion has arisen in the use of these terms from the fact
that they represent subjective sensations common alike to organic and
functional forms of indigestion: pain, for instance, is felt in
gastritis, cancer of the stomach, and ulcer of the stomach.Indeed, it
rarely occurs independently of some disorder of digestion or structural
lesion of the stomach.By gastralgia, considered as a distinct affection, however, we mean a
purely neuralgic condition of the sensory fibres of the stomach,
excluding inflammatory and structural changes on the one hand and
chronic forms of atonic dyspepsia on the other.The attacks are usually
periodical in character, with constricting pain in the pit of the
stomach, and the intervals are not necessarily associated with symptoms
of dyspepsia.It chiefly occurs in females of nervous temperament at
the catamenial periods.Two forms of the disease have been described--one depending on
hyperaesthesia of the sensory fibres of the pneumogastric, the other on
hyperaesthesia of the solar plexus.This may be correct in theory, but
practically it can be of little importance to make the discrimination,
even if it were possible to do so.Clinically, the disease is presented to us in two forms.In one the
pain is agonizing, comes on without premonition, is sometimes
intermittent or remittent in character, and conveys to the sufferer the
idea of spasm; hence it has often been described as colic of the
stomach.If not relieved by appropriate remedies, the pain may last for
hours or days.In the other the pain is more of
a neuralgic character and is not so severe.There may be varying
exacerbations which may last for months or years.This is not an
unfrequent form, and may consist simply in the more acute form becoming
chronic.ETIOLOGY.--With the limitation indicated, we have naturally to seek the
causes of the affection, says Ziemssen, in two directions: either in
the abnormal nature of the irritants to which the gastric nerves are
subjected, {460} or in an altered condition of the nerves themselves,
which therefore react abnormally with the normal degree of irritation.This briefly covers the whole ground of the etiological relations of
the disease.The predisposing causes are such as produce general depressed vitality,
embracing at the same time special conditions of extreme nervous
excitability.Some of these general conditions were pointed out while
speaking of atonic forms of dyspepsia.Indeed, the two conditions are
often associated, and practically it may be difficult to separate them,
although the connection between them is not necessarily an invariable
one.Like atonic dyspepsia, gastralgia is apt to affect anaemic
persons, and notably anaemic females at menstrual periods.Thus, the
association between gastralgia, chlorosis, and hysteria is a matter of
common observation.Of 350 cases noted by Briquet, only 30 had no signs
of gastralgia; and this observation is a fair average expression of the
experience of others.Certain blood-poisons are also known to give rise to the disease.Infection of the blood by malaria was observed by Niemeyer to produce
spasm of the stomach instead of the paroxysms of intermittent fever;
and in malarious regions of the United States the same observation has
been made.Gout and rheumatism are also known to sustain causative
relations to the disease.Certain idiosyncrasies also enter as a factor
into the somewhat complex etiology of the disease.Thus, some persons
suffer immediately from eating certain kinds of food and fruits, such
as shellfish, strawberries, honey, and even milk and coffee.The pain
and spasm are produced by direct contact with the sensory fibres of the
stomach; _i.e._ they react abnormally to normal stimulation.But
disease of the nerve-centres may enter into the causation.This is seen
by the effects of morbid growths impinging upon nerve-trunks; their
terminal branches often become extremely irritable and painful, and
this condition may be intensified by idiosyncrasy.Excessive acidity of
the stomach, seeds of fruit, certain articles of food, the presence of
worms in the stomach, and draughts of ice-water may simply act as
exciting causes to a centric predisposition.Of the more direct causes operating upon nerve-centres, all the
depressing passions and emotions deserve special mention; so do all
causes which produce an exhausted state of innervation, such as
venereal excesses, onanism, the abuse of narcotics, etc.But chief among the causes are those of a reflex kind.Painful
affections of the kidneys, irritable conditions of the bladder,
diseases of the liver, and, above all, morbid conditions of the female
genital organs, sustain a direct and close relation to painful and
spasmodic conditions of the stomach.It is a common accompaniment of
versions, flexions, prolapses, inflammations, erosions of the os, as
well as diseased conditions of the ovaries.When such local conditions
are associated with anaemia and hysteria, patients rarely fail to have
painful gastric complications.SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms of gastralgia, like most of the neuroses, are
characterized by severe pain occurring in paroxysms, followed by
remissions, and sometimes by complete intermissions, again to recur
with varying degrees of severity.The pain in the acute variety is of a
violent, spasmodic character, and is referred to the epigastrium
immediately beneath the ensiform cartilage.Frequently it extends from
the epigastrium to the back and chest and into the right and left
hypochondrium.{461} No one has so briefly and so accurately described
the immediate attack of gastralgia as Romberg: "Suddenly, or after a
precedent feeling of pressure, there is severe griping pain in the pit
of the stomach, usually extending into the back, with a feeling of
faintness, shrunken countenance, cold hands and feet, and small,
intermittent pulse.The pain becomes so excessive that the patient
cries out.The epigastrium is either puffed out like a ball, or, as is
more frequently the case, retracted, with tension of the abdominal
walls.There is often pulsation in the epigastrium.External pressure
is well borne, and not unfrequently the patient presses the pit of the
stomach against some firm substance or compresses it with his hands.Sympathetic pains often occur in the thorax under the sternum, in the
oesophageal branches of the pneumogastric, while they are rare on the
exterior of the body.The attack lasts from a few minutes to half an
hour; then the pain gradually subsides, leaving the patient much
exhausted, or else it ceases suddenly with eructation of gas or watery
fluid, with vomiting, with a gentle soft perspiration, or with the
passage of reddish urine."Besides the violent paroxysmal pain referred to the stomach, symptoms
of derangement of other organs are often present.Prominent among these
are hysterical phenomena which are protean in their manifestations, and
if not recognized they are liable to mislead.Thus, with gastric pain
there may be violent palpitation of the heart, with shortness of
breath, cough, globus, hiccough, and convulsive affections, and in a
certain proportion of cases there is marked melancholia or
hypochondriasis.The stomach is variously modified in its function.In many cases it is
entirely unaffected.The desire for food may be indeed increased, and
its ingestion may give a sense of relief.In others vomiting may be
severe, while in still others there may be merely a condition of
anorexia.The tongue is, as a rule, clean, the skin cool, the
temperature undisturbed, and there is absence of tenderness over the
epigastrium.DIAGNOSIS.--Functional and structural troubles of the stomach very
markedly simulate each other; therefore the diagnosis requires to be
made with great caution, and this is best done by a most rigid and
careful exclusion; and this becomes difficult because the symptoms are
mainly subjective.It is a matter of great moment in differentiating the disease to take
into account all constitutional states which predispose to nervous
asthenia.Thus in conditions of chlorosis and hysteria the presumption
is strong that the pain is neurotic or spasmodic in character; and this
presumption is intensified if there be no accompanying constitutional
symptoms which indicate inflammatory action.We exclude inflammatory
conditions of the stomach by the frequent and complete intermissions,
by the absence of thirst, tenderness, and all febrile movement.Moreover, the pain of inflammatory affections, unless produced by
corrosive poisons, is rarely so severe as in neuralgic affections; nor
are nausea and vomiting so uniformly present in neurotic affections.Then the time at which the pain is experienced is a matter of
importance.In inflammatory affections it is felt immediately on taking
food.In neurotic affections it may occur when the stomach is empty,
and it is not unfrequently relieved by food.In ulcer and cancer of the
stomach pain is a common element, and, as in {462} gastralgia, it is
referred to the epigastrium.But in gastric ulcer the pain is rarely
absent; it is of a dull, gnawing character, is strictly localized in
the centre of the epigastrium, and is aggravated by pressure and by
food.Moreover, the vomited matter often contains blood.In cancer of
the stomach the pain is not as severe and spasmodic in character as in
gastralgia, the vomiting is a more prominent symptom, and the material
vomited has the characteristic cancerous look.Cancer is more apt to
occur too in advanced life, and it is characterized by a steady
progressive emaciation.Gastralgia may also be confounded with rheumatism of the abdominal
muscles as well as neuralgia of the inferior intercostal nerves, and it
is liable to be confounded with colic resulting from biliary calculi.Colicky pains in the transverse portions of the colon may also be
mistaken for pains in the stomach."It is no exaggeration to say," says
Trousseau, "that in perhaps half the cases which are called gastralgia
the affection is nothing more than cholalgia."The more fixed the pain
is to one spot, and the nearer it is to the median line, the greater is
the probability of its being gastric.PROGNOSIS.--Notwithstanding the severe and apparently alarming nature
of the symptoms, the prognosis of gastralgia is in the main favorable,
although the prospect of a permanent and speedy cure is small.The
duration of the disease depends on the nature and persistence of the
exciting causes, and these are so often associated with an exhausted
state of innervation that speedy recovery from the disease cannot be
promised.In the simpler varieties, caused by improper food, the
disease will disappear by removing the cause, and the hysterical forms
are liable to disappear with advancing life.So also cases arising from
malaria, anaemia, chlorosis, uterine disease, rheumatism, and gout may
be relieved by removing the cause.But there are cases produced by
unknown causes, and especially cases associated with a general and
unexplained cachexia, in which the prognosis is not good.TREATMENT.--This is both radical and palliative.The radical treatment
must have reference to the diseases which have given rise to it.If,
for instance, the gastralgia can be traced to sympathetic disturbances
of the uterine organs, no remedy can be permanently effective until the
cause is removed.Since chlorosis and anaemia are so often found
associated with it, benefit may be expected from the ferruginous
preparations in some form.Iron occupies a prominent place as a
remedial agent.The precipitated carbonate is to be preferred on
account of its peculiar influence over the nervous system, and
especially over painful neuralgic conditions.It may be given in drachm
doses, or even larger, combined with ginger or aromatic powder.If the
stomach will not tolerate it, other preparations may be tried.Quinia is a valuable addition to iron, and it is specially valuable in
cases of suspected malarious origin.Sometimes a few large doses will
break up the paroxysmal pains as no other agent will.In the more chronic forms of the disease arsenic is one of the most
reliable remedies we possess.It has a well-deserved reputation in the
treatment of a great variety of nervous affections, and in none more
than in the disease now under consideration.It should be given for a
length of time--three or four minims of Fowler's solution, gradually
increased and {463} given immediately after food--and in cases of
anaemia it should be associated with iron.In irritable, broken-down conditions of the nervous system nux vomica,
or its alkaloid strychnia, is a useful remedy.But it is a powerful
stimulant to the spinal nerve-centre, and care should be used in the
too protracted use of the remedy or in its administration in too large
doses.It may be combined with the phosphate or the valerianate of
zinc, or either may be given separately.The nitrate and oxide of
silver have also been used with asserted success.Nitrate of silver may
be given in pill form with opium.If there is a strong hysterical element, the bromides and
antispasmodics may be tried in connection with remedies calculated to
strengthen the nervous system.The judicious employment in such cases
of hydro-therapeutic measures is of great value.Good results are also
obtained from electricity.Among palliative remedies--_i.e._ remedies that act directly on the
painful gastric nerves--the subnitrate of bismuth has long been
regarded with great favor.Its action is mainly local; it may be given,
therefore, in drachm doses or more three or four times a day.If there
is nothing to contraindicate its use, aconite or dilute hydrocyanic
acid may be given with the bismuth.For the immediate relief of pain, however, there is no substitute for
opium.The subcutaneous injection of morphia will generally give
immediate relief.But there are many reasons why we should try other
palliative remedies.In a disease so painful in character a remedy that
gives such prompt relief is liable to abuse.The formation of the opium
habit should be carefully guarded against.Spirits of chloroform may be
tried, therefore, as a substitute for opium, followed by large draughts
of hot water--hot as the patient can possibly sip it.Hot water of
itself often gives immediate relief.An important part of the treatment consists in well-regulated hygiene.Change of air, travel, pleasant mental surroundings, together with
carefully regulated diet, are in a majority of cases more efficacious
than drugs.Acute Gastritis (Acute Gastric Catarrh).Reasoning from the great functional activity of the stomach, from its
daily periodical change of blood-supply, from its extensive glandular
arrangement, and from its important relations to the functions of
vegetative and animal life, we might readily infer that it would be
frequently the seat of acute and destructive inflammation.But it is
remarkable, all things considered, how seldom that is the case.Indeed,
acute spontaneous inflammation of the stomach is almost unknown.When
it occurs it most frequently results from toxic causes.In less severe
forms, however, not attended with immediate danger to life, it is
undoubtedly a disease of frequent occurrence, and in this more
comprehensive sense the subject will be considered in the present
section.The mucous membrane alone is usually the seat of the disease, and for
this reason it has become the custom of late years to describe it as
gastric {464} catarrh.This may be objectionable, for the reason that
it does not include gastric inflammation of every grade of intensity.The term catarrh is generally applied to much more simple anatomical
structures than those pertaining to the stomach.We shall consider the
subject therefore under two forms--namely, (1) Catarrhal; (2)
Erythematous gastritis.ETIOLOGY.--Certain conditions predispose to the disease.Acute
catarrhal gastritis is specially liable to occur in those who
habitually suffer from a disordered stomach.This may arise from
functional disturbance of the digestive process on the one hand, or
mechanical obstruction on the other.Mechanical causes are widespread
in their influence.Thus, weak heart-action from any cause tends to
disturb the normal adjustment between the two sides of the
circulation--arterial and venous.An abnormal amount of blood
accumulates on the venous side of the circulation, and chronic passive
hyperaemia of the abdominal viscera is the result.The effect of this
upon the stomach is to lower its functional activity and to invite
inflammatory action.The same condition results from structural
diseases of the heart, lungs, or liver.Persons suffering from valvular
diseases of the heart, emphysema of the lungs, or cirrhosis of the
liver are strongly predisposed to diseases of the stomach.Gastric
troubles are also apt to supervene during the progress of various
diseases.Gouty and rheumatic persons are specially prone to suffer from gastric
catarrh; and eruptive disorders, such as scarlatina, diphtheria, etc.,
tend to erythematous forms of gastric inflammation.Catarrhal gastritis
is also a very common sequence of the whole class of malarious fevers,
including yellow fever, intermittents, and remittents.In its more
acute form gastric inflammation supervenes in the course of yellow
fever; and what is observed here in an extreme degree exists in a minor
degree in all the so-called malarious fevers.Intermittent and
remittent fevers are always attended with gastro-duodenitis and
gastro-hepatitis.The degree of this inflammatory complication
determines the continued character of the fever.Upon this point the
writer has very decided views based upon a wide field of observation in
malarious regions of country.We have lost ground in the treatment of
these diseases by directing our attention almost exclusively to the
febrile and malarious, to the exclusion of the inflammatory, elements.Quinia is inoperative in the cure of these troublesome and often fatal
complications.Indeed, it is more than that: it is often positively
injurious.Arrest the local phlegmasia and secure freedom of abdominal
circulation, and we at once get the action of the specific remedy.It
may be going too far to affirm, as did Broussais, that gastritis
sustains a causative relation to all forms of fever, but that
gastro-duodenitis is an important secondary condition in all forms of
malarious fever, complicating and perpetuating the febrile state, there
can be no doubt; and it is equally clear that it constitutes one of the
most dangerous complications.Excessive alimentation, with the
injudicious use of tonics and stimulants, so often resorted to in the
treatment of these fevers in their early stages, only serves to
intensify the local inflammation.Abolish the congestive and
inflammatory element of a remittent, and it at once becomes an
intermittent.Mention has been made of weak heart-action as a factor in catarrhal
{465} gastritis; also mechanical impediments to the return of blood
from the stomach to the heart.The stomach is thereby kept in a
constant state of congestion, the nutrition of the mucous membrane is
less active than in health, and its solvent juices are more sparingly
secreted.Thus in long-continued congestion produced by mitral disease
of the heart Samuel Fenwick found the formation of pepsin impaired.He
made artificial gastric juice from the mucous membrane of three males
dying of heart disease, and he found, on the average, only 2-9 grs.of
albumen were dissolved, whereas the amount digested by the mucous
membrane of persons who had died of other maladies was 4 grains.In the
cases of three females a still smaller amount of solvent power was
displayed.These facts have important bearings upon the question of
alimentation in fevers and the conditions in which there is chronic
congestion on the venous side of the circulation.Long-continued
passive hyperaemia of the stomach from any cause not only impairs its
functional activity, but strongly predisposes to inflammatory
complication.Acute erythematous gastritis is most frequently met with in children.It is a very common form of disease in early life, and the local nature
of the malady is frequently overlooked.Few questions in practical
medicine are more embarrassing to the physician.It has been known and
described as gastric and remittent fever, as continued typhoid, and
even as acute hydrocephalus.Writers and teachers describe and
dogmatize, while practical men hesitate at the bedside.There is little
doubt but in the background of these febrile manifestations in children
there is often an acute erythematous gastritis, which is more
successfully treated by a rigid milk diet, small doses of calomel and
bismuth, mucilaginous drinks, cooling saline laxatives, and sometimes
leeches applied to the epigastrium, than by the heroic doses of quinia
so frequently resorted to.We must not, in this connection, lose sight of the fact, so clearly
pointed out by Broussais, that inflammation of the stomach is often
secondarily repeated in the brain.The whole field of clinical
observation abounds in illustrations of this.How often, for instance,
we can trace the sick headache, the delirium, and even convulsive
movements of the voluntary muscles, to primary gastro-intestinal
irritation!In the play of the sympathies morbid irritative action is
transmitted from the organic to the cerebro-spinal nerves; and of all
portions of the abdominal viscera the stomach and upper portion of the
intestinal track are the most frequent seat of these intense morbid
sympathies.Remedies which cool the stomach and lessen inflammatory
action diminish the excitement of the brain, and vice versa.EXCITING CAUSES.--Among the direct exciting causes of gastric
inflammation--exclusive of acrid or corrosive poisons--the most
frequent in this country is the excessive use of alcohol.It acts most
injuriously when it is but slightly diluted and taken on an empty
stomach.And next to this pernicious habit, in the order of importance,
is the use of large quantities of food--more than the stomach has
capacity to digest, and more than is necessary for the wants of the
system.Excessive alimentation is a prolific source of gastric
inflammation.It generally manifests itself, however, in a chronic or
subacute form.Acute erythematous gastritis, so frequently met with in children, is
{466} often present in scarlatina.It is evidently not catarrhal in
character, for in the earlier stages there is no increased secretion of
mucus and but little injection of the mucous membrane.The changes are
observed in the deeper structures of the stomach, and principally in
the gastric tubules.They are much distended by granular, fatty, and
albuminous matter; and in this respect it is analogous to erythematous
affections of the skin with which it is associated in scarlatina.Finally, acute gastric catarrh may be excited by all causes that weaken
the digestive power either by weakening the gastric juice or by
retarding the movements of the stomach.ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS.--No disease requires more knowledge and caution
in determining post-mortem changes than those of the stomach.In the
first place, it presents in inflammatory conditions markedly different
degrees of intensity, with corresponding differences in anatomical
changes.Its diseases also present many special forms, and changes take
place after death which simulate morbid processes during life.Moreover, intense vascular injections are apt to disappear in the small
superficial vessels after death.This applies to all mucous membranes,
but specially to the mucous membrane of the stomach, which is the seat
of varying amounts of blood in their physiological limits during life.For this reason the observations of Beaumont made upon a living subject
are invested with peculiar interest.It will be remembered that in the
case of Alexis St.Martin the appearances noted were such as belong to
the milder forms of inflammation.Beaumont noticed in this case, after
indiscretions in eating or abuse of ardent spirits, a livid
erythematous redness of the gastric mucous membrane, with, at the same
time, dryness of the mouth, thirst, accelerated pulse, and, at the
height of the injection, an entire absence of gastric secretion.At
other times there was considerable muco-purulent matter, with oozing of
grumous blood, "resembling the discharge from the bowels in cases of
chronic dysentery."The fluid taken out through the fistulous opening
consisted mostly, however, of mucus and muco-pus which showed an
alkaline reaction.He describes also a condition of ecchymosis and
oozing of blood from certain red spots of the gastric mucous membrane,
and when thus limited the constitutional symptoms experienced by the
patient were correspondingly slight.Ecchymoses may be present in large
number, with exudates of false membrane, which Beaumont describes as
aphthous.Brinton also describes a severe form of gastritis which he
terms ulcerative, in which he observed hemorrhagic erosions.In the catarrhal form of gastritis the mucous membrane is covered with
a thick, tenacious, stringy mucus; it is softer than usual, and
generally thickened.It presents at the same time a dead-white
appearance, corresponding to Virchow's cloudy swelling--a condition
analogous to that which is observed in acute Bright's disease.Even
casts of the tubes are sometimes met with.This inflammatory change in the substance of the mucous membrane is
especially observed in the acute erythematous form of gastritis
complicating scarlatina.In the early stage there is no increased
secretion of mucus, and at a more advanced stage the membrane may be
even paler than usual.In cases of acute toxic gastritis intense redness is seen over the
entire {467} surface of the mucous membrane, followed by rapid
exudations and sloughing of portions of the membrane.In all forms of the disease there is a tendency to extension of the
inflammation into the duodenum and small intestines.In the more
chronic forms we almost invariably encounter the condition of
gastro-duodenitis.SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms of inflammation of the stomach present wide
differences in their intensity, depending upon the degree of severity
in different cases.In acute inflammation caused by the direct action
of poisonous irritants they are pronounced and highly diagnostic.The
patient immediately complains of burning pain, referred to the
epigastrium, followed by intense thirst and vomiting.The thirst is apt
to be very great and the act of vomiting painful.The vomited matters
contain mucus, saliva, sometimes bile, and not unfrequently, in fatal
cases, black, grumous, coffee-ground material.There is marked
tenderness on pressure, the pulse is frequent and small, coldness of
the surface is marked, and hiccough is apt to occur.The expression of
the patient is anxious, the abdominal muscles rigid, and, in fatal
cases, the prostration becomes rapidly extreme.These symptoms apply to acute cases of marked severity,
usually of toxic origin.In the milder forms of catarrhal gastritis more frequently met with
there is seldom complaint of pain.The sensation is rather that of
fulness, uneasiness, with more or less tenderness on pressure.The
symptoms are such as belong to acute indigestion and the embarras
gastrique of French authors.The phenomena may be those of a slight
bilious attack.The tongue is foul, the breath offensive, the bowels
confined, and the urine high- and scanty.There is also
generally a sense of fatigue, and soon secondary cerebral symptoms
supervene, such as cerebral hyperaemia, headache, vertigo, noises in
the ears, palpitation, sighing, yawning, dyspnoea, faintness, and in
severe cases marked physical and mental depression.Nausea and vomiting
are common, and if the inflammation extends to the duodenum and liver,
symptoms of gastro-hepatic catarrh manifest themselves.If fever
supervenes, urticaria sometimes complicates these attacks.In young children the inflammation is apt to involve a general catarrh
of the whole intestinal track.Thirst is excessive, followed by
vomiting and diarrhoea.The discharges are liquid, watery, offensive,
acid, and out of all proportion to the amount of fluid absorbed by the
stomach.The pulse becomes weak and fluttering, the skin pale, the
features pinched, the eyes sunken, and the extremities cold.The
tendency is toward rapid collapse and fatal issue.The symptoms
describe what is usually known as cholera infantum.It has its analogue
in the cholera morbus of adults.In erythematous gastritis nausea and vomiting are as general as in the
catarrhal form, but, unlike the catarrhal, pain at the epigastrium is a
prominent symptom.In
phthisical cases the sensation is rather that of rawness of the
oesophagus and stomach.Thirst is a troublesome symptom; the tongue is
red or dry and glazed; tenderness of the epigastrium is marked;
diarrhoea is generally present; and, as in the catarrhal form, the
stools are fetid and unhealthy.The disease shows a marked tendency to
become chronic.{468} DIAGNOSIS.--In the more acute forms of the disease the symptoms
are all highly diagnostic.Vomiting, burning pain of the stomach,
tenderness on pressure, intense thirst, with frequent and small pulse,
point with almost unerring certainty to acute gastric inflammation.But
vomiting of itself, however persistent, is not evidence of gastritis,
for it may be present from many other causes.If the vomiting be
attended by headache, it may be confounded with gastric irritability
from brain disease.Thus, chronic meningitis with persistent vomiting
strongly simulates gastritis, and in the case of children it is liable
to be mistaken for it.In gastritis the nausea is from the first a
pronounced feature of the disease.Vomiting in affections of the brain
is often unattended by nausea.In gastritis the tongue is more
frequently coated or red and glazed.Diarrhoea is also more frequently
present, especially in early life.In affections of the brain the
tongue may be clean and the bowels are usually obstinately confined.When there is much fever, gastritis may be confounded with remittent or
typhoid fever.In periods of childhood this mistake is specially liable
to occur, for there are many symptoms in common.In all such cases the
early history of the case ought to be carefully inquired into.In
gastritis we may be able to detect the cause in any particular case.The gastric symptoms are apt to occur suddenly, and, as already stated,
are prominent from the first.In meningitis the skin is more frequently
dry; in gastric catarrh perspirations are common.The more prominent
and characteristic symptoms of typhoid should also be carefully
excluded, such as the gradual invasion, peculiar eruption, bronchial
catarrh, enlargement of the spleen, gurgling in the right iliac fossae,
with tympanitic abdomen.Peritonitis, with vomiting, may be mistaken
for gastritis, but the diffuse tenderness, the fixedness of position,
the rigidity of the abdominal muscles, and the tympanitic distension
serve to guide us in our diagnosis.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis must have reference to the cause.The more
violent forms of the disease resulting from corrosive poisons are
generally fatal.Death is apt to take place in a few hours from a
condition of collapse.The immediate cause of death is failure of
heart-action.It is also a dangerous disease in the extremes of life.In its acute form in children it is apt to terminate fatally,
especially if it is not recognized early and judiciously treated.The
complications of the disease may also render the prognosis unfavorable.TREATMENT.--The most important indication of treatment, applicable to
all forms of gastric inflammation, is to secure complete or partial
rest for the inflamed organ.In dangerous cases no food should be taken
into the stomach.The patient should be nourished exclusively by
nutrient enemata.If food is permitted, it should be restricted to milk
and lime-water, administered in small quantities at short intervals.In
acute and dangerous cases, suddenly manifesting themselves, the
exciting cause should be carefully inquired into, and speedily removed,
if possible, by an emetic, or, if need be, by the stomach-pump, if the
poison be one which can be ejected; and following this antidotes are to
be administered according to the nature of the poison.To allay the intense thirst small pieces of ice should be swallowed at
frequent intervals, or, what is often more grateful to the patient,
iced {469} effervescing drinks in small doses oft repeated.Injections
of water may also tend to relieve thirst.To allay vomiting the
physician is often tempted to try a great variety of remedies which are
usually worse than useless, for they aggravate rather than relieve the
distressing symptom.For the purpose of quieting the stomach opium is
the most reliable remedy we possess.It is best administered
hypodermically.Fomentations may be applied over the epigastrium.Stimulants are, of course, contraindicated on account of their
irritating action on the inflamed membrane, but in case of rapid
tendency to death by failure of heart-action they should be
administered by the rectum or hypodermically.In milder cases--which are much the more common--physiological rest of
the organ is also a cardinal principle of treatment.In cases of any severity the patient should be
kept quiet in bed.For the condition of acute indigestion known as
embarras gastrique ipecacuanha in six- or eight-grain doses, given
three times within twenty-four hours, will often produce healthy
bilious stools, and in this manner accomplish the cure.One or two
grains of calomel may be added to each dose of ipecacuanha with
benefit.In all forms of catarrhal gastritis, especially if symptoms of
portal congestion are present, mild mercurial cathartics are attended
with benefit.Six or eight grains of calomel may be rubbed up with
sugar of milk and placed dry on the tongue, followed by a cooling
saline aperient.When diarrhoea is present in such cases, it should be
regarded as conservative, and encouraged by the administration of
half-grain or grain doses of calomel, combined with bismuth and
bicarbonate of soda.The diet should be restricted to milk and
lime-water or milk mixed with Vichy or Seltzer water.Demulcent drinks
should be freely given.In the slighter attacks effervescing drinks are
grateful to the patient; and if there be excessive formation of acid in
the stomach, antacids and sedatives should be administered.Bismuth has a peculiar sedative and antiseptic effect in the milder
forms of inflammatory action of mucous membranes.It is especially
valuable in gastro-intestinal troubles of children.Its action is
mainly local surface action, and may therefore be given in liberal
doses if necessary.Children may take from five to ten grains, and
adults twenty grains or more.Hydrocyanic acid adds to its sedative
qualities, or when pain is present, with diarrhoea, opium in some form
may be added.The salicylate of bismuth is specially indicated when we
want to add to the antiseptic qualities of bismuth.The general principles of treatment indicated here are applicable to
the so-called remittent fevers of children--namely, calomel in small
doses, combined with bismuth and bicarbonate of soda, followed by
occasional cool saline laxatives.Ipecacuanha is also a valuable agent
in correcting morbid gastro-intestinal secretions.When there is early
epigastric tenderness, with hot skin and elevation of temperature, two
or three leeches should be applied to the epigastrium, followed by warm
poultices of linseed meal.Dry cupping may also be used with benefit;
and if decided remissions occur, with suspicions of a complicating
malarious element, a few liberal doses of quinia may be tried.In many
such cases, however, it will be found unnecessary, and not unfrequently
hurtful.In acute gastro-intestinal inflammations of children--the
{470} temperature reaching 105 degrees or more--no febrifuge, in the
opinion of the writer, is equal to the cool or cold bath, repeated from
time to time until there is a decided reduction of temperature.But the
gastric inflammation, rather than the fever, should mainly claim our
attention.Great care is necessary during convalescence from acute gastric
disease, particularly as regards the hygienic management.The apparent
debility of the patient too often tempts the physician to the early and
injudicious use of tonics, stimulants, and excessive alimentation,
which, if persisted in, can scarcely fail to perpetuate a chronic form
of inflammatory action.Chronic Gastritis (Chronic Gastric Catarrh).There is perhaps no malady more frequently met with than chronic
gastric catarrh, and none more frequently misunderstood.It comprises
many different forms of gastric derangement, which are grouped under
the general head of inflammatory dyspepsia, with many symptoms strongly
simulating ordinary functional dyspepsia.It includes, in the author's
opinion, a large number of cases of obstinate chronic dyspepsia, which
are badly managed because not recognized as of inflammatory origin.ETIOLOGY.--In a more or less chronic form it is frequently met with as
a result of the acute affections.Hence the etiology is mainly that of
acute gastric catarrh.By mechanical causes which interfere with the portal circulation.In connection with certain constitutional states, such as gout,
rheumatism, phthisis, renal disease, certain eruptive diseases, and as
a sequence of malarious fevers.By the excessive use of alcohol and other gastric irritants.By errors of diet, especially excessive alimentation.By decomposition of ingested aliment owing to deficiency of gastric
juice.By all causes that weaken the digestive power and lower the general
tone of the system.Of all these causes, errors of diet are most apt to produce it, and to
perpetuate it when once established.And next to this, in the order of
importance, is the immoderate use of alcohol, especially by persons
whose general health and digestive power are below a healthy standard.Such persons are apt to suffer from irritative and inflammatory forms
of dyspepsia, which, in various degrees of intensity, alternate with
the acuter forms of embarras gastrique.The injudicious use of drugs may also be mentioned.There can be no
doubt that many transient and functional forms of indigestion merge
into the more chronic inflammatory forms of dyspepsia from the abuse of
stimulants, tonics, and purgatives.Anxious for relief, and urged on by
hope of recovery, the victims of functional dyspepsia are apt to have
recourse to every grade of quacks and to be subjected to every form of
harassing and mischievous treatment.Indeed, the use of potential and
irritating drugs, administered for all kinds of ailments, real or
imaginary, enters largely into the etiology of chronic gastric catarrh.These are mainly
{471} such as offer impediment to the return of blood from the stomach
to the heart.In acute cases the congestion may be very intense.Congestion of the same kind, but more gradual in its occurrence and
less in degree, may be present from all conditions affecting the
circulation of venous blood through the liver.General anaemia, by
producing weak heart-action, disturbs the normal adjustment between the
arterial and venous sides of the circulation.Blood accumulates in the
veins and capillaries, and morbid action propagates itself in a
direction contrary to the circulation.Hence in all conditions of
general anaemia there is tendency to dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema,
bronchorrhoea, special forms of liver disease, gastric catarrh, and
even temporary albuminuria.All mechanical obstructions to the free
transit of blood through the heart, lungs, or liver are followed by the
same results.A free secretion of mucus into the stomach is one of the
most commonly recognized.This
alkaline mucus, while it dilutes the digestive juices of the stomach,
furnishes favorable conditions for the development of low
micro-organisms, which contribute to the fermentative process.We may
not duly estimate the effects of these organisms on a mucous membrane
softened by long-continued passive hyperaemia.Malarious fevers, from their congestive tendency, give rise to the more
acute forms of gastro-enteric inflammation.In the more chronic forms
of intermittent and remittent fevers more or less gastric inflammation
is invariably present.Indeed, in all forms of fever gastric
inflammation is a complicating element, and the recognition of the fact
has an important bearing on the treatment.Certain constitutional diseases appear to involve special liability to
this affection, such as scrofula, phthisis, gout, rheumatism, syphilis,
and many chronic forms of skin disease; and in many cases the cause is
not apparent.ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS.--The gross appearance of the stomach in chronic
gastritis is thus admirably described by Broussais, who faithfully
recorded what he "observed during many years in the bodies of those who
have long suffered from distaste for food, nausea, and vomiting."These
observations were made long before morbid anatomy had thrown much light
on the more minute structural changes of organs, and the general
picture will be recognized as faithful to-day: "Softening, friability,
and the reduction into a kind of gelatinous mass commonly occurs in the
region of the lower part of the larger curvature of the stomach; and
when closely examined it is perceived that it is not only the mucous
membrane that has undergone that species of decomposition, but that the
muscular has participated in it, and that the whole of the cellular
tissue which united the three membranes has entirely disappeared.The
parietes of the viscus are then reduced to a very thin lamina of serous
membrane, commonly so fragile as to tear on the slightest handling, or
even already perforated without any effort on the part of the
anatomist.The pyloric region, on the contrary, has manifestly acquired
more consistence and thickness; the mucous membrane there presents
large folds, the muscular appears more developed, and the cellular and
vascular are injected; sometimes even a true scirrhous state is
observed there.The portion of the mucous membrane which covers this
scirrhus is sometimes {472} ulcerated, but that in the surrounding
parts and at the border of the ulcer, far from being softened, is, on
the contrary, tumefied, indurated, and injected.Finally, though there
may or may not be ulceration of the pylorus, it is always manifestly
hypertrophied, whilst the lower part of the great curvature is the seat
of softening and atrophy."These were the observations of the great anatomist apparent to the
naked eye.At the present time we can only confirm them by stating that
structural changes are particularly noticed in the pyloric region of
the stomach.The mucous membrane generally is vascular and covered with
a grayish, tough, transparent mucus.It is more opaque and thicker than
natural.The surface is usually changed in color: it may be red, brown,
ash-gray, slate-, or even black in spots.The darkened spots are
due to pigmented matter, and this is generally most marked in the
pyloric half of the stomach.It is most commonly met with in cases of
prolonged passive congestion of the stomach from portal obstruction,
and requires for its production the rupture of capillaries in the
superficial layers of the membrane and the transformation of the
haematin into pigment.The same condition often produces ecchymoses and
hemorrhagic erosions in spots.In other cases the mucous membrane is
strikingly uneven, being studded with numerous little prominences
separated from each other by shallow depressions or furrows.This
condition, which has been compared to granulations upon wounds, is
called mammillation.It is the etat mamelonne of Louis, and is
considered by him as a sure and constant sign of inflammatory action.Like many other structural changes, it is usually found in the
neighborhood of the pylorus.More rarely polypoid growths project from
the membrane, and little cysts also frequently appear in the mucous
membrane.Chronic inflammation tends to thickening of the mucous membrane.It
sometimes is not only greatly thickened, but acquires an extreme degree
of toughness.Exceptionally, however, the membrane, either entire or in
spots, may be abnormally thin.The thickening of the walls of the
stomach, when it involves the pylorus, gives rise to constriction of
the orifice and consequent dilatation of the stomach.When the disease has been of long standing the interstitial tissue
between the tubules becomes thickened, the stomach is changed in its
normal structure, and the tubules themselves become confused,
compressed, and much less straight and parallel than in the normal
state.Or they may in some cases be enlarged, according to Flint, in
consequence of swelling and parenchymatous or fatty degeneration of
their epithelial cells.Microscopic examination often shows changes
such as occur in other glandular organs.The glands and tubules become
the seat of degenerative changes, such as are observed in Bright's
disease of the kidney, and they are frequently found associated in the
same case.The mouths of the gastric tubules become blocked up, while
deeper parts are dilated into cysts; and at times they are atrophied or
filled with granular fatty matter.Many cases of persistent anaemia may be traced, according to Flint, to
this degenerative process of the gastric tubules.The SYMPTOMS of chronic gastritis are mainly those of difficult
digestion of an aggravated kind, and are liable to be mistaken for
those of {473} ordinary functional dyspepsia.Some points of
distinction were referred to in the section treating of functional
dyspepsia; and while there are many symptoms in common, it is vastly
important that the two forms of the disease should be early recognized,
for they are radically distinct in their pathology and treatment.We now speak of what is usually known as inflammatory, irritative, or
gastric dyspepsia--a persistent and aggravated form of indigestion
which has its origin in the stomach itself, in contradistinction to
dyspepsia which originates largely from causes outside of the stomach
and transmitted to it through nervous impression.The one is functional
and indirect; the other is inflammatory and direct.The symptoms referable directly to the stomach are mainly those of
difficult and painful digestion, and are alike characteristic of all
forms of indigestion, such as loss of appetite, sense of weight and
fulness of the epigastrium, distress after taking food, acidity,
eructations of gas, etc.But chronic gastritis is more frequently
accompanied by a burning sensation in the epigastric region,
accompanied by tenderness on pressure, which is generally increased
after meals.Sometimes this tenderness amounts to actual pain, which is
increased after meals.But we are liable to be misled by pain: gastric
pain is not a characteristic symptom; subacute forms of the disease may
exist without any fixed pain; the sensation is rather that of burning,
uneasiness, and oppression of the epigastric region.The appetite, as a
rule, is greatly impaired--indeed, the sense of hunger is rarely
experienced--and nausea and vomiting frequently follow the ingestion of
food.This is especially the case when catarrh of the stomach is
associated with renal disease, portal congestion, or chronic
alcoholism.Large quantities of mucus are brought up, the vomiting
taking place usually in the morning, and on examination of the mucus it
will frequently be found to contain sarcinae and large numbers of
bacterial organisms.When stricture of the pylorus is present the
vomiting of putrid, half-digested food usually takes place about the
termination of the digestive process.The tongue presents characteristics peculiar to chronic inflammation of
the stomach.In some cases it is small and red, with enlarged and red
papillae; in others, it is broad and flabby and somewhat pale; but in
either case, on close inspection, the papillae will be found red and
enlarged, this being more apparent on the tip and edges.In children of
scrofulous habits and in older persons of tubercular tendency the whole
organ is redder than natural, the papillae standing out as vivid red
spots.In other cases the catarrh of the stomach extends to the mucous
membrane of the mouth.In all cases of oral catarrh the tongue, instead
of being red and pointed, is large and apparently oedematous.It is
uniformly covered with a white or dirty brownish coat, and frequently
shows the impression of the teeth upon its edges.The secretions of the
mouth are depraved, the breath heavy and offensive, and the gums spongy
and unhealthy in appearance.It is rarely absent either in the acute or
chronic form of the disease.It is most marked in the intervals between
meals and in the evenings.It is rare in gastric catarrh of long standing that it does not extend
to the intestines, and occasionally from the duodenum to the ductus
{474} choledochus; in which case we have the combined symptoms of
gastro-intestinal catarrh associated with jaundice.The nutritive
system becomes implicated, and patients are especially prone to develop
any diathesis to which they may be liable.There remains a group of symptoms of great interest in the study of
gastric inflammation--important because liable to mislead as to the
real nature of the difficulty--namely, morbid conditions of the nervous
system.Few diseases have such a wide range of morbid sympathies, and
few, it may be added, are so generally misunderstood and
misinterpreted.Two main facts, as formulated by Broussais, deserve to
be restudied by the profession:

First, that irritations of the visceral parenchyma which do not
implicate their serous membranes only give rise to ill-defined
sensations, and they not painful;

Second, that most of the acute pains arising from visceral irritation
are rather referred to external parts than to the viscera themselves.Unless the seat of very acute inflammation, mucous membranes are
remarkably free from pain, and yet the gastric mucous membrane is the
seat of a most exquisite internal visceral sense and has a wide range
of morbid sympathetic disturbances.These sympathetic phenomena are
often treated for primary neuralgias.No fact in the clinical study of
disease deserves more careful consideration than this.Absence of pain,
then, is calculated to mislead.It is often only the sensation of
uneasiness, depression and melancholy, want of appetite, thirst,
nausea, loathing of food, and derangement of the bilious and gastric
secretions, that directs our attention to the stomach.Moreover, in
gastro-enteric inflammations pain is more frequently felt in parts
sympathetically affected than in the stomach itself."It is only when
irritations of mucous membranes are in the vicinity of the openings of
cavities that the irritations are distinctly perceptible in the seat
they occupy" (Broussais).Morbid irritative action commencing in the
stomach repeats itself in the cerebro-spinal system of nerves, and the
secondary irritation may develop a more immediately dangerous
inflammation than the primary.This is frequently observed in children,
who are specially prone to irritation of the visceral apparatus.Many
cases of primary gastric irritation terminate in acute cerebral
inflammation.Indeed, the greater number of phlegmasiae of the brain
are only sympathetic irritations issuing from primary inflammation of
the stomach.Short of inflammation, the transmitted irritation may
merely give rise to reflex convulsions, and in adults to sick headache,
or, if long continued, to conditions of hypochondria.Headache is a
prominent symptom of gastric irritation.It is not usually acute, but
rather a sense of fulness and pressure, sometimes felt in the frontal,
at other times in the occipital, region.Many cases commonly called
cerebral hyperaemia and cerebral anaemia are nothing more than
malassimilation from chronic gastric catarrh.This fact deserves to be
specially emphasized at present, for we are apt to consider the
cerebral the primary lesion.Vertigo, as in functional dyspepsia, is
also an occasional symptom, and very commonly patients complain of
extreme degrees of sleeplessness and disturbed dreams and nightmare.The heart's action is often disturbed in its rhythm, and sympathetic
dyspnoea leads to suspicion of disease of the lungs.And to all these
{475} nervous phenomena may be added unusual languor, lassitude,
irritability of temper, and a feeling of inability for either mental or
physical exertion.But in the play of morbid sympathies it must be borne in mind that the
stomach may be secondarily affected.Irritations of all organs are
constantly transmitted to the stomach from their very commencement.Hence the frequent loss of appetite, the thirst, the embarrassed
digestion, the deranged gastric secretion, and the altered color of the
tongue.This is markedly the case in all the malarious and essential
forms of fever.Gastric complication in these fevers is rarely, if
ever, absent, and if aggravated by the too early use of tonics and
stimulants and by harsh irritating cathartics, it becomes too often a
fatal complication.Gastric symptoms are also associated with other constitutional
disorders, such as phthisis, renal disease, rheumatism, gout, and
almost all forms of chronic eruptive diseases.Constipation is often obstinate,
and especially is this the case if the catarrhal condition is confined
to the duodenum.The lower down the inflammation the greater the
probability of diarrhoea, and when present the stools are offensive and
frothy; sometimes they are dry and scybalous and coated with a tough,
tenacious mucus which may form casts of portions of the intestinal
track.In other cases patients suffer from distressing intestinal
flatulence and a sense of general discomfort.Piles is a complication
frequently present without reference to complication of the liver.The urine is more frequently disordered than in any other form of
disturbance of digestion.The most common changes consist in an
abundant deposit of the urates; exceptionally, however--especially in
cases of long standing in which there are marked nervous symptoms
associated with defective secretion of the liver and pancreas--it may
be of low specific gravity and pale in color from the presence of
phosphates.Slight febrile movement is not uncommon.Finally, in all cases of chronic gastric catarrh the nutritive system
becomes deeply implicated--much more so than in functional disturbances
of the stomach.Emaciation is almost constantly present, the patient
often showing signs of premature decay.DIAGNOSIS.--The disease with which chronic gastritis is most liable to
be confounded is atonic dyspepsia, the chief points of distinction from
which have been already alluded to.In general terms it may be said
that in chronic gastritis there is more epigastric tenderness, more
burning sensation and feeling of heat in the stomach, more thirst, more
nausea, more persistent loss of appetite, more steady and progressive
loss of flesh, more acidity, more eructations of gas, more general
appearance of premature decay, and greater tendency to hypochondriasis.And yet all these symptoms, in varying degrees of prominence, may be
present in all forms of indigestion.To the points of distinction
already mentioned, then, a few circumstances may be added which will
afford considerable assistance in coming to a correct diagnosis:

1.The length of time the disease has uninterruptedly lasted.The local symptoms are never entirely absent, as is not infrequently
the case in functional dyspepsia.The uneasy sensations, nausea, oppression, or pain, as the
case may be, follow the ingestion of food.They are not so prominently
present when the stomach is empty.In chronic gastritis it will be found that
all the local symptoms are exasperated by the usual treatment of
functional dyspepsia.Stimulants and stimulating food are not well borne.Alcohol,
especially on an empty stomach, produces gastric distress.There is
also frequently slight febrile disturbance.Chronic gastritis, with nausea, vomiting, haematemesis, general pallor,
and loss of flesh, may be mistaken for cancer of the stomach.But in
cancer vomiting is about as apt to take place when the stomach is empty
as during the ingestion of food; pain is usually greater, especially
when the orifices of the stomach are involved; the tenderness is more
marked; the emaciation and pallor more steadily progressive; the
vomiting of coffee-ground material takes place more frequently; and the
disease is more rapid in its progress.The age and sex of the patient
may also aid us in our diagnosis.Cancer is more frequently a disease
of middle and advanced life, and localizes itself oftener in the
stomach of males than females.Finally, the discovery of a tumor would
remove all doubts.Haematemesis in chronic catarrh of the stomach is
almost invariably associated with obstruction to venous circulation in
the liver, heart, or lungs.In rare cases it may be difficult to distinguish chronic gastric
catarrh from ulcer of the stomach.In ulcer of the stomach pain is a
more prominent and constant symptom; it is more centrally located; the
vomiting after taking food is more immediate and persistent; the tongue
may be clean; flatulence is not a constant symptom; the appetite is
seldom much affected; the bowels are generally confined; and there is
nothing characteristic about the urine.TREATMENT.--In this, as in the more acute forms of the disease, rest of
the stomach is important.From mistaken notions of disease we are prone
to over-feed our patients, and thus seriously impair the digestive and
assimilative processes.In chronic inflammation of the stomach a
restricted diet is of prime importance.The physician should most
carefully select the patient's food, and urgently insist on its
exclusive use.This of itself, if faithfully persevered in, will often
effect a cure.The exclusive use of a milk diet--especially skim-milk--should be
thoroughly tested.In testing it we should allow two or three weeks to
elapse before any other food is taken.At the end of that time
soft-boiled eggs, stale bread, and well-cooked rice may be added, with
an occasional chop once a day.Some patients do not tolerate raw milk
well.In such cases we should thoroughly test the peptonized or
pancreatized milk or the peptonized milk-gruel, as suggested by
Roberts.This artificially-digested milk agrees wonderfully well with
many stomachs that cannot digest plain milk.Milk, in whatever form
administered, should be given at comparatively short intervals of time,
and never in quantity beyond the digestive capacity.Better err on the
side of under- than over-feeding.Nothing should be left to the fancy
or caprice of the patient.The food should be carefully selected by the
medical adviser, and given in definite quantities at definite times.Even the moral {477} effect of such discipline is healthful for the
patient.After testing milk diet for a time, we may gradually add small
quantities of rare and thoroughly minced meat.Milk, eggs, and rare
meat are more easily digested, as a rule, than starchy substances.Farinaceous food is apt to give rise to excessive acidity.But stale
bread may be added to the milk, and, if there is tendency to acidity,
better have it toasted thoroughly brown.In addition to the dietetic treatment of the disease, diluents,
timeously administered, are of essential service.As a rule, patients
are too much restricted from their use, under the supposition that they
dilute the gastric juice and thereby impair the digestive power.This
restriction is proper at, and for some time after, the ingestion of
food.But at the end of the first hour after taking food several ounces
of gum-water, or some mucilaginous fluid sweetened and rendered
palatable by a few drops of dilute muriatic acid, should be
administered, and repeated every hour during the digestive process.Diluents, thus administered, are not only grateful in allaying the
thirst of the patient, but are at the same time an essential part of
the treatment.The free use of demulcents at the termination of
digestion in the stomach is especially useful.Beyond these general principles of treatment, applicable to all
varieties of gastric catarrh, we must have reference to the varied
etiology of the disease.This, we have seen, is most complicated.Hence
the difficulty in prescribing any rules of treatment applicable to all
cases.We should seek here, as in all cases, to generalize the disease
and individualize our patient.Chief among remedial agents may be mentioned the alkaline carbonates.When combined with purgative salines they are specially valuable in
gastro-duodenal catarrhs associated with disease of the liver.These
are a very numerous class of cases, especially in malarious regions of
country, and when present in a chronic form lay the foundation of
widespread disorders of nutrition.No treatment in such cases is
effective until we diminish engorgements of the liver and spleen, and
nothing accomplishes this so well as the use of alkaline saline
laxatives.These may be assisted in their action by small doses of
mercurials.It was a cardinal principle among the older practitioners,
in the absence of more minute means of diagnosis, to look well to the
secretions; and what was their strength is, I fear, our weakness.Wonderful results often follow a course of the Carlsbad, Pullna, or
Marienbad waters, taken on an empty stomach, fasting, in the morning.While taking the waters a rigid and restricted diet is enforced.This
is an important part of the treatment.And the fact that so many varied
ailments are cured by a course of these mineral waters with enforced
dietetic regulations only shows the prevalence of gastro-duodenal
catarrhs and their relation to a great variety of human ailments.To a
certain extent the potassio-tartrate of sodium and other saline
laxatives may take the place of these waters if perseveringly used and
taken in the same way.In feebler subjects minute doses of strychnia or
some of the simple vegetable bitters may be used in conjunction with
the laxative salines.In chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastric mucous membrane,
which frequently follow acute attacks, the protracted use of hot water
is often followed by excellent results.There can be no doubt of the
value {478} of hot water in subacute inflammation of mucous membranes
in any locality; and it is specially valuable in gastro-intestinal
catarrh associated with lithaemia.Hot water, laxative salines,
combined with restricted diet and healthful regimen, accomplish much in
correcting morbid conditions of primary assimilation; and by
accomplishing this many secondary ailments promptly disappear.A pint
of water, hot as the patient can drink it, should be taken on an empty
stomach on first rising in the morning, and it may be repeated again an
hour before each meal and at bedtime.A few grains of the bicarbonate
of sodium and a little table-salt may be added.In some cases three or
four drops of tincture of nux vomica or some of the simple bitters may
be taken at the same time with benefit.Alkaline bitters are natural to
the upper portion of the digestive track.No food should be taken for a
half hour or an hour after the hot water.This treatment, to be
effective, must be persevered in for a length of time.A most rigid
system of dietetics suited to individual cases should be enforced at
the same time.In irritable and morbidly sensitive conditions of the mucous membrane
the sedative plan of treatment is not unfrequently followed by good
results; and of remedies belonging to this class bismuth is the most
effective.It is specially indicated in the more irritable forms of
gastric disturbance in which there is a sense of uneasiness and pain at
the epigastrium after taking food.If there is much acidity present, it
may be combined with magnesia or a few grains of finely-pulverized
animal charcoal.Chronic cases of long-continued inflammatory action, with intestinal
complication, are often much benefited by the use of mercurials in
small doses.The one-fifth of a grain of calomel, combined with bismuth
or the bicarbonate of sodium, may be given for weeks without danger of
salivation.In small
doses calomel is undoubtedly sedative to the mucous membrane of the
upper portion of the digestive track.In cases of long standing that
have resisted other modes of treatment the more direct astringents have
been found of great value.Of these, nitrate of silver is to be
preferred, alike for its sedative, astringent, and alterative
properties.It may be given in pill form in from one-quarter to
one-grain doses, combined with opium, a half hour before each meal.The
writer of this article can speak from much experience of the value of
this drug.It proves in many cases a valuable addition to the hot-water
and dietetic course already alluded to.If large quantities of mucus are vomited from time to time, especially
in the morning, we may resort with benefit to the use of other
astringents, such as bismuth, oxalate of cerium, kino, and opium; and
if we have reason to suspect stricture of the pylorus in connection
with a catarrhal condition of the mucous membrane, the stomach-pump
gives the patient great relief.It should be used about three hours
after a meal, injecting tepid water, and then reversing the syringe
until the water comes out perfectly clear.Niemeyer speaks highly of it
in such cases.He says: "Even the first application of the pump
generally gives the patients such relief that, so far from dreading a
repetition of this by no means pleasant operation, they clamorously beg
for it."The gastric catarrh of phthisis is difficult to relieve.Artificial
digestives may be tried, with dilute muriatic acid, as already
indicated; and {479} for the relief of pain and irritation there is no
remedy so efficacious as hydrocyanic acid, which may be combined with
bismuth and opium in case there is diarrhoea.Hot water may be also
tried, with restricted animal food.Habitual constipation must be overcome by suitable laxatives and by
enemata.Castor oil is mild and efficient in these cases, or in cases
of unusual torpor of the muscular coat of the bowels small doses of
aloes and strychnia may be tried.The free use of diluents toward the
close of digestion favors free action of the bowels.All harsh and
irritating cathartics are to be carefully avoided.When there is much tenderness of the epigastrium, benefit may be
derived from counter-irritation, and nothing is so effectual as the
repeated application of small blisters.General hygienic measures are in all cases to be insisted upon.In
morbid conditions of the liver and the upper portion of the digestive
track the free supply of oxygen to the lungs is a remedy of much power.Hence patients should live as much as possible in the open air.They
should be warmly clad, and, if not too feeble, frequent cold baths
should be resorted to.After local irritation has been subdued by appropriate treatment,
tonics may be tried to counteract the enfeebled state of the stomach.They are such as are appropriate for functional diseases of the
stomach.But they should be used with caution and judgment in irritable
and inflammatory forms of dyspepsia.If we attempt to force an appetite
by their use, and to crowd upon the stomach more food than it has
capacity to digest, we may intensify the trouble and thereby add to the
patient's general debility.Food and tonics fail to impart strength
because the stomach is not in a condition to digest them.One thing should be mentioned, in conclusion, as an important item in
the treatment--namely, patience.Chronic gastric catarrh, it should be
remembered, is essentially a chronic disease, and time becomes an
important element in its cure.{480}

SIMPLE ULCER OF THE STOMACH.BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.DEFINITION.--Simple ulcer of the stomach is usually round or oval.When
of recent formation it has smooth, clean-cut, or rounded borders,
without evidence of acute inflammation in its floor or in its borders.When of long duration it usually has thickened and indurated margins.The formation of the ulcer is usually attributed, in part at least, to
a disturbance in nutrition and to a subsequent solution by the gastric
juice of a circumscribed part of the wall of the stomach.The ulcer may
be latent in its course, but it is generally characterized by one or
more of the following symptoms: pain, vomiting, dyspepsia, hemorrhage
from the stomach, and loss of flesh and strength.It ends frequently in
recovery, but it may end in death by perforation of the stomach, by
hemorrhage, or by gradual exhaustion.SYNONYMS.--The following epithets have been employed to designate this
form of ulcer: simple, chronic, round, perforating, corrosive,
digestive, peptic; ulcus ventriculi simplex, s. chronicum, s. rotundum,
s. perforans, s. corrosivum, s. ex digestione, s. pepticum.HISTORY.--It is only since the description of gastric ulcer by
Cruveilhier in the year 1830 that especial attention has been paid to
this disease.In the writings of the ancients only vague and doubtful references to
ulcer of the stomach are found (Galen, Celsus).It is probable that
cases of this disease were described under such names as passio
cardiaca, gastrodynia, haematemesis, and melaena.After the revival of medicine in the sixteenth century, as post-mortem
examination of human bodies was made with greater frequency, the
existence of ulcers and of cicatrices in the stomach could not escape
attention.But only isolated and curious observations of gastric ulcer
are recorded up to near the end of the eighteenth century.One of the
earliest recorded unmistakable cases of perforating ulcer was observed
by John Bauhin, and is described in the _Sepulchretum_ of Bonetus,
published in 1679.Other cases belonging to this period were described
by Donatus, Courtial, Littre, Schenck, and Margagni.[1]

[Footnote 1: References to these and to other cases may be found in
Lebert's _Krankheiten des Magens_, Tubingen, 1878, p.180 _et seq._]

To Matthew Baillie unquestionably belongs the credit of having first
accurately described, in 1793, the anatomical peculiarities of simple
gastric ulcer.[2] At a later date he published three good engravings of
{481} this disease.[3] Baillie's concise and admirable description of
the morbid anatomy of gastric ulcer was unaccompanied by clinical data,
and seems to have had little or no influence in directing increased
attention to this disease.[Footnote 2: _The Morbid Anatomy of Some of the Most Important Parts of
the Human Body_, London, 1793, p.[Footnote 3: _A Series of Engravings, accompanied with Explanations,
etc._, London, 1799.]A valuable account of the symptoms of gastric ulcer was given by John
Abercrombie in 1824.[4] Nearly all of the symptoms now recognized as
belonging to this affection may be found in his article.He knew the
latent causes of the disease, the great diversity of symptoms in
different cases, and the modes of death by hemorrhage, by perforation,
and by asthenia.He regarded ulcer simply as a localized chronic
inflammation of the stomach, and did not distinguish carefully between
simple and cancerous ulceration.[Footnote 4: "Contributions to the Pathology of the Stomach, the
Pancreas, and the Spleen," _Edinburgh Med.See also, by the same author, _Pathological and
Practical Researches on Diseases of the Stomach, etc._--an excellent
work which passed through several editions.]Cruveilhier,[5] in the first volume of his great work on _Pathological
Anatomy_, published between the years 1829 and 1835, for the first time
clearly distinguished ulcer of the stomach from cancer of the stomach
and from ordinary gastritis.He gave an authoritative and full
description of gastric ulcer from the anatomical, the clinical, and the
therapeutical points of view.[Footnote 5: J. Cruveilhier, _Anatomie pathologique du Corps humain_,
tome i., Paris, 1829-35, livr.; and tome ii., Paris,
1835-42, livr.Next to Cruveilhier, Rokitansky has had the greatest influence upon the
modern conception of gastric ulcer.In 1839 this pathologist gave a
description of the disease based upon an analysis of 79 cases.[6] The
anatomical part of his description has served as the model for all
subsequent writers upon this subject.[Footnote 6: Rokitansky, _Oesterreich.Jahrb._, 1839, Bd.(abstract in _Schmidt's Jahrb._, Bd.Since the ushering in by Cruveilhier and by Rokitansky of the modern
era in the history of gastric ulcer, medical literature abounds in
articles upon this disease.But it cannot be said that the importance
of these works is at all commensurate with their number or that they
have added very materially to the classical descriptions given by
Cruveilhier and by Rokitansky.Perhaps most worthy of mention of the
works of this later era are the article by Jaksch relating to
symptomatology and diagnosis, that of Virchow pertaining to etiology,
the statistical analyses by Brinton, and the contributions to the
treatment of the disease by Ziemssen and by Leube.[7] In 1860, Ludwig
Muller published an extensive monograph upon gastric ulcer.[8]

frequency of simple gastric ulcer.The method usually adopted is to
observe the number of cases in which open ulcers and cicatrices are
found {482} in the stomach in a large number of autopsies.But this
method is open to two objections.The first objection is, that scars in
the stomach, particularly if they are small, are liable to be
overlooked or not to be noted in the record of the autopsy unless
special attention is directed to their search.The second objection is,
that it is not proven that all of the cicatrices found in the stomach
are the scars of healed simple ulcers, and that, in fact, it is
probable that many are not.In consequence of these defects (and others
might be mentioned) this method is of very limited value, although it
is perhaps the best which we have at our disposal.In 32,052 autopsies made in Prague, Berlin, Dresden, Erlangen, and
Kiel,[9] there were found 1522 cases of open ulcer or of cicatrix in
the stomach.If all the scars be reckoned as healed ulcers, according
to these statistics gastric ulcer, either cicatrized or open, is found
in about 5 per cent.[Footnote 9: The Prague statistics embrace 11,888 autopsies, compiled
from the following sources: 1, Jaksch, _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vol.; 2, Dittrich, _ibid._, vols.vii., viii., ix., x., xii., xiv.; 3,
Willigk, _ibid._, vol.; 4, Eppinger, _ibid._, vol.The Berlin statistics are to be found in dissertations by Plange
(abstract in _Virchow's Archiv_, vol.), by Steiner, and by
Wollmann (abstracts in _Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1868), and
by Berthold (1883).The Dresden statistics are in a dissertation by Stachelhausen
(Wurzburg, 1874), referred to by Birch-Hirschfeld, _Lehrb.837, Leipzig, 1877.The Erlangen statistics are reported by Ziemssen in _Volkmann's Samml.The Kiel report is in an inaugural dissertation by Greiss (Kiel, 1879),
referred to in the _Deutsche med.So far as possible, duodenal ulcers have been excluded.Only those
reports have been admitted which include both open ulcers and
cicatrices.]It is important to note the relative frequency of open ulcers as
compared with that of cicatrices.In 11,888 bodies examined in Prague,
there were found 164, or 1.4 per cent., with open ulcers, and 373, or
3.1 per cent., with cicatrices.Here scars were found about two and
one-fourth times as frequently as open ulcers.The observations of
Grunfeld in Copenhagen show that when especial attention is given to
searching for cicatrices in the stomach, they are found much more
frequently than the figures here given would indicate.[10] It would be
a moderate estimate to place the ratio of cicatrices to open ulcers at
3 to 1.[Footnote 10: Grunfeld (abstract in _Schmidt's Jahrb._, Bd.141, 1883) in 1150 autopsies found 124 cicatrices in the stomach, or 11
per cent., but in only 450 of these cases was his attention especially
directed to their search, and in these he found 92 cases, or 20 per
cent., with scars.Grunfeld's statistics relate only to persons over
fifty years of age.Gastric ulcer, moreover, is extraordinarily common
in Copenhagen.The inexact nature of the ordinary statistics relating to cicatrices is
also evident from the fact that in the four collections of cases which
comprise the Prague statistics the percentage of open ulcers varies
only between 0.81 and 2.44, while the percentage of cicatrices varies
between 0.89 and 5.42.]The statistics concerning the average frequency of open ulcers are much
more exact and trustworthy than those relating to cicatrices.It may be
considered reasonably certain that, at least in Europe, open gastric
ulcers are found on the average in from 1 to 2 per cent.[11]

[Footnote 11: If in this estimate were included infants dying during
the first days of life, the percentage would be much smaller.]It is manifestly impossible to form an accurate estimate of the
frequency of gastric ulcer from the number of cases diagnosed as such
{483} during life, because the diagnosis is in many cases uncertain.Nevertheless, estimates upon this basis have practical clinical value.In 41,688 cases constituting the clinical material of Lebert[12] in
Zurich and in Breslau between the years 1853 and 1873, the diagnosis of
gastric ulcer was made in 252 cases, or about 2/3 per cent.[Footnote 12: Lebert, _op.Of 1699 cases of gastric ulcer collected from various hospital
statistics[13] and examined post-mortem, 692, or 40 per cent., were in
males, and 1007, or 60 per cent., were in females.The result of this
analysis makes the ratio 2 males to 3 females.[Footnote 13: These statistics include the previously-cited Prague,
Berlin, Dresden, and Erlangen cases so far as the sex is given, and in
addition the returns of Rokitansky, _op.cit._; Starcke (Jena),
_Deutsche Klinik_, 1870, Nos.26-29; Lebert, _op.cit._; Chambers,
_London Journ.of Med._, July, 1852; Habershon, _Dis.of the Abdomen_,
3d ed.Soc._, 1880; and the Munich
Hospital, _Annalen d. stadt.Only series of cases from the post-examinations of a number of years
have been admitted.It is an error to include isolated cases from
journals, as Brinton has done, because an undue number of these are
cases of perforation, which is a more common event in females than in
males.Thus, of 43 cases of gastric ulcer presented to the London
Pathological Society since its foundation up to 1882, 19, or 44 per
cent., were cases of perforation.In my cases are included a few
duodenal ulcers not easily separated from the gastric ulcers in the
compilation.]In order to determine from post-mortem records the age at which gastric
ulcer most frequently occurs, all cases in which only cicatrices are
found should be excluded, because a cicatrix gives no evidence as to
the age at which the ulcer existed.The following table gives the age in 607 cases of open ulcer collected
from hospital statistics[14] (post-mortem material):

    Age.----------+---------------+--------

  ----------+---------------+--------

From this table it is apparent that three-fourths of the cases are
found between the ages of twenty and sixty, and that the cases are
distributed with tolerable uniformity between these four decades.The
largest number of cases is found between twenty and thirty.The
frequency of gastric ulcer after sixty years diminishes, although it
remains quite considerable, especially in view of the comparatively
small number of those living after that period.[Footnote 14: The sources of these statistics are the same as those of
the statistics relating to sex in the preceding foot-note.The age in
the Erlangen cases of open ulcer is given by Hauser (_Das chronische
Magengeschwur_, p.It is evident that only about
two-fifths of the cases could be utilized, partly because in some the
age was not stated, but mainly on account of the necessity of excluding
scars--a self-evident precaution which Brinton did not take.]The probability that many cases of ulcer included in the above table
existed for several years before death makes it desirable that
estimates as to the occurrence of the disease at different ages should
be made also from cases carefully diagnosed during life, although the
diagnosis must necessarily be less certain than that in the post-mortem
records.The best {484} statistics of this character which we possess
are those of Lebert, from whose work the following table has been
compiled:

Lebert_.----------+---------------+---------+----------

Of these cases, nearly seven-tenths were between twenty and forty years
of age--a preponderance sufficiently great to be of diagnostic
value.[16]

[Footnote 15: _Op.Of these cases, 19 were fatal, and
the diagnosis was confirmed after death.All of the cases were studied
by Lebert in hospitals in Zurich and Breslau.][Footnote 16: In my opinion, clinical experience is more valuable than
are post-mortem records in determining the age at which gastric ulcer
most frequently develops.In support of this opinion are the following
facts: In many cases no positive conclusions as to the age of the ulcer
can be drawn from the post-mortem appearances, and sufficient clinical
history is often wanting; a considerable proportion of the cases of
gastric ulcer do not terminate fatally with the first attack, but are
subject to relapses which may prove fatal in advanced life; in most
general hospitals the number of patients in advanced life is relatively
in excess of those in youth and middle age.By his faulty method of
investigating this question, Brinton came to the erroneous conclusion
that the liability to gastric ulcer is greatest in old age--a
conclusion which is opposed to clinical experience.]The oldest case on record is the one mentioned by Eppinger,[17] of an
old beggar whose age is stated at one hundred and twenty years.[Footnote 17: _Prager Vierteljahrschrift_, Bd.The occurrence of simple ulcer of the stomach under ten years of age is
extremely rare.Rokitansky, with his enormous experience, said that he
had never seen a case under fourteen years.[18] There are recorded,
however, a number of cases of gastric ulcer in infancy and childhood,
but there is doubt as to how many of these are genuine examples of
simple ulcer.Rehn in 1874 analyzed a number, although by no means all,
of the reputed cases, and found only six, or at the most seven, which
would stand criticism.[19] The age in these seven cases varied between
seven days and thirteen years.In one case (Donne) a cicatrix was found
in the stomach of a child three years old.Since the publication of
Rehn's article at least four apparently genuine cases have been
reported--namely, one by Reimer in a child three and a half years old;
one by Goodhart in an infant thirty hours after birth; one by Eross in
a girl twelve years old suffering from acute miliary tuberculosis, in
whom the ulcer perforated into the omental sac; and one by Malinowski
in a girl ten years of age.[20]

{485} the male than in the female.This is apparent from the following

In males the largest number of cases is found between thirty and forty
years, and in females between twenty and thirty.In males 54-1/2 per
cent.of the cases occur after forty years of age, and in females 48.9
per cent.[Footnote 21: These cases are obtained from the same sources as those
of the first table (page 483).]The relation between age and perforation of gastric ulcer will be
discussed in connection with this symptom.The conclusions concerning the age of occurrence of gastric ulcer may
be recapitulated as follows: Simple ulcer of the stomach most
frequently develops in the female between twenty and thirty, and in the
male between thirty and forty.At the post-mortem table it is found
with almost equal frequency in the four decades between twenty and
sixty, but clinically it appears with greatly diminished frequency
after forty years of age.In infancy and early childhood simple ulcer
of the stomach is a curiosity.We have no positive information as to the influence of climate upon the
production of gastric ulcer.The disease seems to be somewhat unequal
in its geographical distribution, but the data bearing upon this point
are altogether insufficient.According to the returns of Dahlerup and of Grunfeld, gastric ulcer is
unusually common in Copenhagen.[22] According to Starcke's
report[23]--which, however, is not based upon a large number of
cases--the percentage is also unusually high in Jena.Sperk says that
gastric ulcer is very common in Eastern Siberia.[24] Palgrave gives a
high percentage of its occurrence in Arabia.[25] The disease is less
common in France than in England or in Germany,[26] and in general
appears to be more common in northern than in southern countries.The
statement of DaCosta[27] coincides with my own impression that gastric
ulcer is less common in this country than in England or in Germany.I
have found 6 cases of open ulcer of the stomach in about 800 autopsies
made by me in New York.[Footnote 22: Dahlerup in Copenhagen (abstract in _Canstatt's
Jahresbericht_, 1842) found 26 cases in 200 autopsies (13 per cent.)made in the course of a year and a half.cit._) found
124 cicatrices in 1150 autopsies (11 per cent.).]cit._) found 39 cases in 384 autopsies (10
per cent.also Muller, _Jenaische Zeitschr._, v.[Footnote 24: _Deutsche Klinik_, 1867.][Footnote 25: _Narrative of a Year's Journey through Central and
Eastern Arabia_, London, 1865.][Footnote 26: Laveran and Teissier, _Nouveaux Elements de Path.1060, Paris, 1879; and Godin, _Essai sur

expresses the same opinion in the _Proc.In 444,564 deaths in New York City from 1868 to 1882, inclusive, ulcer
of the stomach was assigned as the cause of death only in 410 cases.Little value can be assigned to these statistics as regards a disease
so difficult of diagnosis.]{486} Gastric ulcer is more common among the poor than among the rich.Anxiety, mental depression, scanty food, damp dwellings, insufficient
exercise, and exposure to extreme cold are among the depressing
influences which have been assigned as predisposing causes of gastric
ulcer, but without sufficient proof.The comparative frequency of gastric ulcer among needlewomen,
maidservants, and female cooks has attracted the attention of all who
have had large opportunity for clinical observation.Pressure upon the pit of the stomach, either by wearing tight belts or
in the pursuit of certain occupations, such as those of shoemaking, of
tailoring, and of weaving, is thought by Habershon and others to
predispose to ulcer of the stomach.[28]

[Footnote 28: Bernutz found gastric ulcer in a turner in porcelain, and
learned that other workmen in the same factory had vomited blood.He
thinks that in this and in similar occupations heavy particles of dust
collecting in the mouth and throat may be swallowed with the saliva,
and by their irritation cause gastric ulcer (_Gaz.des Hopitaux_, June
18, 1881).]Vomiting of blood has been known in several instances to affect a
number of members of the same family, but beyond this unsatisfactory
evidence there is nothing to show hereditary influence in the origin of
gastric ulcer.In a few cases injury of the region of the stomach, as by a fall or a
blow, has been assigned as the cause of ulcer.The efficacy of this
cause has been accepted by Gerhardt,[29] Lebert, Ziemssen, and others.In many of the cases in which this cause has been assigned the symptoms
of ulcer appeared so long after the injury that it is doubtful whether
there was any connection between the two.[Footnote 29: "Zur Aetiologie u. Therapie d. runden Magengeschwurz,"
_Wiener med.That loss of substance in the mucous membrane of the stomach may be the
result of injury directly or indirectly applied to this organ cannot
admit of question.But it is characteristic of these traumatic ulcers
that they rapidly heal unless the injury is so severe as to prove
speedily fatal.Thus, Duplay[30] relates three cases in which pain,
vomiting, repeated vomiting of blood, and dyspepsia followed contusions
of the region of the stomach.But these traumatic cases, which for a
time gave the symptoms of gastric ulcer, recovered in from two weeks to
two months, whereas the persistence of the symptoms is a characteristic
of simple ulcer.[31]

[Footnote 30: "Contusions de l'Estomac," _Arch.de Med._, Sept.,
1881.][Footnote 31: In a case reported by Potain, however, the symptoms of
ulcer appeared immediately after injury to the stomach, and continued
up to the time of death (_Gaz.In the same way, ulcers of the stomach produced by corrosive poisons as
a rule soon cicatrize, unless death follows after a short time the
action of the poison.That corrosive ulcers may, however, be closely
allied to simple ulcers is shown by an interesting case reported by
Wilson Fox,[32] in which the immediate effects of swallowing
hydrochloric acid were recovered from in about four days, but death
resulted from vomiting of blood two weeks after.At the autopsy the
source of the hemorrhage was found in an ulcer of the pyloric region of
the stomach.[33] A
boy who suffered severely for three or four days after drinking some
strong mineral acid recovered, so that he {487} ate and drank as usual.Two months afterward he died suddenly from perforation of a gastric
ulcer.[Footnote 33: _The Lancet_, April 9, 1842.]While, then, it would be a great error to identify traumatic and
corrosive ulcers of the stomach with simple ulcer, it is possible that
either may become chronic if associated with those conditions of the
stomach or of the constitution, for the most part unknown to us, which
prevent the ready healing of simple ulcer.Gastric ulcer is often associated with other diseases, but it occurs
also uncomplicated in a large number of cases.Most of the diseases
with which it has been found associated are to be regarded simply as
coincident or complicating affections; but as some of them have been
thought to cause the ulcer, they demand consideration in this
connection.The large share taken by pulmonary phthisis in deaths from all causes
renders this disease a frequent associate of gastric ulcer.It is
probable that the lowered vitality of phthisical patients increases
somewhat their liability to gastric ulcer.Moreover, it would not be
strange if gastric ulcer, as well as other exhausting diseases, such as
diabetes and cancer, diminished the power of resisting tuberculous
infection.Genuine tuberculous ulcers occur rarely in the stomach, but
they are not to be identified with simple ulcer.There is no proof that amenorrhoea or other disorders of menstruation
exert any direct influence in the production of gastric ulcer, although
Crisp went so far as to designate certain cases of gastric ulcer as the
menstrual ulcer.[34] Nevertheless, amenorrhoea is a very common symptom
or associated condition in the gastric ulcer of females between sixteen
and thirty years of age.[Footnote 34: _The Lancet_, Aug.Chlorosis and anaemia, especially in young women, favor the development
of gastric ulcer, but that there is no necessary relation between the
two is shown by the occurrence of ulcer in those previously robust.Moreover, it is probable that in some cases in which the anaemia has
been thought to precede the ulcer it has, in fact, been a result rather
than a cause of the ulcer.Especial interest attaches to the relation between gastric ulcer and
diseases of the heart and of the blood-vessels, because to disturbances
in the circulation in the stomach the largest share in the
pathenogenesis of ulcer has been assigned by Virchow.As might be
expected, valvular lesions of the heart and atheroma of the arteries
are not infrequently found in elderly people who are the subjects of
gastric ulcer.A small proportion of cases of ulcer has been associated
also with other diseases in which the arteries are often abnormal, such
as with chronic diffuse nephritis, syphilis, amyloid degeneration, and
endarteritis obliterans.But, after making the most generous allowance
for the influence of these diseases in the causation of ulcer of the
stomach, there remains a large number of cases of ulcer in which no
disease of the heart or of the arteries has been found.[35] Gastric
ulcer develops most frequently between fifteen and forty years of age,
a period when arterial diseases are not common.Changes in the {488}
blood-vessels of the stomach will be described in connection with the
morbid anatomy of gastric ulcer.[Footnote 35: From Berlin are reported the largest number of cases of
gastric ulcer associated with diseases of the circulatory apparatus;
thus, by Berthold 170 out of 294 cases, and by Steiner 71 out of 110
cases of ulcer.Endocarditis and arterial atheroma (present in
one-third of Berthold's cases of ulcer) form the largest proportion of
these diseases.]Chronic passive congestion of the stomach in cases of cirrhosis of the
liver, direct injury to the mucous membrane of the stomach by parasites
in trichinosis, hemorrhage into the coats of the stomach in scorbutus
and in dementia paralytica, persistent vomiting in pregnancy, and
anaemia induced by prolonged lactation, have each been assigned as
causes in a few cases of gastric ulcer, but they are not associated
with gastric ulcer in enough cases to make their causative influence at
all certain.Galliard assigns diabetes mellitus as the cause in one case of gastric
ulcer.[36]

[Footnote 36: _Clin.de la Pitie_, Paris, 1877, p.Rokitansky attributed some cases of gastric ulcer to intermittent
fever.Those who believe in the inflammatory origin of ulcer of the stomach
think that chronic gastritis is an important predisposing cause.The abuse of alcohol is admitted as an indirect cause of gastric ulcer
by the majority of writers.Lastly, burns of the skin, which are an important factor in the
etiology of duodenal ulcers, have been followed only in a very few
instances by ulcer of the stomach.The direct causes of ulcer of the stomach, concerning which our
positive knowledge is very limited, will be considered under the
pathenogenesis of the disease.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The following classes of cases of gastric ulcer may be
distinguished:

First: Gastric ulcer may give rise to no symptoms pointing to its
existence, and be found accidentally at the autopsy when death has
occurred from some other disease.This latent course is most frequent
with gastric ulcers complicating chronic wasting diseases, such as
tuberculosis, and with gastric ulcers in elderly people.Second: Gastric ulcer may give rise to no marked symptoms before
profuse hemorrhage from the stomach or perforation of the stomach,
resulting speedily in death, occurs.Acute ulcers in anaemic females
from fifteen to thirty years of age are those most liable to perforate
without previous symptoms.Third: Gastric ulcer may occasion only the symptoms of chronic
gastritis, or of functional dyspepsia, or of purely nervous gastralgia,
so that its diagnosis is impossible.In this class of cases after a
time characteristic symptoms may develop.Here, too, sudden death may
occur from hemorrhage or from perforation.Fourth: In typical cases characteristic symptoms are present, so that
the diagnosis can be made more or less positively.These symptoms are
pain, and hemorrhage from the stomach, associated usually with vomiting
and disturbances of digestion.The different symptoms of gastric ulcer will now be described.Of all the symptoms, pain is the most constant and is often the first
to attract attention.It is absent throughout the disease only in
exceptional cases.In different cases, and often in the same case at
different times, the pain varies in its quality, its intensity, its
situation, its duration, and in other characteristics.The kind of pain which is most characteristic of gastric ulcer is
severe {489} paroxysmal pain strictly localized in a circumscribed spot
in the epigastrium, coming on soon after eating, and disappearing as
soon as the stomach is relieved of its contents.More common, although less characteristic, than the strictly localized
pain are paroxysms of severe pain, usually called cardialgic[37] or
gastralgic, diffused over the epigastrium and often spreading into the
surrounding regions.This is like the neuralgic pain of nervous
gastralgia, which is not infrequent in chlorotic and hysterical
females.The pain may be so intense as to induce syncope, or even
convulsions, in very sensitive patients.[Footnote 37: There is much confusion as to the meaning of the term
cardialgia.With most English and American writers it signifies
heartburn, while continental writers understand by cardialgia the
severe paroxysms of epigastric pain which we more frequently call
gastralgia.]The strictly localized pain is probably caused by direct irritation
confined to the nerves in the floor of the ulcer.In the diffuse
gastralgic attacks the irritation radiates or is reflected to the
neighboring nerves, and sometimes to those at a distance.In most cases of gastric ulcer localized epigastric pain and diffuse
gastralgic paroxysms are combined.The painful sense of oppression and fulness in the epigastrium which is
felt in many cases of gastric ulcer after eating is simply a dyspeptic
symptom, and is probably referable to an associated chronic catarrhal
gastritis.This dyspeptic pain is of little value in diagnosis.Most subjects of gastric ulcer feel in the intervals between the
paroxysms a more or less constant dull pain, or it may be only a sense
of uneasiness, in the epigastrium.When sharp epigastric pain is felt
continuously, it is usually inferred that the ulcer has extended to the
peritoneum and has caused a circumscribed peritonitis, but this
inference is not altogether trustworthy.The quality of the pain caused by gastric ulcer is described variously
as burning, gnawing, boring, less frequently as lancinating.More important than the quality is the situation of the pain.The
situation of the localized pain is usually at or a little below the
ensiform cartilage.It may, however, be felt as low as the umbilicus or
it may deviate to the hypochondria.In addition to pain in the
epigastrium (point epigastrique), Cruveilhier called attention to the
frequent presence of pain in the dorsal region (point rachidien).The
dorsal pain, which may be more severe than the epigastric, is sometimes
interscapular, and sometimes corresponds to the lowest dorsal or to the
upper lumbar vertebrae.It is usually a little to the left of the
spine.The pain is often described as extending from the pit of the
stomach through to the back.According to Brinton, the situation of the localized pain gives a clue
to the situation of the ulcer, pain near the left border of the
ensiform cartilage indicating ulcer near the cardiac orifice, pain in
the median line and to the right of this indicating ulcer of the
pyloric region, and pain in the left hypochondrium indicating ulcer of
the fundus.It does not often happen that the pain remains so sharply
localized as to make possible this diagnosis, even if the situation of
the pain were a safe guide.Of the various circumstances which influence the severity of the pain
in gastric ulcer, the most important is the effect of food.Pain
usually {490} comes on within a few minutes to half an hour after
taking food, although it may appear immediately after ingestion or be
delayed for an hour or more.The pain continues until the stomach is
relieved of its contents by vomiting or by their passage into the
duodenum.It is unsafe to attempt to diagnose the position of the ulcer
merely from the length of time which elapses between the ingestion of
food and the onset of pain.It has sometimes been noticed that as
improvement progresses pain comes on later and later after eating.As
might naturally be expected, coarse, indigestible,
imperfectly-masticated food, sour and spirituous liquids, and hot
substances are more irritating than bland articles of diet.In some
exceptional cases the ingestion of even coarse food, instead of
aggravating, has had no effect upon the pain, or at least for the time
being has even relieved it.External pressure usually increases the intensity of the pain of
gastric ulcer; in rare instances pressure relieves the pain.Rest and the recumbent posture as a rule alleviate the pain of ulcer of
the stomach.The position of the patient may affect the severity of the
pain in a more striking way.It may naturally be supposed that that
posture is most agreeable which removes from the ulcer the weight of
the food during digestion.Hence it was claimed by Osborne[38] that the
site of the ulcer could often be inferred from the effect of posture on
the pain.Thus, relief in the prone position would indicate ulcer of
the posterior wall; relief in the supine position, ulcer of the
anterior wall; relief on the left or on the right side, ulcer of the
pyloric or of the cardiac region respectively.As ulcer of the
posterior wall is the most frequent, relief should be obtained oftener
by bending forward or by lying on the face than in the supine position.Experience has shown that the influence of posture on the pain is not a
safe guide in diagnosing the location of the ulcer.[Footnote 38: Jonathan Osborne, _Dublin Journal of Medical Science_,
vol.Mental emotions--particularly anxiety and anger--fatigue, even moderate
exercise, exposure to cold, and the menstrual molimen may each cause
exacerbations of pain in some cases of gastric ulcer.Tenderness on pressure is a common symptom of gastric ulcer.A
localized point of tenderness may be discovered even when the
subjective pain is not localized.Pain sometimes follows pressure not
immediately, but after a brief interval.A fixed point of tenderness
can often be determined when the stomach is empty more accurately than
when it is full.The tender spot can sometimes be covered by the
finger's end.In searching for a point of tenderness it should be
remembered that many persons are very sensitive to pressure in the
epigastrium, and also that pressure is not without danger to those who
are the subjects of gastric ulcer.Not only may pressure induce
paroxysms of pain, but it may cause even rupture of the ulcerated walls
of the stomach.[39] Hence pressure should be cautiously employed and
should not be often repeated.[Footnote 39: Dalton has reported a case in which perforation of a
gastric ulcer occurred while the patient was subjected in a water-cure
establishment to kneading of the abdomen to relieve his flatulence
(_Trans.In some cases of gastric ulcer pain is felt in regions at a distance
from the stomach.The most frequent of these so-called radiation
neuralgias are--neuralgia of the lower intercostal spaces, combined
sometimes with {491} hyperaesthesia or with analgesia of the affected
region, pain in the right shoulder (perhaps due to adhesions between
the stomach and the liver or the diaphragm), pain in the left shoulder,
and pain in the loins.In a case of ulcer reported by Traube
terminating in perforation the sole complaint, besides loss of appetite
and retching, had been difficulty in breathing and oppression in the
chest.These symptoms, which may be combined with gastralgic paroxysms,
are referred by Traube to transference of the irritation from the
gastric to the pulmonary filaments of the pneumogastric nerve.[40]

[Footnote 40: _Deutsche Klinik_, 1861, No.These symptoms evidently
correspond to the vagus neurosis described by Rosenbach, in which, as
the result of reflex irritation of the pneumogastric nerve in the
stomach, occur difficulty in breathing, oppression in the chest,
palpitation, arhythmical action of the heart, and epigastric pulsation
(_Deutsche med.Wochenschr._, 1879, Nos.Sometimes the pain of gastric ulcer intermits for days or even weeks.When the intermission is of considerable duration it is probable that
cicatrization has been in progress.It should, however, be remembered
that gastralgic attacks may continue even after cicatrization of the
ulcer is completed, probably in consequence of compression of
nerve-filaments by the cicatricial tissue.Once in a while the pain
exhibits a marked periodicity in its appearance.Thus in a case of
ulcer ending fatally from hemorrhage the pain came on but once a day,
and that with considerable regularity at the same hour.In this case
the pain was relieved by taking food.[41] The pain of gastric ulcer may
be temporarily relieved by hemorrhage from the stomach, and perhaps by
division of the irritated nerve by sloughing (Habershon).[Footnote 41: Case reported by Peacock, _Rep.The causes of the pain of gastric ulcer are not far to seek.Foremost
is the irritation of nerve-filaments exposed by the ulcerative process.The irritation may be by mechanical, chemical, or thermic agencies.With our present imperfect knowledge it is profitless to discuss
whether the pneumogastric or the sympathetic nerves are the chief
carriers of the abnormal sensations.[42] In the next place, we may have
radiation of the irritation from these nerves to neighboring and even
to remote nerves.Furthermore, the extension of the inflammation to the
peritoneum and the surrounding parts, and the formation of adhesions,
are additional factors in some cases in causing pain.Finally, the
great differences in susceptibility to pain manifested by different
individuals is to be borne in mind.[Footnote 42: Leven, without sufficient reason, distinguishes two kinds
of gastralgic attacks--the one having its point of departure in the
pneumogastric, the other in the sympathetic nerve; in the former the
pain is associated with dyspnoea and palpitation of the heart; in the
latter the pain is deeper, and is accompanied by vaso-motor (?)troubles on one side of the body.]Next to pain, vomiting is the most frequent symptom of gastric ulcer.There is, however, little which is characteristic of ulcer in this
symptom, unless the vomited material contains blood.In some cases of
gastric ulcer vomiting is the most marked and most distressing symptom
of the disease.It may, however, be absent during the whole course of
gastric ulcer.Vomiting occurs most frequently after taking food, and is greatly
aggravated by an unregulated diet.Sometimes nearly everything which is
taken into the stomach is vomited.The vomiting of mucus or of a {492}
thin fluid unmixed with food is indicative only of chronic catarrhal
gastritis.Alimentary vomiting, which is more indicative of gastric
ulcer, usually occurs not immediately after taking food, but at the
acme of a gastralgic attack caused by the food.Soon after the stomach
is emptied by one or more acts of vomiting the pain is relieved.The
act of vomiting is usually easy, and at times is hardly more than
regurgitation of the food.Sometimes the patient experiences an
excessively sour taste from the vomit.Vomiting exhausts the patient by withdrawing nutriment, and when
persistent may even cause death from inanition.But in some cases of
gastric ulcer, especially in women, the vomiting seems to be mainly a
nervous symptom, and even when long continued may be attended by little
or no loss of flesh.Evidently, more food is retained in these cases
than might be supposed.There are two evident causes of vomiting in gastric ulcer--namely,
chronic catarrhal gastritis, which is a frequent complication, and
direct irritation of the nerves in the ulcer.Vomiting due to
dilatation of the stomach is oftener a sequel than an immediate symptom
of gastric ulcer.For the diagnosis of gastric ulcer hemorrhage from the stomach is the
most important symptom.The frequency of only the larger hemorrhages can be determined with any
degree of exactness.If the blood be effused in small quantity or
slowly, it may be discharged solely with the stools and escape
detection.Such slight hemorrhages doubtless occur in most cases of
gastric ulcer.It is probable that easily-recognized hemorrhages from
the stomach occur in about one-third of the cases of gastric ulcer.[43]
Hemorrhage is absent as a rule in the acute perforating ulcer of the
stomach.[Footnote 43: In consequence of the uncertainty of the diagnosis in
cases of gastric ulcer which recover without hemorrhage, the estimates
of the frequency of this symptom have a very limited value, and will
vary with different observers according to their standard of diagnosis
of this disease.Lebert observed gastric hemorrhage in four-fifths of
his carefully-studied cases, and in three-fifths of his cases there was
profuse haematemesis.Brinton estimates that the larger hemorrhages
occur in about one-third of the cases.Muller found them in one-fourth
of the cases which he analyzed.]In most cases hemorrhage from gastric ulcer is preceded by pain,
vomiting, and disturbances of digestion.Antecedent symptoms may,
however, be absent, or may be so obscure that no suspicion of ulcer
exists until the hemorrhage occurs.The hemorrhage may be slight, moderate, or excessive in amount
(Cruveilhier).The larger hemorrhages are those which are most
distinctive of gastric ulcer.The blood may be vomited, or voided with the stools, or retained in the
stomach and the intestines.As has been remarked, when the hemorrhage is scanty all the blood may
escape by the bowel.Sometimes, although much less frequently, blood
effused in large quantity is entirely evacuated with the stools.After
haematemesis more or less blood is discharged by the bowel, sometimes
for several days after the vomiting of blood has ceased.Blood which
has traversed the whole length of the intestinal canal acquires a tarry
consistence and a black or brownish color in consequence of the
production of dark-brown haematin by the action of the digestive juices
{493} upon the haemoglobin, and in consequence of the formation of
black sulphide of iron by the union of hydrogen sulphide in the lower
part of the intestine with the iron of the haematin.The passage of
these black viscid stools is called melaena.Inasmuch as we cannot
presume gastric hemorrhage to be absent simply because no blood has
been vomited, it is evidently important to examine the stools for blood
when the diagnosis of gastric ulcer is obscure, and also in cases of
gastric ulcer where there are symptoms of internal hemorrhage not
accounted for by blood vomited.It should be remembered that certain
drugs, particularly iron and bismuth, may blacken the feces.In very exceptional cases of gastric ulcer the effusion of a large
volume of blood causes sudden death before any of the blood has been
vomited.The autopsy shows the stomach and more or less of the small
intestine distended with coagulated blood.Hemorrhage from gastric ulcer is usually made manifest by the vomiting
of blood.The quantity of the vomited blood varies from mere traces to
several pounds.The color and the consistence of the blood depend upon
the quantity effused and the length of time that the blood has remained
in the stomach.Blood which has been acted upon by the gastric juice is
coagulated, has a grumous consistence, and acquires by the formation of
haematin out of haemoglobin a dark-brown color, often compared to that
of coffee-grounds.Blood effused in small quantity is usually vomited
only with the food, and has usually the coffee-grounds appearance.The
patient's condition is not appreciably influenced by this slight loss
of blood.A little blood expelled after repeated acts of vomiting has
no diagnostic importance.Vomiting usually occurs soon after a large
gastric hemorrhage.It is the mechanical distension of the stomach
rather than any irritating quality of the blood which causes the
vomiting.Blood which is rejected immediately after a large gastric
hemorrhage is alkaline, fluid, and of an arterial (rarely of a venous)
hue.Often, however, even with large hemorrhages, the blood remains
sufficiently long in the stomach to be partly coagulated and to be
darkened in color.Ulcer more frequently than any other disease of the
stomach causes the vomiting of unaltered blood in large quantity.But
this kind of haematemesis is not peculiar to simple ulcer.It may occur
in other diseases, such as gastric cancer, and coffee-ground vomiting
may be associated with ulcer.Copious haematemesis in cases of gastric ulcer appears usually without
premonition, or it may be preceded for a day or two by increased pain.Its occurrence is somewhat more common during the digestion of food
than in the intervals, but there have been cases of ulcer where the
bleeding was favored by an empty stomach and was checked by the
distension of the organ with food.The free use of stimulants and
violent physical or mental exertion may excite hemorrhage.With the
onset of the hemorrhage the patient experiences a sense of warmth and
of oppression at the epigastrium, followed by faintness, nausea, and
the vomiting of a large quantity of blood.An attack of syncope often
causes, at least temporarily, cessation of the hemorrhage.But the
thrombus which closes the eroded vessel may easily be washed away, so
that the hemorrhage often recurs and continues at intervals for several
days, thereby greatly increasing the danger to the patient.Thus, the
tendency is for {494} the hemorrhage from gastric ulcer to appear in
phases or periods occupying several days.A single hemorrhage is rarely so profuse as to cause immediate death.More frequently the patient dies after successive hemorrhages.In the
majority of cases the hemorrhage is not immediately dangerous to life,
but is followed by symptoms of anaemia, more or less profound according
to the strength of the patient and the amount of blood lost.Prostration and pallor follow the larger hemorrhages.Dizziness,
ringing in the ears, and dimness of vision appear when the patient
attempts to leave the recumbent posture.Thirst is often a marked
symptom.The pulse is feeble and more frequent than normal.There is
often a moderate elevation of temperature (anaemic fever) after profuse
hemorrhage.The urine is pale, abundant, and sometimes contains albumen
(Quincke).After a few days anaemic cardiac murmurs can often be heard.Under favorable circumstances these symptoms of anaemia disappear in
the course of a few weeks.The other symptoms of ulcer, particularly the pain, are sometimes
notably relieved, and may even disappear, after an abundant hemorrhage.They usually, however, return sooner or later.After a variable
interval one attack of haematemesis is likely to be followed by others.There is much diversity in different cases as regards the frequency of
these attacks and the character of the symptoms in the intervals.In a
few cases recovery follows a single attack of gastric hemorrhage; in
other cases the hemorrhage recurs frequently after intervals of only a
few days, weeks, or months; in still other cases hemorrhage recurs only
after long intervals, perhaps of years, although other symptoms of
ulcer continue.Sometimes the disappearance of symptoms indicates only
an apparent cure, and later the patient dies suddenly while in apparent
health by a profuse gastric hemorrhage.In the rare cases of this last
variety Cruveilhier has found sometimes that the ulcer has cicatrized
except just over the eroded blood-vessel.The sources of the hemorrhage in gastric ulcer will be described in
connection with the morbid anatomy.The symptoms of gastric indigestion are commonly, although not
constantly, present in gastric ulcer.They may constitute the sole
symptoms, in which case the diagnosis of the lesion is impossible.The
most important local symptoms of gastric dyspepsia are diminution, less
frequently perversion or increase, of the appetite; increased thirst;
during digestion, and sometimes independent of digestion, a feeling of
discomfort merely or of painful oppression, or even of sharp pain, in
the epigastrium; nausea; vomiting of undigested food, of mucus, and of
bile; regurgitation of thin fluids; often acid, sometimes neutral or
alkaline, flatulence, with belching of gas, and constipation.In many
cases of gastric ulcer the appetite is not disturbed, but the patient
refrains from eating on account of the pain caused by taking food.Among the so-called sympathetic symptoms of dyspepsia are headache,
dizziness, depression of spirits, oppression in the chest, and
irregularity of the heart's action.Dyspepsia contributes its share to
the production of the anaemia and of the loss of flesh and strength
which are present in some degree in most cases of chronic gastric
ulcer.{495} In many cases of acute perforating ulcer, as well as in some
cases of chronic ulcer, the symptoms are either absent or they are but
slightly marked.It has been demonstrated that in many cases of gastric
ulcer the resorptive power of the mucous membrane of the stomach is
unimpaired.[44]

[Footnote 44: This is shown by the experiments of Pentzoldt and Faber,
who determined the length of time which elapsed between swallowing
gelatin capsules containing iodide of potassium and the appearance of
the iodide in the saliva (_Berl.Quetsch observed rapid absorption from the stomach in two cases of
gastric ulcer (_ibid._, 1884, No.It is believed that also the
duration of the digestive process in the stomach is often within normal
limits in cases of gastric ulcer, although exact experiments upon this
point, as they require the use of the stomach-pump, have not been made
in this disease (Leube).]The most common cause of dyspepsia in gastric ulcer is the chronic
catarrhal gastritis which usually accompanies this disease.It is
probable that the movements of the stomach may be seriously interfered
with by destruction of the muscular coat of the stomach when the ulcer
is of considerable size and is seated in the pyloric region.Adhesions
of the stomach to surrounding parts may likewise impair the normal
movements of the stomach.It is possible that ulcers, especially those
which are very painful, may cause reflex disturbance of the peristaltic
movements of the stomach and alterations in the quality or the quantity
of the gastric juice.The serious digestive disturbances which are
caused by distortions and dilatation of the stomach resulting from
cicatricial contraction of gastric ulcer are not considered in this
article.Although Niemeyer emphasized the frequency in gastric ulcer of a
strikingly red tongue with smooth or furrowed surface, it does not
appear that any especial importance is to be attached to this or to any
other condition of the tongue as a symptom of the disease.Increased flow of saliva is a rare symptom, which, when it occurs, is
usually associated with dyspepsia.Constipation is the rule in gastric ulcer.The most important of the
various circumstances which combine to produce this condition is the
small amount of solid food taken and retained by the patient.The
restraint caused by gastric ulcer and gastric catarrh in the normal
movements of the stomach may diminish by reflex action the peristalsis
of the intestines (Traube and Radziejewski).The passage of large
quantities of blood along the intestinal canal is often associated with
colicky pains and diarrhoea.Amenorrhoea is a symptom which was formerly thought to be
characteristic of gastric ulcer, although there was much discussion as
to whether it was the cause or the result of the ulcer.Amenorrhoea is
indeed common in the gastric ulcer of young women, but there is nothing
strange in this when one considers the frequency of amenorrhoea in
general, and its causation by various debilitating and depressing
influences such as are to be found in gastric ulcer.Notwithstanding a
few striking cases which have been recorded, it has not been
demonstrated that hemorrhages vicarious of menstruation take place from
gastric ulcer.Gastric ulcer is not a febrile disease.Temporary elevation of
temperature may follow profuse gastrorrhagia and may attend various
complications, of which the most important are gastritis and
peritonitis.It has been recently claimed by Peter that the
surface-temperature of the {496} epigastrium is elevated in gastric
ulcer, but the observations upon this point are as yet too few for any
positive conclusions.[45]

[Footnote 45: According to Peter, the normal surface-temperature of the
epigastrium is from 95-1/2 degrees to 96 degrees F.(35.3 degrees to
35.5 degrees C.), while in gastric ulcer the temperature may equal or
even exceed by one or two degrees the axillary temperature.It is said
to register the highest during attacks of pain and of vomiting and
after hemorrhages (_Gaz.des Hopitaux_, June 23 and 30, 1883).See also
Beaurieux (_Essai sur la Pseudo-gastralgie, etc._, These, Paris,
1879).]The general health of the patient remains sometimes surprisingly good,
even in cases of gastric ulcer with symptoms sufficiently marked to
establish the diagnosis.But in most cases of chronic gastric ulcer the
general nutrition sooner or later becomes impaired.This cannot well be
otherwise when dyspepsia, vomiting, paroxysms of severe pain, and
hemorrhage are present, separately or in combination, for any great
length of time.In proportion to the severity and the continuance of
these symptoms the patient becomes pale, weak, and emaciated.The face,
thin, anxious, of a grayish-white color, and marked with sharp lines of
suffering, presents the appearance which the older writers called
facies abdominalis, to which even so recent an author as Brinton
attaches exaggerated diagnostic importance.A little cachectic dropsy
may appear about the ankles.While it is true that the general
nutrition is less rapidly, less continuously, and, as a rule, less
deeply, impaired in gastric ulcer than in gastric cancer, nevertheless
sometimes a cachexia develops in the former which is not to be
distinguished from that of cancer.Litten[46] relates a case of gastric
ulcer which simulated for a time pernicious anaemia.In this case the
profound anaemia could not be explained by vomiting, hemorrhage, or
other symptoms of ulcer.[Footnote 46: _Berliner klin.Beyond determining the existence of a fixed point of epigastric
tenderness, physical examination of the region of the stomach is
usually only of negative value in the diagnosis of gastric ulcer.In
some cases of ulcer of the stomach epigastric pulsation is very marked,
and sometimes most marked during gastralgic attacks.In these cases
there may be dilatation of the aorta from paralysis of vaso-motor
nerves analogous to the dilatation of the carotid and temporal arteries
in certain forms of migraine (Rosenbach).When the diagnosis lies
between gastric ulcer and gastric cancer, the presence of epigastric
tumor is justly considered to weigh against ulcer; but it is important
to know that tumor may be associated with ulcer.Thickening of the
tissues around old ulcers and the presence of adhesions may give rise
to a tumor.A thickened portion of omentum which had become adherent
over an old gastric ulcer produced a tumor which led to a mistake in
the diagnosis.[47] Rosenbach[48] calls attention to the occasional
production of false tumors by spasm of the muscular coat of the stomach
around a gastric ulcer.These tumors disappear spontaneously or yield
to the artificial distension of the stomach by Seidlitz powders--a
procedure which one would not venture to adopt if he suspected gastric
ulcer.Fenwick thinks that in some cases of gastric ulcer fixation of
the stomach by adhesions can be made out by physical exploration.[Footnote 47: A. Beer, _Wiener med.Wochenschrift_, 1882, p.The gravest symptom which can occur in gastric ulcer is the perforation
of the ulcer into the general peritoneal cavity.{497} Only rough estimates can be made of the frequency of this
symptom.These estimates vary from 2 to 25 per cent.From the data
which I have collected I infer that perforation into the general
peritoneal cavity occurs in about 6-1/2 per cent.of all cases of
gastric ulcer.[49]

[Footnote 49: Miquel (_Schmidt's Jahrb._, Bd.65, 1864) reckons
the frequency of perforation at 2 per cent.Brinton's estimate of
13-1/2 per cent.He found 69 cases of
perforation in 257 open ulcers collected from various sources.He
doubles the number of open ulcers, as he considers cicatrized ulcers
twice as frequent as the open.The statistics of some of the authors to
whom he refers should not be used in this computation, either because
they do not give accurately the number of cases of perforation, or
because they include under perforation all cases of ulcer which have
penetrated all of the coats of the stomach, whereas of course only
perforation into the general peritoneal cavity should be here included.Valuable and laborious as are Brinton's researches, his statistics upon
this point, as upon many others, are inaccurate.In 249 fatal cases of open ulcer taken from the statistics of Jaksch,
Dittrich, Willigk, Wrany (_Prager Vierteljahr._, vols.),
Eppinger, Starcke, Chambers, Moore, and Lebert (_loc.cit._), I find 50
cases of perforation into the peritoneal cavity.This makes the
percentage of perforations 6-1/2 if the open ulcers be multiplied by 3,
the number of cicatrized ulcers being taken as three times that of open
ulcers (p.This method of computation, which is adopted by
Brinton, is defective on account of the uncertainty as to the proper
proportion between cicatrized and open ulcers.Lebert observed 9 cases of perforation with fatal peritonitis in his
252 cases studied clinically.He places the frequency of perforation
with peritonitis at 3 to 5 per cent., which corresponds to Engel's
estimate of 5-1/2 per cent.(_Prager Vierteljahrschrift_, 1853, ii.).]As regards sex, perforation occurs two to three times oftener in the
female than in the male.This increased liability is referable mainly
to the preponderance of the acute perforating ulcer in young women.[50]

[Footnote 50: The liability to perforation in females seems to be not
only absolutely, but also relatively, to the number of ulcers greater
than in males, although, on the contrary, Brinton holds that the excess
of perforations in females is not greater than that of ulcers.Berthold
found perforation in 3.1 per cent.of the cases of gastric ulcer in
males, and in 9.7 per cent.In the female the liability to perforation of gastric ulcer is greatest
between fourteen and thirty years of age.In the male there seems to be
no greater liability to perforation at one age than at another.[51]

[Footnote 51: Of 139 cases of perforated ulcer in females, Brinton
found that four-fifths occurred before the age of thirty-five.He
calculates the average age at which perforation occurs in the female as
twenty-seven, and in the male as forty-two.He thinks that the average
liability to perforation in both sexes decreases as life advances,
although he holds that the liability to ulcer itself constantly
increases with age.]As will be explained in considering the morbid anatomy, ulcers of the
anterior wall of the stomach perforate more frequently than those in
other situations.As regards the symptoms which may have preceded perforation three
groups of cases can be distinguished:

In the first there has been no complaint of gastric disturbance.In the
midst of apparent health perforation may occur and cause death within a
few hours.This is the ulcere foudroyante of French writers.It is met
with more commonly in chlorotic young women than in any other class.In the second group of cases, which are more frequent, gastric symptoms
have been present for a longer or shorter time, but have been so
ambiguous that the diagnosis of gastric ulcer is not clear until
perforation occurs.Then, unfortunately, the diagnosis is of little
more than retrospective interest.In the third group of cases perforation takes place in the course of
gastric ulcer, the existence of which has been made evident by
characteristic symptoms, such as localized pain and profuse hemorrhage.{498} The immediate cause of perforation of gastric ulcer is often some
agency which produces mechanical tension of the stomach, such as
distension of the organ with food or with gas, vomiting, straining at
stool, coughing, sneezing, pressure on the epigastrium, violent
exertion, and jolting of the body.With the escape of the solid, the fluid, and the gaseous contents of
the stomach into the peritoneal cavity at the moment of perforation, an
agonizing pain is felt, beginning in the epigastrium and extending
rapidly over the abdomen, which becomes very sensitive to pressure.The
pain sometimes radiates to the shoulders.Symptoms of collapse often
appear immediately or they may develop gradually.The pulse becomes
small, rapid, and feeble.The face is pale, anxious, and drawn (facies
hippocratica).The surface of the body, particularly of the
extremities, is cold and covered with clammy sweat.The internal
temperature may be subnormal, normal, or elevated; after the
development of peritonitis it is usually, but not always, elevated.Consciousness is usually retained to the last, although the patient is
apathetic.Vomiting is sometimes absent--a circumstance which may be of
value in diagnosis, and which Traube attributes to the readiness with
which the contents of the stomach can be discharged through the
abnormal opening into the peritoneal cavity.The respirations become more and more frequent and costal
in type.Suppression of urine is not an
uncommon symptom, although there may be frequent and painful attempts
at micturition.Albumen and casts may appear temporarily in the urine.Retraction of one testicle, like that in renal colic, has been observed
(Blomfield).The patient usually lies on his back with the knees drawn
up.The abdomen is often at first hard and retracted from spasmodic
contraction of the abdominal muscles, but later it usually becomes
tympanitic, sometimes to an extreme degree.The presence of tympanitic
resonance replacing hepatic dulness in front is usually considered the
most important physical sign of gas free in the peritoneal cavity, but
this sign is equivocal.On the one hand, the presence of adhesions over
the anterior surface of the liver may prevent the gas from getting
between the liver and the diaphragm;[52] and on the other hand, in
cases of meteorism coils of intestine may make their way between the
liver and the diaphragm, or the liver may be pushed upward and
backward, so that its anterior surface becomes superior and the hepatic
dulness in front disappears.Physical examination may reveal in the
dependent parts of the peritoneal cavity an accumulation of fluid
partly escaped from the stomach and partly an inflammatory exudate.[53]
For humane reasons one should not submit the patient to the pain of
movement in order to elicit a succussion sound or to determine change
in the position of the fluid upon changing the position of the
patient.[54] There is sometimes relief from pain for some hours before
death.[Footnote 52: Even without these adhesions liver dulness may persist
after perforation of the stomach, as in a case of Nothnagel's in which
for twenty-four hours after a large perforation from gastric ulcer the
abdomen was retracted and hepatic dulness was well marked (Garmise,
_Ulcus Ventriculi cum peritonitide perforativa_, Inaug.Diss., Jena,
1879).][Footnote 53: In a case of peritonitis resulting from perforation of a
latent ulcer of the duodenum, Concato found in the acid fluid withdrawn
by aspiration from the peritoneal cavity Sarcina ventriculi (_Giorn.delle Scienze Med._, 1879, No.[Footnote 54: Other symptoms which have been thought to be diagnostic
of pneumo-peritoneum in {499} distinction from meteorism, but the value
of which is doubtful, are these: In pneumo-peritoneum the respiratory
murmur can be heard by auscultation over the entire abdomen, while in
meteorism it does not extend beyond the region of the stomach
(Cantani); in the former amphoric sounds synchronous with respiration
can sometimes be heard over the abdomen (Larghi); borborygmi are heard,
if at all, distantly and feebly; the percussion note of gas free over
the liver is different from that of tympanitic intestine (Traube); the
percussion note is of the same character over the whole anterior wall
of the abdomen; the epigastric region is more elastic to the feel than
in tympanites; the distension of the abdomen is more uniform than in
tympanites; and coils of distended intestine, sometimes showing
peristaltic movement, cannot be seen or felt as in some cases of
meteorism (Howitz).]There are exceptional cases of perforation in which some of the most
important of the enumerated symptoms, such as pain, tenderness of the
abdomen on pressure, tympanites, and the symptoms of collapse, are
absent.Death sometimes occurs from shock within six or eight hours after
perforation.More frequently life is prolonged from eighteen to
thirty-six hours, it may be even for three or four days, and, very
rarely, even longer.[55] When life is prolonged more than twelve hours
an acute diffuse peritonitis is usually but not always developed.[Footnote 55: In the _Descriptive Catalogue of the Warren Anatomical
Museum_, by Dr.J. B. S. Jackson, p.448, Boston, 1870, is described a
case of gastric ulcer in which, so far as can be judged by the symptoms
and the post-mortem appearances, the patient lived nineteen days after
perforation.]The contents of the stomach, instead of being diffused throughout the
peritoneal cavity, may be confined by a rapidly-developed circumscribed
peritonitis to a space near the stomach, or perforation may occur into
a space previously shut off from the general peritoneal sac by
adhesions.In this way circumscribed peritoneal abscesses form in the
neighborhood of the stomach.Diffuse peritonitis may be caused either
by an extension of the inflammation or by the rupture of these
abscesses into the general peritoneal cavity.The cases of
circumscribed peritonitis following perforation of gastric ulcer, with
escape of the contents of the stomach, although more protracted than
those in which the whole peritoneal surface is at once involved,
generally terminate fatally sooner or later.The most interesting of these peritoneal abscesses is the variety to
which Leyden has given the name of pyo-pneumothorax subphrenicus (false
pneumothorax of Cossy), the diagnostic features of which first were
recognized by G. W. Barlow and Wilks in 1845.[56] Here there is a
cavity, circumscribed by adhesions, just beneath the diaphragm,
containing pus and gas and communicating with either the stomach or the
intestine.By the encroachment of this cavity upon the thoracic space
the symptoms and signs of pyo-pneumothorax are simulated.Barlow and
Leyden have diagnosed during life this affection when resulting from
perforated gastric ulcer.The points in diagnosis from genuine
pyo-pneumothorax are the presence of respiratory murmur from the
clavicle to the third rib, the extension of the respiratory murmur
downward by deep inspiration, history of preceding gastric disturbance
with circumscribed peritonitis, absence of preceding pulmonary
symptoms, rapid variations in the limits of dulness with changes in the
position of the body, absence or only slight evidence of increased
intrapleural pressure (such as bulging of the {500} thorax as a whole,
and of the intercostal spaces), displacement of the heart, displacement
of the liver downward, and, if necessary, the determination by means of
a manometer that the pressure in the abscess cavity rises during
inspiration and falls during expiration, the reverse being true in
genuine pneumothorax.[57]

[Footnote 56: Barlow and Wilks, _London Med.Gazette_, May, 1845;
Leyden, _Zeitschr.Med._, i. Heft 2; Cossy, _Arch.de
Med._, Nov., 1879; Tillmanns, _Arch.[Footnote 57: Schreiber has shown that this last diagnostic point,
which was given by Leyden, is not without exceptions, for the pressure
in the peritoneal cavity may sink during inspiration and rise during
expiration (as in the pleural cavity), especially when the diaphragm
takes little or no part in respiration ("Ueber Pleural- und
Peritonealdruck," _Deutsches Arch.Med._, July 31, 1883).]Through the medium of subphrenic abscess, or directly through adhesions
between the stomach and the diaphragm, gastric ulcer may perforate into
one of the pleural cavities (generally the left) and cause empyema or
pneumo-pyothorax.Adhesions may form between the diaphragm and the
pulmonary pleura, so that the ulcer perforates directly into the lung;
in which case pulmonary gangrene or pulmonary abscess is usually
developed.The diagnosis of the perforation into the lung has been made
by recognizing a sour odor and sour reaction of the expectoration, and
by finding in the sputum particles of food derived from the stomach.Sudden death from suffocation has followed perforation of the stomach
into the lung.[58]

[Footnote 58: Tillmanns (_loc.cit._) has collected 12 cases of
communication between the stomach and the thoracic cavity from
perforation of gastric ulcer; all proved fatal.In Sturges's case of
recovery from pneumothorax supposed to be produced by perforation of a
gastric ulcer the diagnosis of the cause of the pneumothorax was very
doubtful (_The Lancet_, Feb.Perforation of gastric ulcer into the transverse colon has been
followed by the vomiting of formed feces and by the passage of
undigested food by the bowel (Abercrombie).Enemata may be vomited, so
that, as suggested by Murchison, the introduction of  enemata
may aid in the diagnosis.Gastro-cutaneous fistulae are among the rare results of perforation of
gastric ulcer.In these cases food, sometimes only in liquid form,
escapes through the fistula.The opening of gastric ulcer into the pericardium is one of the rare
causes of pneumo-pericardium.Other varieties of perforation which are of pathological rather than of
clinical interest will be mentioned under the morbid anatomy of gastric
ulcer.COURSE.--Few diseases are more variable in their course and duration
than is simple gastric ulcer.It is customary to distinguish between
acute and chronic forms of gastric ulcer, but this is a distinction
which cannot be sharply drawn.Those cases are called acute in which,
with absence or short duration of antecedent gastric symptoms,
perforation or gastrorrhagia suddenly causes death.But in some of
these cases the thickened and indurated margins of the ulcer found at
the autopsy show that the disease has been of much longer duration than
the clinical history would indicate.Still, there is reason to believe
that within the course of a few days ulcers may form and perforate all
of the coats of the stomach.In the great majority of cases of gastric ulcer the tendency is to
assume a chronic course, so that the often-used term chronic gastric
ulcer is generally applicable.{501} The great diversity of the symptoms in different cases makes it
impossible to give a generally applicable description of the course of
gastric ulcer.It is, however, useful to designate the main clinical
forms of the disease.Latent ulcers, with entire absence of symptoms, and revealed as open
ulcers or as cicatrices at the autopsy.With or without a period of brief gastric
disturbance perforation occurs and causes speedy death.Acute hemorrhagic form of gastric ulcer.After a latent or a brief
course of the ulcer profuse gastrorrhagia occurs, which may terminate
fatally or may be followed by the symptoms of chronic ulcer.Gastralgic-dyspeptic form.In this, which is the most common form of
gastric ulcer gastralgia, dyspepsia and vomiting are the symptoms.Sometimes one of the symptoms predominates greatly over the others, so
that Lebert distinguishes separately a gastralgic, a dyspeptic, and a
vomitive variety.Gastralgia is the most frequent symptom.Gastrorrhagia is a marked symptom, and
occurs usually in combination with the symptoms just mentioned.This usually corresponds only to the final stage of
one of the preceding forms, but the cachexia may develop so rapidly and
become so marked that the course of the disease closely resembles that
of gastric cancer.In this the symptoms of gastric ulcer disappear, and
then follow intervals, often of considerable duration, in which there
is apparent cure, but the symptoms return, especially after some
indiscretion in the mode of living.This intermittent course may
continue for many years.In these cases it is probable either that
fresh ulcers form or that the cicatrix of an old ulcer becomes
ulcerated.By the formation of cicatricial tissue in and around
the ulcer the pyloric orifice becomes obstructed and the symptoms of
dilatation of the stomach develop.DURATION.--The average duration of gastric ulcer may be said to be from
three to five years, but this estimate is not of great value, on
account of the absence of any regularity in the course and duration of
the disease.In cases of very protracted duration, such as forty years
in a case of Habershon's and thirty-five in one of Brinton's, it is
uncertain whether the symptoms are referable to the persistence of one
ulcer or to the formation of new ulcers, or to sequels resulting from
cicatrization.In 110 cases (44 fatal) analyzed by Lebert[59] the course was latent
until the occurrence of perforation or of profuse hemorrhage in 15 per
cent., the duration was less than one year in 18 per cent., from one to
six years in 46-1/2 per cent., from six to twenty years in 18 per
cent., from twenty to thirty-five years in 2-1/2 per cent.TERMINATIONS.--In the majority of cases gastric ulcer terminates in
recovery.Various gastric disturbances
may, however, follow the cicatrization of gastric ulcer, especially if
the ulcer was large and of long duration.These sequential disturbances
are due to the contraction of the cicatrix, to adhesions between the
stomach and surrounding parts, to deformity of the stomach, and
especially to dilatation of the stomach by cicatricial stenosis of the
pylorus.Hence, {502} gastralgia, dyspepsia, and vomiting may continue
after the ulcer has healed, so that anatomical cure of the ulcer is not
always recovery in the clinical sense.Relapses may occur after
recovery, as those who have once had gastric ulcer are more prone to
the disease than are others.Not infrequently the patient recovers so
far as to be able to attend to the active duties of life, but to avoid
renewed attacks he is always obliged to be very careful as regards his
mode of living.How often gastric ulcer ends in death it is impossible to say.It is
certain that Brinton under-estimates the number of recoveries when he
computes that only one-half of the ulcers cicatrize.Lebert reckons the
mortality from gastric ulcer as 10 per cent., which appears to be too
low an estimate.would be a more correct estimate
of the mortality.The causes of death are perforation, hemorrhage, exhaustion, and
complicating diseases.of the cases of gastric ulcer terminate fatally
by perforation into the peritoneal cavity.Although this estimate can
be considered only approximative, there is little doubt but that the
much larger percentages given by most writers are excessive, and are
referable to the undue frequency with which cases of perforation of
gastric ulcer have been published.Such cases naturally make a strong
impression upon the observer, and are more likely to be published than
those which terminate in other ways.Death from hemorrhage occurs probably in from 3 to 5 per cent.of the
cases of gastric ulcer.[60] In many more cases hemorrhage is an
indirect cause of death by inducing anaemia.Unlike perforation, fatal
hemorrhage from gastric ulcer is more common in males than in
females--more common after than before forty years of age.The average
age at which fatal hemorrhage occurs is given by Brinton as forty-three
and a half years both for males and females.[Footnote 60: In 270 fatal cases of open ulcer from the statistics of
Jaksch, Dittrich, Eppinger, Starcke, Chambers, Habershon, Moore, and
Lebert, I find 27 deaths by hemorrhage.Reckoning three cicatrices to
one ulcer, this would give a percentage of 3-1/3.]In a considerable proportion of the fatal cases exhaustion is the cause
of death.According to Lebert, death from exhaustion occurs in about 4
per cent.The causes of exhaustion are
the pain, hemorrhage, dyspepsia, and vomiting which constitute the
leading symptoms of the disease.Finally, death may be due to some of the complications or sequels of
gastric ulcer.COMPLICATIONS.--Some of the complications of gastric ulcer are directly
referable to the ulcer, others are only remotely related to it, and
others are merely accidental.Pylephlebitis is among the most important of the complications directly
referable to the ulcer.This pylephlebitis is usually of the infectious
variety, and leads to abscesses in the liver, sometimes to abscesses in
the spleen and other organs.As has already been mentioned, chronic catarrhal gastritis stands in
close relationship to gastric ulcer.Chronic peritonitis is a rare
complication of gastric ulcer (Moore, Vierordt).Chronic interstitial
gastritis, with contraction of the stomach and thickening of its walls,
was {503} associated with ulcer in a case under my observation.In a
case of ulcer under the care of Owen Rees[61] this condition of the
stomach was associated with chronic deforming peritonitis (thickening,
induration, and contraction of the peritoneum) and ascites, so that the
symptoms during life and the gross appearances after death resembled
cancerous diseases of the peritoneum.Simple ulcer and cancer may occur
together in the same stomach, or cancer may develop in an ulcer or its
cicatrix.Glasser reports a case of phlegmonous gastritis with gastric
ulcer.[62] Extension of inflammation to the pleura without perforation
of the diaphragm sometimes occurs.Fatty degeneration of the heart may
be the result of profound anaemia induced by gastric ulcer.[63] Embolic
pneumonia and broncho-pneumonia are occasional complications.A
moderate degree of cachectic dropsy is not very infrequent in the late
stages of gastric ulcer.Times and Gaz._, April 24, 1869.]Wochenschrift_, 1883, No.[Footnote 63: Shattuck, _Boston Med.Journ._, June, 1880,
vol.Other complications, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, valvular disease
of the heart, general atheroma of the arteries, cirrhosis of the liver,
syphilis, chronic Bright's disease, waxy degenerations, and malaria,
have been considered under the Etiology, and some of them will be
referred to again in connection with the Pathology, of gastric ulcer.In most instances when ulcer is associated with these diseases the
ulcer is secondary.SEQUELAE.--The most important sequelae of gastric ulcer are changes in
the form of the stomach in consequence of adhesions and in consequence
of the formation and contraction of cicatrices.These lesions are most
conveniently described under the Morbid Anatomy.The symptoms of the
most important of these sequels--namely, stenosis of the pylorus with
dilatation of the stomach--will be described in another article.MORBID ANATOMY.--As regards number, simple ulcer of the stomach is
usually single, but occasionally two or more ulcers are present.It is
not uncommon to meet in the same stomach open ulcers and the scars of
healed ulcers.According to Brinton, multiple ulcers are found in about
one-fifth of the cases.In one case O'Rorke found six ulcers on the
anterior wall of the stomach.[64] Berthold mentions a case in which
thirty-four ulcers were found in the same stomach.[65]

[Footnote 64: _Trans.Wollmann mentions the occurrence of over eight simple ulcers in the
same stomach (_Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresb._, 1868, Bd.It is expressly stated that these were
not hemorrhagic erosions, but deep corrosive ulcers.]The usual position of simple gastric ulcer is the posterior wall of the
pyloric portion of the stomach on or near the lesser curvature.Ulcers
of the anterior wall are rare, but they carry a special danger from
their liability to perforate without protective adhesions.The least
frequent seats of ulcer are the greater curvature and the fundus.The table on page 504 gives the situation of 793 ulcers recorded in
hospital statistics:[66] {504}

  Lesser curvature   288 (36.3 per cent.)Posterior wall     235 (29.6    "     )
  Pylorus             95 (12      "     )
  Anterior wall       69 ( 8.7    "     )
  Cardia              50 ( 6.3    "     )
  Fundus              29 ( 3.7    "     )
  Greater curvature   27 ( 3.4    "     )

From this table it is apparent that ulcers occupy the lesser curvature,
the posterior wall, and the pyloric region three and a half times more
frequently than they do the remaining larger segment of the stomach.[Footnote 66: These statistics are collected from the previously-cited
works of Rokitansky, Jaksch, Wrany, Eppinger, Chambers, Habershon,
Steiner, Wollmann, Berthold, Starcke, Lebert, and Moore.So far as noted, most of the ulcers on the posterior wall
were nearer to the lesser curvature than to the greater; those on the
lesser curvature extended more frequently to the posterior than to the
anterior wall.Although not apparent from the table, most of the ulcers
of the lesser curvature and of the posterior wall were in the pyloric
region.So far as possible, cicatrices were excluded.Pylorus and
cardia in the table indicate on or near those parts.]Occasionally two ulcers are seated directly opposite to each other, the
one on the anterior, the other on the posterior, wall of the stomach.The most plausible explanation of this is that the ulcers are caused by
a simultaneous affection of corresponding branches which are given off
symmetrically from the same arterial trunk as it runs along one of the
curvatures of the stomach (Virchow).[67]

[Footnote 67: A. Beer, "Aus dem path.R.
Virchow, etc.," _Wiener med.The ordinary size of the ulcer varies from a half inch to two inches in
diameter.The ulcer may be very minute, as in two cases reported by
Murchison, in each of which a pore-like hole was found leading into a
perforated artery from which fatal hemorrhage had occurred.[68] On the
other hand, the ulcer may attain an enormous size, extending sometimes
from the cardiac to the pyloric orifice and measuring five or six
inches in diameter.[69]

[Footnote 68: Murchison, _Trans.[Footnote 69: In one of Cruveilhier's cases the ulcer was 6-1/2 inches
long and 3-1/3 inches wide.Law describes an ulcer measuring 6 inches
by 3 inches (_Dublin Hosp.The ulcer is usually round or oval in shape.The outline of the ulcer
may become irregular by unequal extension in the periphery, or by the
coalescence of two or more ulcers, or by partial cicatrization.Simple
ulcers, especially when seated near the lesser curvature, have a
tendency to extend transversely to the long axis of the stomach, thus
following the course of the blood-vessels.By this mode of extension,
or more frequently by the coalescence of several ulcers, are formed
girdle ulcers, which more or less completely surround the circumference
of the stomach, oftener in the pyloric region than elsewhere.As the ulcer extends in depth it often destroys each successive layer
of the stomach in less extent than the preceding one, so that the form
of the ulcer is conical or funnel-shaped, with a terrace-like
appearance in its sloping edges.The apex of the truncated cone, which
is directed toward the peritoneum, is often not directly opposite to
the centre of the base or superior surface which occupies the mucous
membrane, so that one side of the cone may be vertical and the other
sloping.In the half of the stomach nearer the lesser curvature the
cone <DW72>s upward, and in the lower half of the stomach it <DW72>s
downward.The usual explanation of its conical shape is that the ulcer
exactly corresponds to the territory supplied by an artery with its
branches.Virchow finds an explanation for the oblique direction of the
funnel in the arrangement of the arteries of the stomach.These, coming
from different sources, run along the curvatures of the stomach, and
there give off symmetrically branches which run obliquely toward the
mucous membrane, so that one of these {505} branches with its
distributive twigs (arterial tree) would supply a part shaped like an
oblique funnel.One of the chief supports of the theory which refers
the origin of simple gastric ulcer to an arrest of the circulation is
this correspondence in shape of the ulcer to the area of distribution
of the branches of the arteries supplying the stomach.All ulcers do not present the conical form and terraced edges which
have been described.These appearances are far from constant in fresh
ulcers, and they are usually absent in those of long duration.The most characteristic anatomical feature of simple ulcer of the
stomach is the appearance of the edges and of the floor of the ulcer.The edges of recently-formed ulcers (acute ulcers) are clean-cut,
smooth, and not swollen.To use Rokitansky's well-known comparison, the
hole in the mucous coat looks as if it had been punched out by an
instrument.The floor of the ulcer may be smooth and firm or soft and
pulpy.The floor and edges of fresh ulcers are often infiltrated with
blood, but they may be of a pale-grayish color.Usually no granulations
and no pus are to be seen on the surface of the ulcer.[70] In ulcers of
longer duration the margins become thickened, indurated, and abrupt;
the floor acquires a dense fibrous structure.[Footnote 70: In rare instances granulations may be present, as in a
case of W. Muller's, in which their presence rendered difficult the
diagnosis of simple ulcer from carcinoma (_Jenaische Zeitschrift_, v.,
1870).The microscope may also be required to distinguish the
irregularly thickened margins of old ulcers from scirrhous cancer.]The floor of the ulcer may be the submucous, the muscular, or the
serous coat, or, if the whole thickness of the stomach be perforated,
it may be some adjacent organ to which the stomach has become adherent,
this organ being usually the pancreas or the left lobe of the liver or
neighboring lymphatic glands.The microscopic examination of recently-formed ulcers shows that the
tissue immediately surrounding the ulcer is composed of granular
material, disintegrated red blood-corpuscles, pale and swollen
fragments of connective-tissue fibres, and cells unaffected by
nuclear-staining dyes.The red blood-corpuscles are sometimes broken
into fragments of various sizes in about the same way as by the action
of heat.The gastric tubules are separated from each other and
compressed by infiltrated blood, and contain cells which do not stain.Around this margin of molecular disintegration, which has evidently
been produced by the action of the gastric juice, there is often,
although not constantly, a zone of infiltration with small round cells,
probably emigrated white blood-corpuscles.These cells are most
abundant near the muscularis mucosae and in the submucosa.Extravasated
red blood-corpuscles extend a variable distance around the ulcer,
farthest as a rule in the submucous coat.Many of the blood-vessels in
the immediate neighborhood of the ulcer appear normal; others,
particularly the arterioles and the capillaries, may be filled with
hyaline thrombi.Clumps of hyaline material may also be seen in the
meshes of the tissue around the ulcer.Fine fatty granules may be seen
in the tissue near the ulcer.The interstices of the loose submucous
tissue and the lymphatic vessels are often filled with fibrillated
fibrin and scattered blood-corpuscles for a considerable distance
around the ulcer.In the margins of old gastric ulcers there is also a zone of molecular
necrosis.The induration and the thickening of the edges of these
ulcers {506} are caused by a new growth of fibrillated connective
tissue, which blends together all of the coats invaded by the ulcer.This new tissue is usually rich in lymphoid cells, which are often most
abundant in the lymphatic channels.In the fibrous edges and base of
old ulcers are arteries which are the seat of an obliterating
endarteritis, and which may be completely obliterated by this process.An interstitial neuritis may affect the nerve-trunks involved in the
fibrous growth.Blood-pigment may be present as an evidence of an old
hemorrhagic infiltration.[71]

[Footnote 71: The histological changes here described are based upon
the examination of typical specimens both of recent and of old gastric
ulcers which have come under my observation.]Cicatrization is accomplished by the development of fibrous tissue in
the floor and borders of the ulcer.By the contraction of this
new-formed tissue the edges of the mucous membrane are united to the
floor of the ulcer, and may be drawn together so as to close completely
the defect in the mucous membrane.The result is a white stellate
cicatrix, which is usually somewhat depressed and surrounded by
puckered mucous membrane.It is probable that small, superficial ulcers
may be closed so that the scar cannot be detected.The mucous membrane
which has been drawn over the cicatrix is intimately blended with the
fibrous substratum, and is usually itself invaded by fibrous tissue
which compresses and distorts the gastric tubules.Hauser[72] has shown
that the tubular glands grow down into the cicatricial tissue, where
they may branch in all directions.These new-formed tubules are lined
by clear cylindrical or cutical epithelial cells, and may undergo
cystic dilatation.Very irregular cicatrices may result from the
healing of large and irregular ulcers.When the ulcer is large and deep
and the stomach is adherent to surrounding parts, the edges of the
mucous membrane making the border of the ulcer cannot be united by the
contraction of the fibrous tissue in the floor of the ulcer.The
cicatrix of such ulcers consists of fibrous tissue uncovered by mucous
membrane.Such cicatrices are
liable to be the seat of renewed ulceration.[Footnote 72: _Das chronische Magengeschwur, etc._, Leipzig, 1883.In
the rare instances of carcinoma developing in the borders or in the
cicatrix of gastric ulcer, Hauser believes that the cancerous growth
starts from these glandular growths, which in general have only the
significance of Friedlander's atypical proliferation of epithelial
cells.]The formation and contraction of the cicatrix may cause various
deformities of the stomach.The character of these deformities depends
upon the situation, the size, and the depth of the ulcer which is
cicatrized.Among the most important of these distortions are stenosis
of the pyloric orifice, followed by dilatation of the stomach, more
rarely stenosis of the cardiac orifice, with contraction of the
stomach, approximation of the cardiac and of the pyloric orifices by
the healing of ulcers on the lesser curvature, and an hour-glass form
of the stomach, produced by the cicatrization of girdle ulcers or of a
series of ulcers extending around the stomach.These abnormalities in
form of the stomach, particularly the constriction of the orifices, may
be attended by more serious symptoms than the original ulcer.As the ulcer extends in depth a circumscribed peritonitis, resulting in
the formation of adhesions between the stomach and surrounding parts,
is usually excited before the serous coat is perforated, so that the
gravest of all possible accidents in the course of gastric
ulcer--namely, perforation {507} into the peritoneal sac--is
permanently or temporarily averted.It has been estimated that
adhesions form in about two-fifths of all cases of gastric ulcer
(Jaksch).On account of the usual position of the ulcer on the lesser
curvature or on the posterior wall of the stomach, the adhesions are
most frequently with the pancreas (in about one-half of all cases of
adhesion); next in frequency with the left lobe of the liver; rarely
with other parts, such as the lymphatic glands, the diaphragm, the
spleen, the kidney, the suprarenal capsule, the omentum, the colon, and
other parts of the intestine, the gall-bladder, the sternum, and the
anterior abdominal wall.Adhesions cannot readily form between the
anterior surface of the stomach and the anterior abdominal wall, on
account of the constant movement of these parts, so that ulcers of the
anterior gastric wall are those most liable to perforate into the
peritoneal cavity.It is difficult to include in any description all of the various and
complicated lesions which may result from perforation by gastric ulcer
of all of the coats of the stomach.The consequences of perforation may
be conveniently classified as follows:

1.Some solid organ, usually the pancreas, the liver, or the lymphatic
glands, may close the hole in the stomach.An intra-peritoneal sac shut in by adhesions may communicate through
the ulcer with the cavity of the stomach.A fistulous communication may form either between the stomach and
the exterior (external gastric fistula) or between the stomach and some
hollow viscus (internal gastric fistula).The ulcer may perforate into the general peritoneal cavity.These lesions may be variously combined with each other.It is to be
noted that in the first three varieties protective adhesions are
present, and that in the last these adhesions are either absent or
ruptured.When the pancreas, the liver, or the spleen form the floor of the
ulcer, they may be protected from extension of the ulcerative process
by a new growth of fibrous tissue extending from the floor of the ulcer
a variable depth into these organs.Sometimes, however, the ulcerative
process, aided doubtless by the corroding action of the gastric juice,
eats out large excavations in these organs.These excavations
communicate with the cavity of the stomach, and are usually filled with
ichorous pus.The pancreas, unlike the spleen and the liver, possesses
comparative immunity against this invasion by the ulcerative process.The situation, the form, and the extent of circumscribed peritoneal
abscesses resulting from perforation of gastric ulcer depend upon the
parts with which the stomach has contracted adhesions.Should an ulcer
on the posterior wall of the stomach perforate before the formation of
adhesions, the perforation would of course be directly into the lesser
peritoneal cavity.An interesting example of this rare occurrence has
been communicated by Chiari.[73] In this case, the foramen of Winslow
being closed by adhesions, the lesser peritoneal cavity which
communicated with a gastric ulcer was filled with ichorous pus, and in
this floated the pancreas, which had necrosed in mass and had separated
as a sequestrum.That form of intra-peritoneal abscess known as
subphrenic pneumo-pyothorax has been already described under
Symptomatology.Peritoneal abscesses communicating with the stomach may
open into various places, {508} as into the general peritoneal cavity,
into the pleural cavity, into the retro-peritoneal tissue, through the
abdominal or thoracic walls, etc.Wochenschr._, 1876, No.Gastro-cutaneous fistulae are a rare result of the perforation of
gastric ulcer.[74] The external opening is most frequently in the
umbilical region, but it may be in the epigastric or in the left
hypochondriac region or between the ribs.Fistulous communications
resulting from the perforation of gastric ulcer have been formed
between the stomach and one or more of the following hollow viscera or
cavities: the colon, the duodenum and other parts of the small
intestine, the gall-bladder, the common bile-duct, the pancreatic duct,
the pleura, the lung, the left bronchus, the pericardium, and the left
ventricle.Gastro-colic fistulae, in contrast to gastro-cutaneous
fistulae, are more frequently produced by cancer than by ulcer of the
stomach.[75] In rare instances the peritoneum over ulcers of the lesser
curvature has contracted adhesions with the pyloric portion of the
stomach or with the first part of the duodenum.To accomplish this it
is necessary that a sharp bend in the lesser curvature should take
place.By extension of the ulcerative process abnormal communication is
established between the left and the right half of the stomach or
between the stomach and the duodenum.In either case the right half of
the stomach is often converted into a large blind diverticulum, the
digested food passing through the abnormal opening.[76] Gastro-duodenal
fistulae are more frequently with the third than with the first part of
the duodenum.In one of Starcke's cases the stomach communicated with
the colon and through the medium of a subphrenic abscess with the left
lung.[77]

[Footnote 74: Of the 25 cases of gastro-cutaneous fistula collected by
Murchison, 18 were the result of disease.In 12 of these cases the
probable cause was simple gastric ulcer (_Med.-Chir.Middeldorpf says that among the internal causes
of the 47 cases of external gastric fistula which he tabulated, simple
ulcer of the stomach played an important role (_Wiener med.Wochenschr._, 1860).][Footnote 75: Of 33 cases of gastro-colic fistula collected by
Murchison, 21 were from gastric cancer and 9 or 10 probably from simple
ulcer.On the other hand, gastro-cutaneous fistulae are twice as
frequently the result of simple ulcer as of cancer (_Edinb.[Footnote 76: Thierfelder has made the best study of the complicated
relations existing in these cases (_Deutsches Arch.[Footnote 77: _Deutsche Klinik_, 1870, No.Habershon also reports a
case in which a subphrenic abscess communicated with the lung, the
stomach, and the colon, but he believes that the ulceration was primary
in the colon (_Guy's Hosp.Four cases of perforation of gastric ulcer into the pericardium,[78]
with the production of pneumo-pericardium, have been reported, and two
cases of perforation into the left ventricle.[79] Muller found
lumbricoid worms in a pleural cavity which had been perforated by
gastric ulcer.[80] Diaphragmatic hernia may result from perforation of
the pleural cavity by gastric ulcer.[81] In one instance the greater
part of the small intestines {509} passed through a hole in the
transverse meso-colon which had been caused by a gastric ulcer.[Footnote 78: Hallin, _Schmidt's Jahrb._, cxix.37; Saxinger,

College, London, of a simple gastric ulcer opening into the pericardium

Gunsburg's the hole in the diaphragm was as large as the hand, and the
left pleural cavity contained the upper half of the stomach and the
spleen (_Arch.The various fistulae which have been mentioned may be either direct or
through the medium of an abscess.While some of them are only
pathological curiosities, others, particularly the communications of
the stomach with the pleural cavity and with the lung, are sufficiently
frequent to be of practical clinical interest.As has already been explained, ulcers of the anterior wall are the ones
most liable to perforate into the general peritoneal cavity,[82] but on
account of their comparative infrequency perforation occurs oftener in
other situations, particularly in the lesser curvature and near the
pylorus.Except on the anterior wall the perforation is often brought
about by the rupture of adhesions which for a time had prevented this
accident.In a considerable number of cases, particularly of ulcers on
the anterior wall, the ulcer looks as if recently formed (acute
perforating ulcer); in other cases its thickened and indurated margins
indicate long duration.Chiari[83] describes a case in which rupture
into the peritoneal cavity took place through the cicatrix of an old
ulcer, probably in consequence of the distension of the stomach with
gas.The hole in the peritoneum is usually circular, smaller than the
inner surface of the ulcer, and has sharp, well-defined edges.Less
frequently the edges are ragged.Post-mortem digestion may, however, so
change the borders of the opening as to make it difficult or impossible
to tell from their post-mortem appearances alone whether perforation
has occurred before or after death.The peritoneal cavity after death
from perforation is found to contain gas and substances from the
stomach.Usually within a few hours after perforation septic
peritonitis is excited, but in exceptional cases no inflammation of the
peritoneum has occurred even when life has been prolonged twenty-four
hours after perforation.[Footnote 82: According to Brinton, "the proportion of perforations to
ulcers is such that of every 100 ulcers in each of the following
situations, the numbers which perforate are--on the posterior surface,
about 2; the pyloric sac, 10; the middle of the organ, 13; the lesser
curvature, 18; the anterior and posterior surface at once, 28; the
cardiac extremity, 40; and the anterior surface, 85."]Emphysema of the subcutaneous, subperitoneal, and other loose areolar
tissue of the body is a rare but remarkable result of the perforation
of gastric ulcer.The emphysema is sometimes observed shortly before
death, but it attains its maximum development after death, when it may
spread rapidly over the greater part of the body.The gas consists in
part of hydrogen, as it burns with a blue flame.It is generated, at
least in great part, by fermentation of the contents of the stomach.The gas may enter the subserous tissue at the edges of the ulcer and
thence spread, or, after perforation of the stomach, it may make its
way from the peritoneal cavity into the loose subserous connective
tissue through some place in the parietal peritoneum which has been
macerated, perhaps by the digestive action of the gastric juice.[84]

[Footnote 84: Roger (_Arch.de Med._, 1862) and Demarquay (_Essai
de Pneumatologie medicale_, Paris, 1866) deserve the credit of first
calling general attention to the occurrence of subcutaneous emphysema
after rupture of the digestive tract.The following writers have each
reported a case of emphysema following the perforation of gastric
ulcers: Cruveilhier, _Anat.Path._, t. i. livr.783; Thierfelder, _Deutsches Arch.Med._,
iv., 1868, p.33; Newman, _The Lancet_, 1868, vol.728;
Poensgen, _Das subcutane Emphysem nach continuitatstrennungen des
Digestionstractus, etc._, Inaug.Diss., Strassburg, 1879, p.40;
Korach, _Deutsche med.Wochenschr._, 1880 p.275; {510} Jurgensen,
_Deutsches Arch.Doubtful cases
are reported by Lefevre, W. Mayer, and Burggraeve.The fullest
consideration of the subject is to be found in the dissertation of
Poensgen.]In two cases of sudden death from gastric ulcer Jurgensen found gas in
the veins and arteries of various parts of the body.He believes that
this gas, which certainly was not the result of putrefaction after
death, was derived from the stomach, and that it entered during life
the circulation through vessels exposed in the borders of the ulcer,
thus causing death.In one of the cases a profuse hemorrhage preceded
death, and in the other the ulcer had perforated into the peritoneal
cavity.[85]

[Footnote 85: Jurgensen does not consider whether this gas may not have
made its way into the blood-vessels after death in a manner similar to
its extension through the cellular tissue of the body in the cases of
emphysema just mentioned.In the case which he has reported in full
interstitial and subserous emphysema could be traced from the ulcer
("Luft im Blute," _Deutsches Arch.The source of hemorrhage from gastric ulcer is from blood-vessels
either in the stomach itself or in the neighborhood of the stomach.Hemorrhages slight or of moderate severity occur from the capillaries
and small arteries and veins in the mucous and submucous coats.Sometimes profuse and even fatal hemorrhage comes from arteries or from
veins in the submucous coat, especially when these vessels are dilated.Quickly-fatal hemorrhages take place from the large vessels between the
muscular and the serous coats, particularly from the main trunks on the
curvatures.After the formation of adhesions, followed by the
perforation of all of the coats of the stomach, profuse bleeding may
proceed from the erosion of large vessels near the stomach, such as the
splenic, the hepatic, the pancreatico-duodenal arteries, the portal and
the splenic veins, and the mesenteric vessels.Bleeding may also occur
from vessels in the parenchyma of organs invaded by the ulcer.The most
common source of fatal hemorrhage is from the splenic artery, which
from its position is peculiarly exposed to invasion by ulcers of the
posterior wall of the stomach.The hemorrhage is usually arterial in
origin.It may come from miliary aneurisms of the gastric arteries or
from varicose veins in the wall of the stomach.As Cruveilhier has
pointed out, an ulcer may cicatrize except over one spot corresponding
to an artery from which fatal hemorrhage may occur.Ulcers which give
rise to large hemorrhages are usually chronic in their course.Those
seated on the middle of the anterior wall, although peculiarly liable
to perforate, are comparatively exempt from hemorrhage on account of
the small size of the blood-vessels there.Changes in the blood-vessels of the stomach have been seen in a
considerable number of cases of gastric ulcer.Instances have been
recorded of the association with gastric ulcer of most of the diseases
to which blood-vessels are subject.An example in all respects
convincing of embolism of the artery supplying the ulcerated region of
the stomach has not been published.Probably the best case belonging
here is one of perforating ulcer of the stomach with hemorrhagic
infiltration in its walls, presented by Janeway to the New York
Pathological Society in 1871.[86] In this case there was in the
gastro-epiploic artery an ante-mortem fibrinous plug which was
continued into the nutrient artery of the ulcerated piece of the
stomach.No source for an embolus could be found.In one case Merkel
found an embolus in a small artery leading to an ulcer {511} of the
duodenum.[87] The arch of the aorta was atheromatous and contained a
thrombus.Patches of hemorrhagic infiltration existed in the stomach.In many cases thrombosis of the arteries, and especially of the veins
involved in the diseased tissue around an ulcer, has been observed, and
in some the thrombus was prolonged in the vessels for a considerable
distance from the ulcer.It is probable that in most of these cases the
thrombus was secondary to the ulcer.Hyaline thrombosis of the
capillaries near the ulcer is also to be mentioned.In a certain, but not large, number of cases atheroma with
calcification or with fatty degeneration of the arteries of the stomach
has been found associated with gastric ulcer.[88] Reference has already
been made to the occurrence of obliterating endarteritis in the
thickened edges and floor of gastric ulcer, where it is doubtless
secondary.In one case of gastric ulcer I found a widespread
obliterating endarteritis affecting small and medium-sized arteries in
many parts of the body, including the stomach.[89]

[Footnote 88: For cases in point see Norman Moore, _Trans.[Footnote 89: On the posterior wall of the stomach, midway between the
greater and the lesser curvature and five inches to the right of the
cardiac orifice, was a round ulcer half an inch in diameter, with
smooth, sharp edges.In the floor of the ulcer, which extended to the
muscular coat, was a small perforated aneurism of a branch of the
coronary artery.In addition there were small, granular kidneys,
hypertrophied heart without valvular lesion, and chronic interstitial
splenitis.Small and medium-sized arteries in the kidneys, spleen,
heart, lymphatic glands, and stomach were the seat of a typical
endarteritis obliterans, resulting in some instances in complete
closure of the lumen of the vessel.The patient, who was attended by
Sassdorf, was seized during the night with vomiting of blood, which
continued at intervals for twenty-four hours until his death.The
patient was a man about fifty years of age, without previous history of
gastric ulcer or of syphilis.]In one case Powell[90] found a small aneurism of the coronary artery in
an ulcer of the lesser curvature of the stomach.Hauser[91] found an
aneurismal dilatation of an atheromatous and thrombosed arterial twig
in the floor of a recent ulcer.In my case of obliterating endarteritis
just referred to there was a small aneurism in the floor of the ulcer.These miliary aneurisms in the floor of gastric ulcers seem to be
analogous to those in the walls of phthisical cavities.Miliary
aneurisms occur in the stomach independently of gastric ulcer, and may
give rise to fatal haematemesis, as in four cases reported by
Galliard.[92]

[Footnote 90: _Trans.[Footnote 91: _Das chronische Magengeschwur, etc._, p.11, Leipzig,
1883.][Footnote 92: _L'Union med._, Feb.Curtis reported a case of
fatal haematemesis from an aneurism, not larger than a small pea,
seated in the cicatrix of an old ulcer (_Med.Annals of Albany_, Aug.,
1880).]Gastric ulcer is occasionally associated with waxy degeneration of the
arteries of the stomach.[93] In most of these cases there were multiple
shallow ulcers.Haematemesis is generally absent in gastric ulcer
resulting from waxy disease of the gastric blood-vessels.As is well
known, the amyloid material itself resists the action of the gastric
juice.cit._) alludes to a case in which, with waxy
degeneration of the stomach, over one hundred small ulcers were found
in different stages of development, from hemorrhagic infiltrations to
complete ulcers.Cases belonging here are reported by Fehr, _Ueber die
Amyloide Degeneration_, Inaug.Diss., Bern, 1866; Merkel, _Wiener med.Presse_, 1869; Edinger, _Deutsches Arch.568; Marchiafava, _Atti del Accad.114; and
Mattei, _Deutsche med.Zeitung_, July 5, 1883.]Finally, varicosities of the veins of the stomach have been once in a
{512} while found with gastric ulcer.In a large number, probably in
the majority, of cases of gastric ulcer no changes have been found in
the blood-vessels of the stomach except such as were manifestly
secondary to the ulcer.That gastric ulcer is frequently complicated with chronic catarrhal
gastritis has been repeatedly mentioned in the course of this article.PATHOGENESIS.--Without doubt, the most obscure chapter in the history
of gastric ulcer is that relating to its origin and to its persistence.Notwithstanding a vast amount of investigation and of discussion,
unanimity of opinion upon these subjects has not been reached.In view
of this uncertainty it is desirable in this article to do little more
than to summarize the leading theories as to the development of gastric
ulcer.Most observers are agreed that the digestive action of the gastric
juice has some share in the development and the progress of the ulcer,
but as to the first cause of the ulcer there are various hypotheses.The earliest theory refers the origin of simple ulcer of the stomach to
inflammation.Since its advocacy by Abercrombie and by Cruveilhier this
theory has always had its adherents, particularly among French writers.It is true that in stomachs which are the seat of simple ulcer
evidences of inflammation can often be found both in the neighborhood
of the ulcer and elsewhere.In recent times the supporters of the
inflammatory origin of gastric ulcer lay especial stress upon the
presence of foci of infiltration with small round cells in the mucous
and the submucous coats.[94] But it is difficult to explain by the
inflammatory theory the usually solitary occurrence and the funnel-like
shape of gastric ulcer.[Footnote 94: Laveran, _Arch.443;
Galliard, _Essai sur la Pathogenie de l'Ulcere simple de l'Estomac_,
These de Paris, 1882; Colombo, _Annali univ.The theory that gastric ulcer is of neurotic origin has also been
advocated.Some refer the origin to the secretion of an excessively
acid gastric juice under abnormal nervous influence (Gunsburg), others
to vaso-motor disturbances, and others to trophic disturbances.Wilks
and Moxon compare simple gastric ulcer to ulcers of the cornea
resulting from paralysis of the trigeminus.The neurotic theory of the
origin of gastric ulcer is altogether speculative and has never gained
wide acceptance.[95]

[Footnote 95: The first to attribute gastric ulcer to nervous influence
was Siebert (_Casper's Wochenschr.f. d. Heilk._, 1842, No.29, and
_Deutsche Klinik_, 1852).Heilk._,
xi., 1852; Wilks and Moxon, _Lect.Anat._, 2d ed., Philada.,
1875, p.Osborne in 1845 attributed gastric ulcer to the secretion
of an abnormally acid juice by a circular group of the gastric glands
(_Dublin Journ.The view which has met with the greatest favor is that which attributes
the origin of gastric ulcer to impairment or arrest of the circulation
in a circumscribed part of the wall of the stomach, and to a subsequent
solution by the gastric juice of the part thus affected.Rokitansky
first suggested this view by assigning hemorrhagic necrosis of the
mucous membrane as the first step in the formation of the ulcer; but it
is Virchow who has most fully developed this view and has given it its
main support.The first cause of gastric ulcer, according to Virchow,
is a hemorrhagic infiltration of the coats of the stomach induced by
local disturbances in the circulation.The part the nutrition of which
is thus impaired or destroyed is dissolved by the gastric juice.{513} The affections of the gastric blood-vessels to which importance
has been attached are (_a_) embolism and thrombosis; (_b_) diseases of
the coats of the vessels, as atheroma, obliterating endarteritis, fatty
degeneration, amyloid degeneration, and aneurismal and varicose
dilatations; (_c_) compression of the veins by spasm of the muscular
coats of the stomach in vomiting and in gastralgia; (_d_) passive
congestion of the stomach by obstruction in the portal circulation.In support of this view are urged the following facts: First, it has
been proven by the experiments of Pavy that parts of the gastric wall
from which the circulation has been shut off undergo digestion; second,
hemorrhagic infarctions have been observed in the stomach, both alone
(Von Recklinghausen, Hedenius) and associated with gastric ulcer (Key,
Rindfleisch); third, the hemorrhagic infiltration in the walls of
recently-formed ulcers indicates a hemorrhagic origin; fourth, the
funnel-like shape of the ulcer resembles the funnel-shaped area of
distribution of an artery; fifth, gastric ulcers have been
experimentally produced by injecting emboli into the gastric arteries
(Panum, Cohnheim).[96]

[Footnote 96: Pavy, _Philosoph.161; V.
Recklinghausen, _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.368; Axel Key, _Virchow
und Hirsch's Jahresb._, 1870, Bd.155; Rindfleisch, _Lehrb.Gewebelehre_, 5te Aufl., Leipzig, 1878; Panum, _Virchow's
Archiv_, Bd.491; Cohnheim, _Vorles.The main objections to this view are the infrequency with which the
assumed changes in the blood-vessels have been demonstrated, the common
occurrence of gastric ulcer at an age earlier than that at which
diseases of the blood-vessels are usually present, and the absence of
gastric ulcer in the vast majority of cases of heart disease, with
widespread embolism of different organs of the body.To meet some of
these objections, Klebs[97] presupposes in many cases a local spasmodic
contraction of the gastric arteries, causing temporary interruption of
the circulation; Rindfleisch and Axel Key, compression of the gastric
veins, with resulting hemorrhagic infiltration by spasm of the muscular
coat of the stomach in vomiting and in gastralgic attacks.What is actually known concerning diseases of the gastric blood-vessels
in ulcer of the stomach has already been stated under the morbid
anatomy.From this it may be inferred that the origin of gastric ulcer
in diseased conditions of the blood-vessels has been established only
for a comparatively small group of cases.Bottcher's[98] view that gastric ulcer is of mycotic origin, being
produced by micrococci, has thus far met with no confirmation.[Footnote 98: _Dorpater med.There are those who hold an eclectic view concerning the origin of
gastric ulcer.They believe that ulcer of the stomach may be produced
by a variety of causes, such as inflammation, circulatory disturbances,
irritating substances introduced into the stomach, traumatism, etc.The
peculiarities of the ulcer are due not to any specific cause, but to
the solvent action of the gastric juice, which keeps clean the floor
and the sides of the ulcer.These clean edges and floor, which are
incident to all ulcers of the stomach, justify no conclusion as to the
cause of the ulcer.Engel[99] over thirty years ago held that gastric
ulcer might {514} originate in various ways--that there was nothing
specific about it.[Footnote 99: _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, 1853, ii.]Gastric ulcers have been produced experimentally in animals in a
variety of ways, but these experiments have not materially elucidated
the pathenogenesis of ulcer in man.Schiff by lesions of various parts
of the brain, and later Ebstein by lesions of many parts of the central
and peripheral nervous system by injections of strychnine--in fact,
apparently by any means which greatly increased the
blood-pressure--produced in the stomachs of animals ecchymoses and
ulcers.Muller by ligation of the portal vein, Pavy by ligation of
arteries supplying the stomach, likewise produced hemorrhages and
ulcers.The results of Pavy could not be confirmed by Roth and others.Panum, and afterward Cohnheim, produced gastric ulcers by introducing
multiple emboli into the gastric arteries.Daettwyler under Quincke's
direction caused, in dogs with gastric fistulae, ulcers of the stomach
by various mechanical, chemical, and thermic irritants applied to the
inner surface of the stomach.Aufrecht observed hemorrhages and ulcers
in the stomachs of rabbits after subcutaneous injections of
cantharidin.[100]

Quincke, _Deutsche med.Wochenschr._, 1882, p.79; Aufrecht,
_Centralbl.The most interesting of these experiments are those of Cohnheim and of
Daettwyler, who demonstrated that in one essential point all of these
experimental ulcers differ from simple gastric ulcer in man--namely, in
the readiness with which they heal.To this ready healing the gastric
juice, much as it has been accused of causing the spread of gastric
ulcers in man, seems to have offered no obstacle.We know that similar
losses of substance in the human stomach heal equally well.[101] Hence
it has been maintained throughout this article that it is unjustifiable
to regard all of the scars found in the human stomach as the result of
simple ulcer.[Footnote 101: Portions of the mucous membrane of the stomach,
sometimes with some of the submucous coat, have been in several
instances removed with the stomach-pump, but thus far no bad effects
have followed.]It appears from these experiments, as well as from observations on man,
that it is more difficult to explain why ulcers in the stomach do not
heal than it is to understand how they may be produced.From this point
of view the observation of Daettwyler is of interest, that in dogs
which had been rendered anaemic by repeated abstraction of blood not
only did slighter irritants suffice to produce ulcers of the stomach,
but the ulcers healed much more slowly.Practically, it is important to
learn what are the obstacles to the repair of gastric ulcers, but our
positive knowledge of these is slight.It is probable that such
obstacles are to be found in constitutional causes, such as anaemia and
chlorosis, in abnormal states of the blood-vessels around the ulcer, in
catarrhal affections of the stomach, in irritating articles of food, in
improper modes of living, and in increased acidity of the gastric
juice.DIAGNOSIS.--In many cases the diagnosis of gastric ulcer can be made
with reasonable certainty; in other cases the diagnosis amounts only to
a suspicion more or less strong, and in still other cases the diagnosis
is impossible.{515} The diagnostic symptoms are epigastric pain, vomiting, and
gastric hemorrhage.The characteristics of the pain which aid in the
diagnosis are its fixation in one spot in the epigastric region, its
onset soon after eating, its dependence upon the quantity and the
quality of the food, its relief upon the complete expulsion of the
contents of the stomach, its alleviation by changes in posture, and its
increase by pressure.That the pain of gastric ulcer has not always
these characteristics has been mentioned under the Symptomatology.Vomiting without haematemesis is the least characteristic of these
symptoms.It aids in the diagnosis when it occurs after eating at the
acme of a gastralgic attack and is followed by the relief of pain.Haematemesis is the most valuable symptom in diagnosis.The more
profuse the hemorrhage and the younger the individual in whom it
occurs, the greater is the probability of gastric ulcer.It should not
be forgotten that the blood is sometimes discharged solely by the
stools.The simultaneous occurrence of all these symptoms renders the diagnosis
of gastric ulcer easy.[102] In all cases in which gastrorrhagia is
absent the diagnosis is uncertain; but gastric ulcer should be
suspected whenever the ingestion of food is followed persistently by
severe epigastric pain and other causes of the pain have not been
positively determined.When the course of the ulcer is latent and when
the symptoms are only those of dyspepsia, the diagnosis is of course
impossible.In cases previously obscure a diagnosis in extremis is
sometimes made possible by the occurrence of perforation of the
stomach.[Footnote 102: That even under the most favorable circumstances
absolute certainty in the diagnosis of gastric ulcer is not reached is
illustrated by a case reported with great precision and fulness by
Banti: A female servant, twenty-one years old, had every symptom of
gastric ulcer, including repeated haematemesis and the characteristic
epigastric pain.She died from an
ulcerative proctitis four days after the last hemorrhage from the
stomach.Only a slight catarrhal inflammation of the stomach was found
at the autopsy, without trace of ulcer, cicatrix, or ecchymosis ("Di un
Caso d'Ematemesi," _La Sperimentale_, Feb., 1880, p.It would
seem as if there must have been an ulcer which had healed so completely
as to leave no recognizable scar.]In making a differential diagnosis of gastric ulcer, as well as of any
disease, reliance should be placed more upon the whole complexion of
the case than upon any fancied pathognomonic symptoms.The diseases which are most difficult to distinguish from gastric ulcer
are nervous affections of the stomach.Like gastric ulcer, most of
these are more common in women than in men, and especially in chlorotic
women with disordered menstruation and with hysterical manifestations.These nervous affections are manifold and their leading characteristics
are not yet well defined.The most important of these affections are
nervous dyspepsia, nervous vomiting, nervous gastralgia, and gastric
crises.The leading symptoms of nervous dyspepsia, as described by Leube,[103]
are the ordinary symptoms of dyspepsia without evidence of anatomical
alteration of the stomach, and with the proof by washing out the
stomach that the process of digestion is not delayed.Nervous dyspepsia
is often associated with other nervous affections, and is caused
especially by influences which depress the nervous system.Epigastric
pain, and especially tenderness on pressure over the stomach, are not
common symptoms in nervous dyspepsia.Only those rare cases of gastric
ulcer in which hemorrhage from the stomach is absent and epigastric
pain is not prominent {516} are likely to be confounded with nervous
dyspepsia.In such cases, although the diagnosis of nervous dyspepsia
is by far the most probable, the patient may be confined to bed and put
upon the strict regimen for gastric ulcer.If in the course of ten days
or two weeks essential relief is not obtained, ulcer may be excluded,
and the proper treatment for nervous dyspepsia with tonics and
electricity may be adopted (Leube).[Footnote 103: _Deutches Arch.In nervous vomiting, which occurs most frequently in hysterical women,
other nervous manifestations are present; there are usually less
epigastric pain and tenderness than in ulcer; the nutrition is better
preserved; the vomiting is less dependent upon the ingestion of food
and more dependent on mental states; and there are longer intervals of
relief than in ulcer.Still, it may be necessary to resort to the
therapeutical diagnosis as in the preceding instance.In this connection attention may be called to the importance of
searching for reflex causes of vomiting, such as beginning phthisis,
ovarian or uterine disease, cerebral disease, and pregnancy; also to
certain cases of chronic Bright's disease in which gastric disturbances
are the main symptoms.Of all the nervous affections of the stomach, nervous gastralgia is the
one which presents the greatest similarity to gastric ulcer.Its
diagnosis from gastric ulcer is often extremely difficult, and may be
impossible.The points of difference given in the following table may
aid in the diagnosis:

elevated in gastric ulcer, but not in nervous gastralgia.Probably not a single one of the points mentioned in the table is
without exception.Nervous gastralgia may be associated with gastric
ulcer, and if the ulcer is otherwise latent the diagnosis is manifestly
impossible.A diagnosis of purely functional gastralgia has been
repeatedly overthrown by the occurrence of profuse haematemesis.There
is no symptom {517} upon which it is more unsatisfactory to base a
diagnosis than upon pain.There is much difference among physicians as
regards the frequency with which they diagnose gastric ulcer in the
class of cases here described.It is probable that the error is
oftenest a too frequent diagnosis of gastric ulcer than the reverse.Nevertheless, when there is doubt it is well to submit the patient for
a time to the proper treatment for gastric ulcer.In several instances gastric crises have been mistaken for gastric
ulcer.These gastric or gastralgic crises, as they are called by
Charcot, by whom they have been best described,[105] are most
frequently associated with locomotor ataxia, but they may occur in
connection with other diseases of the spinal cord (subacute myelitis,
general spinal paralysis, and disseminated sclerosis), and an analogous
affection has been described by Leyden[106] as an independent disease
under the name of periodical vomiting with severe gastralgic attacks.Gastric crises have been most carefully studied as a symptom in the
prodromic stage of locomotor ataxia.The distinguishing features of
these crises are the sudden onset and the atrocious severity of the
gastric pain; the simultaneous occurrence of almost incessant vomiting;
the habitual continuance of the paroxysms, almost without remission,
for two or three days; the normal performance of the gastric functions
in the intervals between the paroxysms, which may be months apart; the
frequent association with other prodromic symptoms of locomotor ataxia,
such as ocular disorders and fulgurating pains in the extremities; and
the development after a time of ataxia.Leyden has observed during the
attacks retraction of the abdomen without tension of the abdominal
walls, obstinate constipation, scanty, dark- urine, even anuria
for twenty-four hours, and increased frequency of the pulse (also noted
by Charcot).Vulpian[107] mentions a case in which there was vomiting
of dark- blood, and in which naturally the diagnosis of gastric
ulcer had been made.In the autopsies of Leyden and of Charcot no
lesions of the stomach have been found.[Footnote 107: _Maladies du Syst.The differential diagnosis of gastric ulcer from gastric cancer will be
considered in the article on GASTRIC CANCER.It has already been said that a part of the symptoms of gastric ulcer
are due to an associated chronic catarrhal gastritis.Usually other
symptoms are present which render possible the diagnosis of the ulcer.There is usually some apparent external or internal cause of chronic
catarrhal gastritis, whereas the etiology of ulcer is obscure; in
chronic gastritis gastralgic paroxysms and the peculiar fixed
epigastric pain of gastric ulcer are usually absent; in chronic
gastritis profuse haematemesis is a rare occurrence; and in gastritis
the relief obtained by rest and proper regulation of the diet, although
manifest, is usually less immediate and striking than in most cases of
gastric ulcer.The passage of gall-stones is usually sufficiently distinguished from
gastric ulcer by the sudden onset and the sudden termination of the
pain, by the situation of the pain to the right of the median line, by
the complete relief in the intervals between the attacks, by the
occurrence of jaundice, by the recognition sometimes of enlargement of
the liver and of the gall-bladder, and by the detection of gall-stones
in the feces.{518} There is not much danger of confounding abdominal aneurism and
lead colic with gastric ulcer, and the points in their differential
diagnosis are sufficiently apparent to require no description here.The
diagnosis of duodenal ulcer from gastric ulcer will be discussed
elsewhere.The different causes of gastric hemorrhage, a knowledge of
which is essential to the diagnosis of gastric ulcer, will be
considered in the article on HEMORRHAGE FROM THE STOMACH.PROGNOSIS.--Although a decided majority of simple ulcers of the stomach
cicatrize, nevertheless, in view of the frequently insidious course of
the disease, the sudden perforations, the grave hemorrhages, the
relapses, and the sequels of the disease, the prognosis must be
pronounced serious.The earlier the ulcer comes under treatment the better the prognosis.Old ulcers with thickened indurated margins containing altered
blood-vessels naturally heal with greater difficulty than
recently-formed ulcers.Profuse hemorrhage adds to the gravity of the diagnosis.It usually
indicates that the ulcer has penetrated to the serous coat of the
stomach.A hemorrhage may exert a favorable influence, in so far as to
convince the patient of the necessity of submitting to the repose and
the strict dietetic regimen which the physician prescribes.The severity of the pain is of little value as a prognostic sign.Vomiting and dyspepsia, if uncontrolled by regulation of the diet, lead
to a cachectic state which often ends in death.Little basis as there is to hope for recovery after perforation into
the general peritoneal cavity, there nevertheless have been a very few
cases in which there is reason to believe that recovery has actually
taken place after this occurrence.[108]

[Footnote 108: The most convincing case of recovery after perforation
of gastric ulcer is one reported by Hughes, Ray, and Hilton in _Guy's
Hosp.A servant-girl was suddenly seized with all
of the symptoms of perforation.Fortunately, she had eaten nothing for
four hours before the attack, and then only gruel.She was placed at
once under the influence of opium, was kept in the recumbent posture,
and was fed by the rectum.She was discharged apparently cured after
fifty-two days.Two months afterward she was again suddenly seized with
the same symptoms, and she died in fourteen hours.Shortly before the
second perforation she had eaten cherries, strawberries, and
gooseberries, which were found in the peritoneal cavity.The autopsy
showed, in addition to a recent peritonitis, evidences of an old
peritonitis.There were adhesions of the coils of the intestines with
each other and between the stomach and adjacent viscera.In the stomach
were found a cicatrix and two open ulcers, one of which had perforated.Other cases in which recovery followed after all of the symptoms of
perforation of gastric ulcer were present, but in which no subsequent
autopsy proved the correctness of the diagnosis, have been reported by
Redwood (_Lancet_, May 7, 1870); Ross (_ibid._, Jan.21, 1871); Tinley
(_ibid._, April 15, 1871); Mancini (_La Sperimentale_, 1876, pp.551,
665); and G. Johnson (_Brit.Frazer's two cases, reported in the _Dublin Hosp.Gaz._, April 15,
1861, are not convincing.The case reported by Aufrecht (_Berl.Wochenschr._, 1870, No.21) and the one by Starcke (_Deutsche Klinik_,
1870, No.39), which are sometimes quoted as examples of recovery, were
cases of circumscribed peritonitis following perforation.In an interesting case from Nothnagel's clinic reported by Luderitz,
the patient lived sixteen days after perforation into the peritoneal
cavity, followed by all of the symptoms of diffuse perforative
peritonitis.Death resulted from pneumonia secondary to the
peritonitis.At the autopsy were found adhesions over the whole
peritoneal surface and streaks of thickened pus between the coils of
intestine.The perforation in the stomach was closed by the left lobe
of the liver (_Berl.Wochenschr._, 1879, No.In estimating the prognosis one should bear in mind the possibility of
relapses; of a continuance of gastric disorders, particularly of
gastralgia, after cicatrization; of the formation of cicatricial
stenosis of {519} the orifices of the stomach; and of the development
of dilatation of the stomach.After the worst has been said concerning the unfavorable issues of
gastric ulcer, it yet remains true that the essential tendency of the
ulcer when placed under favorable conditions is toward recovery, and
that in many cases the treatment of the disease affords most excellent
results, and is therefore a thankful undertaking for the physician.TREATMENT.--In the absence of any agent which exerts a direct curative
influence upon gastric ulcer the main indication for treatment is the
removal of all sources of irritation from the ulcer, so that the
process of repair may be impeded as little as possible.Theoretically, this is best accomplished by giving to the stomach
complete rest and by nourishing the patient by rectal alimentation.Practically, this method of administering food is attended with many
difficulties, and, moreover, the nutrition of the patient eventually
suffers by persistence in its employment.In most cases the patient can
be more satisfactorily nourished by the stomach, and by proper
selection of the diet, without causing injurious irritation of the
ulcer.At the beginning of the course of treatment it is often well to
withhold for two or three days all food from the stomach and to resort
to exclusive rectal feeding.In some cases with uncontrollable vomiting
and after-hemorrhage from the stomach it is necessary to feed the
patient exclusively by the rectum.The substances best adapted for nutritive enemata are
artificially-digested foods, such as Leube's pancreatic meat-emulsion,
his beef-solution, and peptonized milk-gruel as recommended by
Roberts.[109] Beef-tea and eggs, which are often used for this purpose,
are not to be recommended, as the former has very little nutritive
value, and egg albumen is absorbed in but slight amount from the
rectum.Expressed beef-juice may also be used for rectal alimentation.The peptones, although physiologically best adapted for nutritive
enemata, often irritate the mucous membrane of the rectum, so that they
cannot be retained.It has been proven that it is impossible to
completely nourish a human being by the rectum.[110] Rectal
alimentation can sometimes be advantageously combined with feeding by
the mouth.[Footnote 109: Leube's pancreatic meat-emulsion is prepared by adding
to 4-8 ounces of scraped and finely-chopped beef l-2-1/2 ounces of
fresh finely-chopped oxen's or pig's pancreas freed from fat.To the
mixture is added a little lukewarm water until the consistence after
stirring is that of thick gruel.The syringe used to inject this
mixture should have a wide opening in the nozzle; Leube has constructed
one for the purpose (Leube, _Deutsches Arch.The milk-gruel is prepared by adding a thick, well-boiled gruel made
from wheaten flour, arrowroot, or some other farinaceous article to an
equal quantity of milk.Just before administration a dessertspoonful of
liquor pancreaticus (Benger) or 5 grains of extractum pancreatis
(Fairchild Bros.), with 20 grains of bicarbonate of soda, are added to
the enema.This may be combined with peptonized beef-tea made according
to Roberts's formula (Roberts, _On the Digestive Ferments_, p.Preparatory to beginning the treatment the bowels should be emptied by
a clyster, and this should be occasionally repeated.About three to six
ounces of the tepid nutritive fluid should be slowly injected into the
rectum.The injections may be repeated at intervals of from three to
six hours.If necessary, a few drops of laudanum may be occasionally
added to the enema.][Footnote 110: Voit u. Bauer, _Zeitschrift f. Biologie_, Bd.There is universal agreement that the dietetic treatment of gastric
ulcer is of much greater importance than the medicinal treatment.There
is {520} hardly another disease in which the beneficial effects of
proper regulation of the diet are so apparent as in gastric ulcer.Those articles of food are most suitable which call into action least
vigorously the secretion of gastric juice and the peristaltic movements
of the stomach, which do not cause abnormal fermentations, which do not
remain a long time in the stomach, and which do not mechanically
irritate the surface of the ulcer.These requirements are met only by a
fluid diet, and are met most satisfactorily by milk and by Leube's
beef-solution.The efficacy of a milk diet in this disease has been attested by long
and manifold experience.By its adoption in many cases the pain and the
vomiting are relieved, and finally disappear, and the ulcer heals.In
general, fresh milk is well borne.If not, skimmed milk may be
employed.If the digestion of the milk causes acidity, then a small
quantity of bicarbonate of soda or some lime-water (one-fourth to
one-half in bulk) may be added to the milk.Large quantities should not
be taken at once.Four ounces of milk taken every two hours are
generally well borne.Sometimes not more than a tablespoonful can be
taken at a time without causing vomiting, and then of course the milk
should be given at shorter intervals.It is desirable that the patient
should receive at least a quart, and if possible two quarts, during the
twenty-four hours.The milk should be slightly warmed, but in some
cases cold milk may be better retained.In some instances buttermilk
agrees with the patient better than sweet milk.Although many suppose
that they have some idiosyncrasy as regards the digestion of milk, this
idiosyncrasy is more frequently imaginary than real.Still, there are
cases in which milk cannot be retained, even in small quantity.For such cases peptonized milk often proves serviceable.[111] The
artificial digestion of milk as well as of other articles of food is a
method generally applicable to the treatment of gastric ulcer.The main
objection to peptonized milk is the aversion to it that many patients
acquire on account of its bitter taste.The peptonization should not be
carried beyond a slightly bitter taste.The disagreeable taste may be
improved by the addition of a little Vichy or soda-water.Peptonized
milk has proved to be most valuable in the treatment of gastric ulcer.[Footnote 111: Milk may be peptonized by adding to a pint of fresh
milk, warmed to a temperature of 100 degrees F., 5 grs.of extract
pancreatis (Fairchild Bros.sodii
dissolved in 4 ounces of tepid water.The mixture is allowed to digest
for about an hour at a temperature of 100 degrees F., which may be
conveniently done by placing the milk in a bowl in a pan of water
maintained at this temperature.It is then boiled, strained, and placed
on ice, or when the milk is to be taken immediately it is better not to
boil it, in order that the partial digestion may continue for a while
under the influence of the pancreatic ferment in the stomach.The milk
without boiling may be kept on ice without further digestion; and this
procedure has the advantage that the pancreatic ferments, although
inactive at a temperature near that of ice, are not destroyed.The
degree of digestion aimed at is indicated by the production of a
slightly, but not unpleasantly, bitter taste.When the digestion is
carried to completion, milk has a very bitter and disagreeable flavor.Peptonized milk-gruel, mentioned on page 519, may also be employed.]Leube's beef-solution[112] is a nutritious, unirritating, and
easily-digested article of diet.It can often be taken when milk is not
easily or {521} completely digested, or when milk becomes tiresome and
disagreeable to the patient.It is relied upon mainly by Leube in his
very successful treatment of gastric ulcer.A pot of the beef-solution
(corresponding to a half pound of beef) is to be taken during the
twenty-four hours.A tablespoonful or more may be given at a time in
unsalted or but slightly salted bouillon, to which, if desired, a
little of Liebig's beef-extract may be added to improve the taste.The
bouillon should be absolutely free from fat.Unfortunately, not a few
patients acquire such a distaste for the beef-solution that they cannot
be persuaded to continue its use for any considerable length of time.[Footnote 112: By means of a high temperature and of hydrochloric acid
the meat enclosed in an air-tight vessel is converted into a fine
emulsion and is partly digested.Its soft consistence, highly
nutritious quality, and easy digestibility render this preparation of
the greatest value.The beef-solution is prepared in New York
satisfactorily by Mettenheimer, druggist, Sixth Avenue and Forty-fifth
street, and by Dr.Rudisch, whose preparation is sold by several
druggists.]Freshly-expressed beef-juice is also a fairly nutritious food, which
can sometimes be employed with advantage.The juice is rendered more
palatable if it is pressed from scraped or finely-chopped beef which
has been slightly broiled with a little fresh butter and salt.The meat
should, however, remain very rare, and the fat should be carefully
removed from the juice.To the articles of diet which have been mentioned can sometimes be
added raw or soft-boiled egg in small quantity, and as an addition to
the milk crumbled biscuit or wheaten bread which may be toasted, or
possibly powdered rice or arrowroot or some of the infant farinaceous
foods, such as Nestle's.Milk thickened with powdered cracker does not
coagulate in large masses in the stomach, and is therefore sometimes
better borne than ordinary milk.For the first two or three weeks at least the patient should be
confined strictly to the bill of fare here given.Nothing should be
left to the discretion of the patient or of his friends.It is not enough to direct the patient simply to
take easily-digested food, but precise directions should be given as to
what kind of food is to be taken, how much is to be taken at a time,
how often it is to be taken, and how it is to be prepared.In all cases of any severity the patient should be treated in bed in
the recumbent posture, and warm fomentations should be kept over the
region of the stomach.Usually, at the end of two or three weeks of this diet the patient's
condition is sufficiently improved to allow greater variety in his
food.Boiled white meat of a young fowl can
now usually be taken, and agreeable dishes can be prepared with milk,
beaten eggs, and farinaceous substances, such as arrowroot, rice,
corn-starch, tapioca, and sago.Boiled calf's brain and calf's feet are allowed by Leube at this stage
of the treatment.To these articles can soon be added a very rare beefsteak made from the
soft mass scraped by a blunt instrument from a tenderloin of beef, so
that all coarse and tough fibres are left behind.This may be
superficially broiled with a little fresh butter.Boiled white fish,
particularly cod, may also be tried.It is especially important to avoid all coarse, mechanically-irritating
food, such as brown bread, wheaten grits, oatmeal, etc.; also fatty
substances, pastry, acids, highly-seasoned food, vegetables, fruit, and
all kinds of spirituous liquor.The juice of oranges and of lemons can
usually be taken.The food should not be taken very hot or very cold.For at least two or three months the patient should be confined to the
{522} easily-digested articles of diet mentioned.These afford
sufficient variety, and no license should be given to exceed the
dietary prescribed by the physician.Transgression in this respect is
liable to be severely punished by return of the symptoms.When there is
reason to believe that the ulcer is cicatrized, the patient may
gradually resume his usual diet, but often for a long time, and perhaps
for life, he may be compelled to guard his diet very carefully, lest
there should be a return of the disease.Should there be symptoms of a
relapse, the patient should resume at once the easily-digested diet
described above.Medicinal treatment of gastric ulcer, although less efficacious than
the dietetic treatment, is not to be discarded.Since its advocacy by
Ziemssen the administration of Carlsbad salts or of similarly composed
salts belongs to the systematic treatment of gastric ulcer.The objects
intended to be accomplished by the use of these salts are the daily
evacuation of the contents of the stomach into the intestine by gentle
stimulation of the gastric peristaltic movements, the neutralization of
the acid of the stomach, and the prevention of acid fermentations in
the stomach.Of these objects the most important is the prevention of
stagnation of the contents of the stomach.The chief ingredients of the
Carlsbad waters are sulphate of sodium, carbonate of sodium, and
chloride of sodium.The most important of these ingredients is sulphate
of sodium (Glauber's salts), which by exciting peristalsis propels the
gastric contents into the intestine, and thus relieves the stomach of
its burden, prevents fermentation, and removes from the surface of the
ulcer an important source of irritation.The carbonate of sodium
neutralizes the acids of the stomach, but the main value of this
ingredient and of the chloride of sodium is that in some way they
correct the action of the Glauber's salts, so that the latter may be
taken in smaller quantity and without the usual unpleasant effects of
pure Glauber's salts.[113] The artificial Carlsbad salts are to be
preferred to the natural or the artificial Carlsbad water.The natural
Carlsbad salts and much of those sold as artificial Carlsbad salts
consist almost wholly of sulphate of sodium.It is therefore best to
prescribe in proper proportion the leading ingredients of these salts.A suitable combination is sulphate of sodium five ounces, bicarbonate
of sodium two ounces, and chloride of sodium one ounce
(Leichtenstern[114]).The relative proportion of the ingredients may of
course be varied somewhat to suit individual cases.The salts are to be
taken daily before breakfast dissolved in a considerable quantity of
warm water.One or two heaping teaspoonfuls of the salts are dissolved
in one-half to one pint of water warmed to a {523} temperature of 95
degrees F. One-fourth of this is to be drunk at a time at intervals of
ten minutes.Breakfast is taken half an hour after the last draught.After breakfast there should follow one or two loose movements of the
bowels.If this is not the case, the next day the quantity of the salts
is to be increased, or if more movements are produced the quantity is
to be diminished until the desired result is obtained.In case the
salts do not operate, an enema may be used.Usually, to obtain the same
effect, the quantity of salts may be gradually diminished to a
teaspoonful.[Footnote 113: Water from the Sprudel spring contains in 16 ounces 18.2
grains of sulphate of sodium, 14.6 grains of bicarbonate of sodium, and
7.9 grains of chloride of sodium, and 11.8 cubic inches of carbonic
acid.Its natural temperature is 158 degrees F. The other Carlsbad
springs have the same fixed composition and vary only in temperature
and amount of CO_{2}.][Footnote 114: The second edition of the German Pharmacopoeia contains
a formula for making artificial Carlsbad salts, so that the ingredients
are in about the same proportion as in the natural water.The formula
is as follows: Dried sulphate of sodium 44 parts, sulphate of potassium
2 parts, chloride of sodium 18 parts, bicarbonate of sodium 36 parts.These should be mixed so as to make a white dry powder.The Carlsbad
water is imitated by dissolving 6 grammes of this salt in 1 liter of
water (_Pharmacopoeia Germanica_, editio altera, Berlin, 1882, p.According to a prescription very commonly used in Germany, the Carlsbad
salts are made by taking sulphate of sodium 50 parts, bicarbonate of
sodium 6 parts, chloride of sodium 3 parts.Dose, a teaspoonful
dissolved in one or two tumblers of warm water (Ewald u. Ludecke,
_Handb.Arzneiverordnungslehre_, Berlin, 1883, p.The Carlsbad salts are directed especially against the chronic gastric
catarrh which complicates the majority of cases of ulcer of the
stomach.It is well known that the most effective method of treating
this morbid condition is the washing out of the stomach by means of the
stomach-tube.The propriety of adopting this procedure in gastric ulcer
comes, therefore, under consideration.Although the use of the
stomach-tube in gastric ulcer is discarded by Leube and by See on
account of its possible danger, nevertheless this instrument has been
employed with great benefit in many instances of this disease by
Schliep, Debore, and others.[115] No instance of perforation of an
ulcer by means of the stomach-tube has been reported, and in general no
evil effects have resulted; but Duguet cites a case of fatal hemorrhage
following washing out of the stomach.[116] In view of the great benefit
to be secured by washing out the stomach, and of the comparatively
slight danger which attends the process, it seems justifiable to adopt
this procedure cautiously and occasionally in cases of gastric ulcer
with severe gastric catarrh.Of course only the soft rubber tube should
be used, and the siphon process should be adopted.[117] The stomach may
be washed out with pure warm water or with water containing a little
bicarbonate of sodium (one-half drachm to a quart of water).The
occasional cleansing of the stomach in this way can hardly fail to
promote the healing of the ulcer.Recent or threatened hemorrhage from
the stomach would contraindicate the use of the stomach-tube.[Footnote 115: Schliep, _Deutsch.13; Debore,
_L'Union med._, Dec.30, 1882; Bianchi, _Gaz.degli Ospitali_, March
26, 1884.]In a case of gastric
ulcer of Cornillon severe hemorrhage followed washing out the stomach
(_Le Prog.[Footnote 117: Soft rubber stomach-tubes are made by Tiemann & Co.in
New York, and are sold by most medical instrument-makers.A description
of the appropriate tube and of the method of its use is given by W. B.
Platt ("The Mechanical Treatment of Diseases of the Stomach," _Maryland
Medical Journal_, March 8, 1884).]Beyond the measures indicated there is little more to do in the way of
treatment directed toward the repair of the ulcer.Not much, if
anything, is to be expected from the employment of drugs which have
been claimed to exert a specific curative action on the ulcer.Of these
drugs those which have been held in the greatest repute are bismuth and
nitrate of silver.Trousseau[118] devised a somewhat complicated plan
for administering bismuth and nitrate of silver in succession for
several months in the treatment of gastric ulcer.There are few who any
longer cherish any faith in these drugs as curative of gastric ulcer.The same may be said of other drugs which have been thought to have
similar specific virtue in the treatment of gastric ulcer, such as
acetate of lead, arsenic, chloral hydrate, iodoform, etc.[Footnote 118: _Clinique medicale_, t. iii.{524} It remains to consider therapeutic measures which may be
necessary to combat individual symptoms of gastric ulcer.The pain of gastric ulcer is generally relieved in a few days by strict
adherence to the dietetic regimen which has been laid down.When this
is not the case, it may be best to withhold all food from the stomach
and to nourish by the rectum.But this cannot be continued long without
weakening the patient, and sometimes the pain persists in spite of the
rest afforded the stomach.Undoubtedly, the most effective means of
quieting the pain of gastric ulcer is the administration of opium in
some form.Opium should not, however, be resorted to without full
consideration of the possible consequences.When the use of this drug
is once begun, the patient is liable to become dependent upon it, and
may be inclined, consciously or unconsciously, to exaggerate the pain
in order to obtain the narcotic.When prescribing opium in this disease
the physician should have in mind the danger of establishing the opium
habit.Moreover, opium <DW44>s digestion, and is anything but an aid to
the proper dietetic regimen, which is all-important.If it is decided
to give opium, it does not matter much in what form it is administered,
but the dose should be as small as will answer the purpose.Hypodermic
injections of morphine over the region of the stomach may be
recommended.Codeia often produces less disturbance than opium or
morphine.A useful powder for the relief of pain is one containing 8 or
10 grains of subnitrate of bismuth, 1/12 grain of sulphate of morphia,
and 1/5 grain of extract of belladonna.Much of the beneficial effect
attributed to bismuth is in reality due to its customary combination
with a small quantity of morphine.Before resorting to opium in cases
of severe pain it will be well to try some of the other means for
relieving the pain of gastric ulcer, although they are less effective.Gerhardt thinks that astringents are better than narcotics to relieve
the pain of ulcer, and he recommends for the purpose three or four
drops of solution of chloride of iron diluted with a wineglassful of
water, to be taken several times daily.Although this recommendation is
from high authority and is often quoted, sufficient confirmatory
evidence of its value is lacking.Other medicines recommended are
hyoscyamus, belladonna, choral hydrate, chloric ether, hydrocyanic
acid, bismuth, nitrate of silver, and compound kino powder.Sometimes
warm fomentations, at other times a light ice-bag over the epigastrium,
afford marked relief of the pain.Counter-irritation over the region of
the stomach has also given relief.This may be effected with a mustard
plaster or by croton oil.I have known the establishment of a small
nitric-acid issue in the pit of the stomach to relieve the pain, but
such severe measures of counter-irritation are generally unnecessary.The application of a few leeches over the epigastrium has been highly
recommended, but this should be done without much loss of blood.The
effect of position of the body upon the relief of pain should be
determined.When the pain is due to flatulence or to acid fermentation
in the stomach, the treatment should be directed to those states.The most effective means of controlling the vomiting in gastric ulcer
are the regulation of the diet and, if necessary, the resort to rectal
alimentation.Whenever small
quantities of milk, peptonized or in any other form, cannot be
retained, then exclusive rectal feeding may be tried for a while.There
have been cases of gastric {525} ulcer when both the stomach and the
rectum have been intolerant of food.In such desperate cases the
attempt may be made to introduce food into the stomach by means of the
stomach-tube, for it is a singular fact that food introduced in this
way is sometimes retained when everything taken by the mouth is
vomited.[119] The cautious washing out of the stomach by the
stomach-tube may prove beneficial.In these cases the attempt has also
been made to nourish by subcutaneous injections of food.In a case of
gastric ulcer where no food could be retained either by the stomach or
by the rectum Whittaker[120] injected subcutaneously milk,
beef-extract, and warmed cod-liver oil.The
injections were continued for four days without food by the mouth or
rectum.At the best, hypodermic alimentation can
afford but slight nourishment, and is to be regarded only as a last
refuge.If there is danger of death by exhaustion, transfusion may be
resorted to.[Footnote 119: Debore, _L'Union medicale_, Dec.30, 1882, and _Gaz.des
Hop._, April 29, 1884.For this reason Debore makes extensive use of
the stomach-tube in general in feeding patients affected with gastric
ulcer.He objects to an exclusive milk diet on account of the quantity
of fluid necessary to nourish the patient, which he says amounts to
three to four quarts of milk daily.To avoid these inconveniences, he
gives three times daily drachm viss of meat-powder and drachm iiss of
bicarbonate of sodium (or equal parts of calcined magnesia and bicarb.This is to be introduced by the
stomach-tube on account of its disagreeable taste.He believes that the
addition of the large quantity of alkali prevents digestion from
beginning until the food has reached the intestine.He also gives daily
a quart of milk containing grs.Debore's
method of preparing the meat-powder is described in _L'Union medicale_,
July 29, 1882, p.He also uses a milk-powder (_ibid._, Dec.30,
1882; see also _Le Progres med._, July 12, 1884).][Footnote 120: J. T. Whittaker, "Hypodermic Alimentation," _The
Clinic_, Jan.Bernutz practised successfully in two cases the hypodermic injection of
fresh dog's blood (_Gaz.Wochenschr._, 1875, No.of
olive oil twice a day subcutaneously without causing abscesses.Menzel and Porco were the first to employ hypodermic alimentation
(_ibid._, 1869, No.Of remedies to check vomiting, first in importance are ice swallowed in
small fragments and morphine administered hypodermically.Effervescent
drinks, such as Vichy, soda-water, and iced champagne, may bring
relief.Other remedies which have been recommended are bismuth,
hydrocyanic acid, oxalate of cerium, creasote, iodine, bromide of
potash, calomel in small doses, and ingluvin.But in general it is best
to forego the use of drugs and to rely upon proper regulation of the
diet, such as iced milk taken in teaspoonful doses, and upon repose for
the stomach.Hemorrhage from the stomach is best treated by absolute rest, the
administration of bits of ice by the mouth, and the application of a
flat, not too heavy, ice-bag over the stomach.The patient should lie
as quietly as possible in the supine position, with light coverings and
in a cool atmosphere.He should be cautioned to make no exertion.His
apprehensions should be quieted so far as possible.All food should be
withheld from the stomach, and for four or five days after the
cessation of profuse hemorrhage aliment should be given only by the
rectum.There is no proof that styptics administered by the mouth have
any control over the hemorrhage, and as they are liable to excite
vomiting they may do harm.Ergotin, dissolved in water (1 part to 10),
may be injected hypodermically in grain doses several times repeated if
necessary.If internal styptics {526} are to be used, perhaps the best
are alum-whey and a combination of gallic acid 10 grains and dilute
sulphuric acid 10 drops diluted with water.Fox praises acetate of
lead, and others ergot, tannin, and Monsell's solution.If there is
vomiting or much restlessness, morphine should be given hypodermically.If the bleeding is profuse, elastic ligatures may be applied for a
short time around the upper part of one or more extremities, so as to
shut out temporarily from the circulation the blood contained in the
extremity.If syncope threatens, ammonia or a little ether may be
inhaled, or ether may be given hypodermically.Brandy, if administered,
should be given either by the rectum or hypodermically.Caution should
be exercised not to excite too vigorously the force of the circulation,
as the diminished force of the heart is an important agent in checking
hemorrhage.When life is threatened in consequence of the loss of
blood, then recourse may be had to transfusion, but experience has
shown that this act is liable to cause renewed hemorrhage in
consequence of the elevation of the blood-pressure which follows it.Transfusion is therefore indicated more for the acute anaemia after the
hemorrhage has ceased and is not likely to be renewed.It should not be
employed immediately after profuse haematemesis, unless it is probable
that otherwise the patient will die from the loss of blood, and then it
is well to transfuse only a small quantity.[121]

[Footnote 121: Michel transfused successfully in a case of extreme
anaemia following gastrorrhagia (_Berl.Wochenschr._, 1870, No.In a case of profuse and repeated haematemesis which followed
washing out the stomach Michaelis infused into the veins 350 cc.Reaction gradually followed, and the patient
recovered.This case, which was one of probable ulcer, illustrates the
advantages of infusing a small quantity (_ibid._, June 23, 1884).The
dangers are illustrated by a case reported by V. Hacker, who infused
1500 cc.of salt solution in a patient in a state of extreme collapse
resulting from hemorrhage from gastric ulcer.The patient rallied, but
he died three hours after the infusion from renewed hemorrhage (_Wiener
med.Wochenschr._, 1883, No.In Legroux's case of gastric ulcer
renewed hemorrhage and death followed the transfusion of only 80
grammes of blood (_Arch.In a case quoted
by Roussel, Leroy transfused 130 grammes of blood in a girl twenty
years old who lay at the point of death from repeated hemorrhages from
a gastric ulcer.In the following night occurred renewed hemorrhage and
death (_Gaz.According to the experiments
of Schwartz and V. Ott, the transfusion, or rather infusion, of
physiological salt solution is as useful as that of blood, and it is
simpler and unattended with some of the dangers of blood-transfusion.The formula is chloride of sodium 6 parts, distilled water 1000.]Schilling recommends, when the bleeding is so profuse that the
patient's life is threatened, to tampon the stomach by means of a
rubber balloon attached to the end of a soft-rubber stomach-tube.[122]
The external surface of the balloon is slightly oiled.It is introduced
into the stomach in a collapsed state, and after its introduction it is
moderately distended with air.When the balloon is to be withdrawn the
air should be allowed slowly to escape.Schilling tried this procedure
in one case of hemorrhage from gastric ulcer, allowing the inflated bag
to remain in the stomach twelve minutes.The hemorrhage ceased and was
not renewed.Experience only can determine whether this device, to
which there are manifest objections, will prove a valuable addition to
our meagre means of controlling hemorrhage from the stomach.[Footnote 122: F. Schilling, _Aerztl.Schreiber, in order to determine the position of the stomach, was the
first to introduce and inflate in this organ a rubber balloon
(_Deutsches Arch.Uhler recommends in
case of profuse gastric hemorrhage to pass a rubber bag into the
stomach and fill it with liquid (_Maryland Med.{527} The boldest suggestion ever made for stopping gastric hemorrhage
is that of Rydygier, who advocates in case hemorrhage from an ulcer
threatens to be fatal to cut down upon the stomach, search for the
bleeding ulcer, and then resect it.[123] Notwithstanding the great
advances made in gastric surgery during the last few years, Rydygier's
suggestion seems extravagant and unwarrantable.The most effectual treatment of the dyspepsia which is present in many
cases of gastric ulcer is adherence to the dietetic rules which have
been laid down, aided by the administration of Carlsbad salts and
perhaps in extreme cases the occasional and cautious use of the
stomach-tube.If eructations of gas and heartburn are troublesome,
antacids may be employed, but they should be given in small doses and
not frequently, as the ultimate effect of alkalies is to increase the
acid secretion of the stomach and to impair digestion.The best alkali
to use is bicarbonate of sodium, of which a few grains may be taken dry
upon the tongue or dissolved in a little water.If perforation into the peritoneal cavity occur, then opium or
hypodermic injections of morphine should be given in large doses, as in
peritonitis.Bran poultices sprinkled with laudanum or other warm
fomentations should be applied over the abdomen, although in Germany
ice-bags are preferred.Food should be administered only by the rectum.The chances of recovery are extremely slight, but the patient's
sufferings are thus relieved.In view of the almost certainly fatal
prognosis of perforation of gastric ulcer into the general peritoneal
cavity, and in view of the success attending various operations
requiring laparotomy, it would seem justifiable in these cases, after
arousing, if possible, the patient from collapse by the administration
of stimulants per rectum or hypodermically, to open the peritoneal
cavity and cleanse it with some tepid antiseptic solution, and then to
treat the perforation in the stomach and the case generally according
to established surgical methods.[124] This would be the more indicated
if it is known that the contents of the stomach at the time of
perforation are not of a bland nature.[Footnote 124: Mikulicz has successfully treated by laparotomy a case
of purulent peritonitis resulting from perforation of the intestine
with extravasation of the intestinal contents.He says that the
operation is not contraindicated by existing peritonitis if the patient
is not already in a state of collapse or sepsis.The perforation is
closed by sutures after freshening the edges of the opening (abstract
in the _Medical News_, Philada., Sept.Both Kuh and Rydygier
recommend opening the abdomen after perforation of gastric ulcer.The
borders of the ulcer are to be resected and the opening closed by
sutures (_Volkmann's Samml.It is important to maintain and to improve the patient's nutrition,
which often becomes greatly impaired from the effects of the ulcer.This indication is not altogether compatible with the all-important one
of reducing to a minimum the digestive work of the stomach.Nevertheless, some of the easily-digested articles of food which have
been mentioned are highly nutritious.By means of these and by good
hygienic management the physician should endeavor, without violating
the dietetic laws which have been laid down, to increase, so far as
possible, the strength of his patient.Starvation treatment in itself
is never indicated in gastric ulcer.Inunction of the body with oil is
useful in cases of gastric ulcer, as recommended by Pepper.[125]

[Footnote 125: _North Carolina Medical Journal_, 1880, vol.{528} In view of Daettwyler's experiments, mentioned on page 514, it is
manifestly important to counteract the anaemia of gastric ulcer.Iron,
however, administered by the mouth, disturbs the stomach and is
decidedly contraindicated during the active stage of gastric ulcer.During convalescence, only the blandest preparations of iron should be
given, and these not too soon, lest they cause a relapse.When the
indication to remove the anaemia is urgent, and especially when the
chlorotic form of anaemia exists, it may be well to try the hypodermic
method of administering iron, although this method has not yet been
made thoroughly satisfactory.Especially for the anaemia of gastric
ulcer would an efficient and unirritating preparation of iron for
hypodermic administration prove a great boon.Probably at present the
best preparation for hypodermic use is the citrate of iron, given in
one- to two-grain doses in a 10 per cent.aqueous solution, which when
used must be clear and not over a month old.The syringe and needle
shortly before using should be washed with carbolic acid.The
injections are best borne when made into the long muscles of the back
or into the nates, as recommended by Lewin for injections of corrosive
sublimate.A slight burning pain is felt for ten minutes after the
injection.This is the method employed by Quincke with good result and
without inflammatory reaction.[126] It is well to remember that
Kobert[127] has found by experiment on animals that large doses of iron
injected subcutaneously cause nephritis.Other preparations of iron
which have been recommended for hypodermic use are ferrum dialysatum
(DaCosta), ferrum pyrophosphoricum cum natr.citrico (Neuss), ferrum
pyrophosphoricum cum ammon.(Huguenin), ferrum peptonatum and
ferrum oleinicum (Rosenthal).[128] When it becomes safe to administer
iron by the stomach, then the blander preparations should be used, such
as the pyrophosphate, lactate, effervescing citrate, ferrum redactum.60, Gelatin q. s.; make 90 pills: at first one, and
afterward as many as three, of these pills may be taken three times a
day.When carefully prepared the pills are about as soft as butter.[Footnote 126: Quincke, _Deutsch.27;
Glaenecke, _Arch.[Footnote 128: DaCosta, _N.Y.290; Neuss,

1878, Nos.45-49, and 1884, Jan.Various sequels of gastric ulcer may require treatment.Cicatrization
of the ulcer is by no means always cure in the clinical sense.As the
result of adhesions and the formation and contraction of cicatricial
tissue very serious disturbances of the functions of the stomach may
follow the repair of gastric ulcer.The most important of these sequels
is stenosis of the orifices of the stomach, particularly of the pyloric
orifice.Very considerable stenosis of the pylorus may be produced
before the ulcer is completely cicatrized.In three instances a
stenosing ulcer of the pylorus has been successfully extirpated.[129]
The most important of these sequels {529} of gastric ulcer will be
treated of hereafter.Here it need only be said that during
convalescence from gastric ulcer attention to diet is all-important.For a long time the diet should be restricted to easily-digested food.The first symptoms of relapse are to be met by prompt return to bland
diet, or, if necessary, to rectal alimentation.[Footnote 129: The successful operators were Rydygier (_Berl.16, 1882), Czerny (_Arch.1), and Van Kleef (_Virchow u. Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1882, Bd.Cavazzani cut out by an elliptical incision an old
indurated ulcer of the stomach adherent to the anterior abdominal
walls.The patient died three years afterward of phthisis (_Centralbl.f. Chir._, 1879, p.Lauenstein resected the pylorus
unsuccessfully for what appears to have been an ulcer of the pylorus
with fibroid induration around it (_ibid._, 1882, No.These four
cases (three successful) are all which I have found recorded of
resection of gastric ulcer.In my opinion the resection of gastric
ulcers which resist all other methods of treatment, and especially
those which cause progressive stricture of the pylorus, is a
justifiable operation.]Ulcers of the stomach which do not belong to the category of simple
ulcer are for the most part of pathological rather than of clinical
interest.Although miliary tubercles in the walls of the stomach are more
frequent than is generally supposed, genuine tuberculous ulcers of the
stomach are not common.The most important criterion of these ulcers is
the presence of tuberculous lymphatic glands in the neighborhood, and
of miliary tubercles upon the peritoneum corresponding to the ulcer.Sometimes miliary tubercles can be discovered in the floor and sides of
the ulcer.Tuberculous gastric ulcers, when they occur, are usually
associated with tuberculous ulceration of the intestine.In an
undoubted case of tuberculous ulcer of the stomach reported by Litten,
however, this was the only ulcer to be found in the digestive
tract.[130] Tuberculous gastric ulcers generally produce no symptoms,
but they have been known to cause perforation of the stomach and
haematemesis.Many cases which have been recorded as tuberculous ulcers
of the stomach were in reality simple ulcers.Cheesy tubercles as large
as a pea, both ulcerated and non-ulcerated, have been found in the
stomach, but they are very rare.[Footnote 130: Litten, _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.Typhoid ulcers may also occur in the stomach, but they are infrequent.Both perforation of the stomach and gastrorrhagia have been caused by
typhoid ulcers, which, as a rule, however, produce no symptoms
distinctly referable to the ulcer.Syphilitic ulcers and syphilitic cicatrices of the stomach have been
described, without sufficient proof as to their being syphilitic in
origin.Necrotic ulcers, probably mycotic in origin, may be found in the
stomach in cases of splenic fever, erysipelas, pyaemia, etc.Ulceration occurring in toxic, in diphtheritic, and in phlegmonous
gastritis need not be discussed here.Follicular and catarrhal ulcers of the stomach have been described, but
without sufficient ground for separating them from hemorrhagic erosion
on the one hand and simple ulcer on the other.Hemorrhagic erosions of the stomach, to which formerly so much
importance was attached, are now believed to be without clinical
significance.They are found very frequently, and often very
abundantly, after death from a great variety of causes.{530}

CANCER OF THE STOMACH.BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.DEFINITION.--Cancer of the stomach is characterized anatomically by the
formation in this organ of a new growth, composed of a
connective-tissue stroma so arranged as to enclose alveoli or spaces
containing cells resembling epithelial cells.The growth extends by
invading the tissues surrounding it, and frequently gives rise to
secondary cancerous deposits in other organs of the body.The forms of
cancer which occur primarily in the stomach are scirrhous, medullary,
colloid, and cylindrical epithelial cancer.Rarely latent, occasionally without symptoms
pointing to the stomach as the seat of disease, gastric cancer is
usually attended by the following symptoms: loss of appetite,
indigestion, vomiting with or without admixture with blood, pain, a
tumor in or near the epigastric region, progressive loss of flesh and
strength, and the development of the so-called cancerous cachexia.The
disease is not curable.After its recognition it rarely lasts longer
than from twelve to fifteen months.SYNONYMS.--Carcinoma ventriculi; Malignant disease of the stomach.Of
the many synonyms for the special forms of cancer, the most common
are--for scirrhous, hard, fibrous; for medullary, encephaloid, soft,
fungoid; for colloid, gelatinous, mucoid, alveolar; and for cylindrical
epithelial, cylindrical-celled or cylindrical or columnar epithelioma,
cylindrical-celled cancroid, destructive adenoma.HISTORY.--Cancer of the stomach was known to the ancients only by
certain disturbances of the gastric functions which it produces.The
disease itself was not clearly appreciated until its recognition by
post-mortem examinations, which began to be made with some frequency
after the revival of medicine in the sixteenth century.During the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries several instances of gastric
cancer are recorded, the best described being those observed and
collected by Morgagni (1761).During this period scirrhus was regarded
as the type of cancerous disease.It was a common custom to call only
the ulcerated scirrhous tumors cancerous.With the awakened interest in pathological anatomy which marked the
beginning of the present century, the gross anatomical characters of
cancer and the main forms of the disease came to be more clearly
recognized.After the description of encephaloid cancer by Laennec[1]
in 1812, {531} and the first clear recognition of colloid cancer by
Otto[2] in 1816, these two forms of cancer took rank with scirrhus as
constituting the varieties of cancer of the stomach as well as of
cancer elsewhere.All that it was possible to accomplish in the
description of cancer of the stomach from a purely gross anatomical
point of view reached its culmination in the great pathological works
of Cruveilhier (1829-35) and of Carswell (1838), both of whom admirably
delineated several specimens of gastric cancer.des Sciences med._, t. i. and t.xii., Paris,
1812-15.][Footnote 2: Otto, _Seltens Beobachtungen, etc._, 1816.]During this period of active anatomical research the symptomatology of
gastric cancer was not neglected.The article on cancer by Bayle and
Cayol in the _Dictionnaire des Sciences medicales_, published in 1812,
shows how well the clinical history of gastric cancer was understood at
that period.Cylindrical-celled epithelioma of the stomach could not be recognized
as a separate form of tumor until the application of the microscope to
the study and classification of tumors--an era introduced by Muller in
1838.[3] Cylindrical-celled epithelioma of the stomach was first
recognized by Reinhardt in 1851, was subsequently described by Bidder
and by Virchow, and received a full and accurate description from
Forster in 1858.[4]

[Footnote 3: _Ueber den feineren Ban, etc., der krankh.Geschwulste_,
Berlin, 1838.][Footnote 4: Reinhardt, _Annalen d. Charite_, ii.1, 1851; Bidder,
_Muller's Archiv_, 1852, p.178; Virchow, _Gaz.de Paris_, April
7, 1855; Forster, _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.Until the publication by Waldeyer[5] in 1867 of his memorable article
on the development of cancers, it was generally accepted that gastric
cancer originated in the submucous coat of the stomach, and that the
cells in the cancerous alveoli were derived from connective-tissue
cells.Waldeyer attempted to establish for the stomach his doctrine
that all cancers are of epithelial origin.In all varieties of gastric
cancer he believed that he could demonstrate the origin of the
cancer-cells from epithelial cells of the gastric tubules--a mode of
origin which had previously been advocated for cylindrical epithelioma
by Cornil[6] (1864).Waldeyer's view has met with marked favor since
its publication, but there are eminent pathologists who have not given
adherence to it in the exclusive form advocated by its author.[Footnote 5: _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.It is somewhat remarkable that although in the early part of the
present century several monographs on gastric cancer appeared,[7] all
the more recent contributions to the subject are to be found in theses,
scattered journal articles, and text-books.Of the more recent careful
and extensive articles on cancer of the stomach, those of Lebert and of
Brinton are perhaps most worthy of mention.[8]

[Footnote 7: Chardel, Benech, Daniel, Germain, Prus, Sharpey, Barras,
etc.][Footnote 8: Lebert, _Die Krankheiten des Magens_, Tubingen, 1878;
Brinton, _Brit.ETIOLOGY.--The data for estimating the frequency of gastric cancer are
the clinical statistics of hospitals, series of recorded autopsies, and
mortuary registration reports.Statistics with reference to this point based exclusively upon the
clinical material of hospitals have only relative value, as they do not
{532} represent in proper proportion both sexes, all ages, all classes
in life, and all diseases.Statistics based upon autopsies surpass all
others in certainty of diagnosis, but they possess in even greater
degree the defects urged against hospital statistics.Not all the fatal
cases in hospitals are examined post-mortem, and gastric cancer is
among the diseases most likely to receive such examination.Hence
estimates of frequency based exclusively upon autopsies are liable to
be excessive.Estimates from mortuary registration reports, and
therefore from the diagnoses given in death-certificates, rest
manifestly upon a very untrustworthy basis as regards diagnosis, but in
other respects they represent the ideal point of view, including, as
these reports do, all causes of death among all classes of persons.It
is evident that in all methods of estimating the frequency of gastric
cancer inhere important sources of error.In general, the larger the
number of cases upon which the estimates rest the less prominent are
the errors.Such estimates as we possess are to be regarded only as
approximate, and subject to revision.From mortuary statistics Tanchou estimates the frequency of gastric
cancer as compared with that of all causes of death at 0.6 per cent.;
Virchow, at 1.9 per cent.; and D'Espine, at 2-1/2
per cent.[9]

[Footnote 9: Tanchou, _Rech.des Tumeurs du
Sein_, Paris, 1844.These statistics, which are based upon an analysis
of 382,851 deaths in the department of the Seine, are necessarily
subject to sources of error, but they do not seem to me to deserve the
harsh criticisms of Lebert and others.Virchow, _Verhandl.Wurzburg_, 1860, vol.49--analysis of 3390 deaths in Wurzburg during the years 1852-55.Wyss, quoted by Ebstein in _Volkmann's Samml.87--analysis of 4800 deaths in Zurich from 1872-74.D'Espine, _Echo medical_, 1858, vol.ii.--mortuary statistics of the
canton of Geneva, considered to be particularly accurate.]In 8468 autopsies, chiefly from English hospitals, Brinton[10] found
gastric cancer recorded in 1 per cent.Gussenbauer and
Von Winiwarter[11] found gastric cancer recorded in 1-1/2 per cent.of
the 61,287 autopsies in the Pathological Anatomical Institute of the
Vienna University.From an analysis of 11,175 autopsies in Prague, I
find gastric cancer in 3-1/2 per cent.[12]

[Footnote 10: _Loc.cit._]

[Footnote 11: _Arch.[Footnote 12: Statistics of Dittrich, Engel, Willigk, Wrany, and
Eppinger, in _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vols.vii., viii., ix., x.,
xii., xiv., xxvii., l., xciv., xcix., and cxiv.Grunfeld found in 1150
autopsies in the general hospital for aged persons in Copenhagen 102
cancers of the stomach, or 9 per cent.(_Schmidt's Jahrb._, Bd.I have collected and analyzed with reference to this point the
statistics of death from all causes in the city of New York for the
fifteen years from 1868 to 1882, inclusive.[13] I find that of the
444,564 deaths during this period, cancer of the stomach was assigned
as the cause in 1548 cases and cancer of the liver in 867 cases.Probably at least one-third of the primary cancers of the liver are to
be reckoned as gastric cancers.This would make the ratio of gastric
cancer to all causes of death about 0.4 per cent.(0.93) if only the deaths from twenty years of age
upward be taken: gastric cancer hardly ever occurs under that age.It
is probably fair to conclude that in New York not over 1 in 200 of the
deaths occurring at all ages and from all causes {533} is due to cancer
of the stomach, and that about 1 in 100 of the deaths from twenty years
of age upward is due to this cause.[Footnote 13: These statistics are obtained from the records of the
Board of Health of the city of New York.These records are kept with
great care and system.]The organs most frequently affected with primary cancer are the uterus
and stomach.In order to determine the relative frequency of cancer in
these situations, I have compiled the following table of statistics
from various sources:[14]

    Primary Cancers.-------------------------  --------------  --------------
  11,131 in Vienna           10   per cent.7,150 in New York         25.7  "   "     24.2  "   "
   9,118 in Paris (Tanchou)  25.2  "   "     32.8  "   "
   1,378 in Paris (Salle)    31.9  "   "     32    "   "
     587 in Berlin           35.8  "   "     25    "   "
     183 in Wurzburg         34.9  "   "     19    "   "
   1,046 in Prague           37.6  "   "     33.3  "   "
     889 in Geneva           45    "   "     15.6  "   "
  ------                     ----            ----
  31,482 total               21.4 per cent.From this table it appears that in some collections of cases the uterus
is the most frequent seat of primary cancer, while in other collections
the stomach takes the first rank.If the sum-total of all the cases be
taken, the conclusion would be that about one-fifth of all primary
cancers are seated in the stomach, and somewhat less than one-third in
the uterus.Even if allowance be made for the apparently too low
percentage of cases of gastric cancer in the large Vienna
statistics,[15] I should still be inclined to place the uterus first in
the list of organs most frequently affected with primary cancer, and to
estimate the frequency of gastric cancer compared with that of primary
cancer elsewhere as not over 25 per cent.[Footnote 14: Vienna cases: Gurlt, _Arch.421--statistical analysis of 16,637 tumors observed in the three large
hospitals of Vienna from 1855 to 1878.New York cases: see preceding
foot-note.Paris cases: Tanchou, _op.cit._, and Salle, _Etiologie de
la Carcinose_, These, Paris, 1877, p.145 _et seq._--fatal cases in
Paris hospitals, 1861-63.Berlin cases: Lange, _Ueber den Magenkrebs_,
Inaug.Diss., Berlin, 1877--post-mortem material.Wurzburg cases:
Virchow, _loc.cit._, and _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.Prague
cases: reference given above--post-mortem material.Geneva cases:
D'Espine, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 15: That this percentage is too low is apparent from the fact
that the number of cases of gastric cancer is only twice that of
primary cancer of liver in Gurlt's statistics.]The liability to gastric cancer seems to be the same in both sexes.Of
2214 cases of gastric cancer which I have collected from hospital
statistics, and which were nearly all confirmed by autopsy, 1233 were
in males and 981 in females.[16] This makes the ratio of males to
females about 5 to 4.This difference is so slight that no importance
can be attached to it, especially in view of the fact that in most
hospitals the males are in excess of the females.[Footnote 16: My statistics regarding sex are obtained from _Prager
Vierteljahrschr._, vols.xvii., l., xciv., xcix., cxiv.cit._; Katzenellenbogen, _Beitr.zur Statistik d. Magencarcinoms_,
Jena, 1878; Leudet, _Bull.564; Gussenbauer and
V. Winiwarter, _loc.cit._; Habershon, _Diseases of
Abdomen_, Philada., 1879; and _Ann.zu
Munchen_, Bd.If to these accurate statistics be added collections of cases from
heterogeneous sources, including mortuary statistics (Brinton, Louis,
D'Espine, Virchow, Gurlt, Welch), there results a total of 5426 cases,
with 2843 males and 2583 females, the two sexes being more evenly
represented than in the more exact statistics given in the text.In
this collection of cases Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter's cases only up
to the year 1855 are included, as the subsequent ones are doubtless in
great part included in Gurlt's statistics.According to Brinton,
gastric cancer is twice as frequent in males as in females.]{534} The following table gives the age in 2038 cases of gastric cancer
obtained from trustworthy sources and arranged according to
decades:[17]

   Age.------      ----------------  ---------
  10-20.2           0.1
  20-30.55           2.7
  30-40.271          13.3
  40-50.499          24.5
  50-60.620          30.4
  60-70.428          21
  70-80.140           6.85
  80-90.20           1
  90-100.2           0.1
  Over 100.1           0.05

From this analysis we may conclude that three-fourths of all gastric
cancers occur between forty and seventy years of age.The absolutely
largest number is found between fifty and sixty years, but, taking into
consideration the number of those living, the liability to gastric
cancer is as great between sixty and seventy years of age.Nevertheless, the number of cases between thirty and forty years is
considerable, and the occurrence of gastric cancer even between twenty
and thirty is not so exceptional as is often represented, and is by no
means to be ignored.The liability to gastric cancer seems to lessen
after seventy years of age, but here the number of cases and the number
of those living are so small that it is hazardous to draw positive
conclusions.[Footnote 17: The sources of the statistics for age are--Dittrich
(160), _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vol.; D'Espine (117), _loc.cit._; Virchow (63), _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.429; Leudet (69),
_loc.cit._; Lange (147), _op.cit._; Katzenellenbogen (60), _op.cit._; Gussenbauer and Von Winiwarter (493 cases up to 1855), _loc.cit._; Lebert (314), _op.cit._; Habershon (76), _op.cit._; Gurlt
(455), _loc.The results correspond
closely to those of the smaller statistics of Brinton and of Lebert.]Cancer of the stomach in childhood is among the rarest of diseases.Steiner and Neureutter[18] failed to find a single gastric cancer in
2000 autopsies on children.Cullingworth[19] has reported with
microscopical examination a case of cylindrical-celled epithelioma in a
male infant dying at the age of five weeks; it is probable that the
tumor was congenital.It is not certain whether Wilkinson's[20]
often-quoted case of congenital scirrhus of the pylorus in an infant
five weeks old was a cancer or an instance of simple hypertrophy.Kaulich[21] cites a case of colloid cancer affecting the stomach,
together with nearly all the abdominal organs, in a child a year and a
half old, but whether the growth in the stomach was primary or
secondary is not mentioned.The case which Widerhofer[22] has reported
as one of cancer of the stomach secondary to cancer of the
retro-peritoneal glands in an infant sixteen days old seems from the
description to be sarcoma.Scheffer[23] has reported a case of large
ulcerated encephaloid cancer of the fundus, involving the spleen, in a
boy fourteen years old.Jackson[24] has reported an interesting case of
encephaloid cancer in a boy fifteen years old in whom no evidence of
disease existed up {535} to ten weeks before death.These cases, which
are all that I have been able to find in children, are to be regarded
as pathological curiosities.[25]

Boston Society for Medical Improvement_, vol.[Footnote 25: Mathien (_Du Cancer precoce de l'Estomac_, Paris, 1884)
has recently analyzed, chiefly from a clinical point of view, 27 cases
of gastric cancer occurring under thirty-four years of age.Of these, 3
were under twenty and 14 were between twenty and thirty years.He also
emphasizes the error of considering cancer of the stomach as
exclusively a disease of advanced life.]Such statistics as we possess would make it appear that gastric cancer,
as well as cancer in general, is somewhat less common in the United
States than in the greater part of Europe.[26] These statistics,
however, are too inaccurate, and the problems involved in their
interpretation are too complex, to justify us in drawing any positive
conclusions as to this point.It is certain that cancer is not a rare
disease in the United States.[Footnote 26: Of 1000 deaths in New York in 1882, 19.3 were from
cancer.The statistics on this point from some of the large European
cities are--Geneva, 53 deaths from cancer per mille; Frankfort, 47.6;
Copenhagen, 33.2; Christiania, 29; London, 28.7; Paris, 27; Edinburgh,
25.4; Berlin, 22.4; St.Petersburg, 15; Amsterdam, 12.These statistics
are obtained from the _Forty-fourth Annual Report of the
Registrar-General (for 1881)_, London, 1883; from _Preussische
Statistik_, Heft lxiii., Berlin, 1882; and from _Traite de la
Climatologie medicale_, Paris, 1877-80, by Lombard, in whose excellent
work will be found much information on this subject.To judge from statistics in this country and in England, the death-rate
from cancer is undergoing a rapid annual increase.Whereas in New York
in 1868 this death-rate was only 12.6 per mille, in 1882 it was 19.3.In England and Wales in 1858 the deaths from cancer per 1,000,000
persons living were 329, and in 1881 they were 520.It seems probable,
as suggested in the above report of the Registrar-General, that this
apparently increasing large death-rate is due to increased accuracy in
diagnosis.It may be also that decrease in infant mortality and
prolongation of life by improved sanitary regulations may account in
part for this increase.From this point of view Dunn makes the
paradoxical statement that the cancer-rate of a country may be accepted
as an index of its healthfulness (_Brit.Journ._, 1883, i.).]It is said on good authority that in Egypt and Turkey gastric cancer
and other forms of cancer are infrequent.[27] A similar infrequency has
been claimed for South America, the Indies, and in general for tropical
and subtropical countries; but all of these statements as to the
geographical distribution of cancer are to be accepted with great
reserve, as they do not rest upon sufficient statistical information.[Footnote 27: Hirsch, _Handb.d. Historisch-geographische Pathologie_,
Bd.379, Erlangen, 1862-64.]I have analyzed the frequency of gastric cancer among <DW64>s upon a
basis of 7518 deaths among this race in New York, and I find the
proportion of deaths from this cause about one-third less than among
white persons.[28] It has been stated that cancer is an extremely rare
disease among <DW64>s in Africa.[29] The admixture with white blood
makes it difficult to determine to what degree pure <DW64>s in this
country are subject to cancer.[Footnote 28: According to the Ninth Census Report of the United
States, in the census year 1870 the deaths from cancer among white
persons were 13.7 per mille, and among <DW52> persons only 5.7 per
mille; but it is well known that the registration returns upon which
the vital statistics in these reports are based are very incomplete and
unsatisfactory.][Footnote 29: Bordier, _La Geographie medicale_, Paris, 1884, p.Livingstone speaks of the infrequency of cancer among the <DW64>s in
Africa.]The question as to what role is played by heredity in the causation of
gastric cancer belongs to the etiological study of cancer in general.of the cases of cancer it can be
determined that other members of the family are or have been affected
with the disease.[30] {536} The influence of inheritance, therefore, is
apparent only in a comparatively small minority of the cases.As
suggested long ago by Matthew Baillie, this hereditary influence is
better interpreted as in favor of a local predisposition (embryonic
abnormality?)in the organ or part affected than in favor of the
inheritance of a cancerous diathesis.It has been claimed by D'Espine,
Paget, and others that cancer develops at an earlier age when there is
a family history of the disease than when such history is absent.[Footnote 30: This statement is based upon the collection of 1744 cases
of cancer analyzed with reference to this question.Of these, a family
history of cancer was determined in 243 cases.The cases are obtained
from statistics of Paget and Baker, Sibley, Moore, Cooke, Lebert,
Lafond, Hess, Leichtenstern, Von Winiwarter, and Oldekop.There is
extraordinary variation in the conclusions of different observers upon
this point.Velpeau asserted that he could trace hereditary taint in 1
in 3 cancerous subjects; Paget, in 1 in 4; Cripps, in 1 in 28.My
conclusions agree with those obtained at the London Cancer Hospital
(Cooke, _On Cancer_, p.The most remarkable instance of inherited cancer on record is reported
by Broca (_Traite des Tumeurs_, vol.151, Paris, 1866): 15 out of
26 descendants over thirty years of age of a woman who died in 1788 of
cancer of the breast were likewise affected with cancer.As is well
known, Napoleon the First, his father, and his sister died of cancer of
the stomach.]It may be considered established that cancer sometimes develops in a
simple ulcer of the stomach, either open or cicatrized.It is most
likely to develop in large and deep ulcers with thickened edges, where
complete closure by cicatrization is very difficult or impossible.It
is difficult to prove anatomically that a gastric cancer has developed
from an ulcer, and hence such statements as that of Eppinger, that in
11.4 per cent.of cancers of the stomach this mode of development
existed, are of no especial value.[31] No etiological importance can be
attached to the occasional association of cancer with open or
cicatrized simple ulcers in different parts of the same stomach.Of the
comparatively few cases in which strict anatomical proof has been
brought of the origin of cancer in simple gastric ulcer, probably the
most carefully investigated and conclusive is one studied and reported
by Hauser.[32] It is, however, by no means proven that Hauser's view is
correct, that cancer develops from the atypical epithelial growths
often to be found in the cicatricial tissue of gastric ulcer.In a few
instances both the clinical history and the anatomical appearances
speak decisively for the development of cancer in a simple gastric
ulcer;[33] and the establishment of this fact is of clinical
importance.[Footnote 31: _Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vol.[Footnote 32: _Das chronische Maqengeschwur_, Leipzig, 1883, p.See
also Heitler, "Entwicklung von Krebs auf narbigen Grunde in Magen,"
_Wien.Wochenschr._, 1883, p.It seems to me that at present
there is a tendency to exaggerate the frequency with which cancer
develops from gastric ulcer.][Footnote 33: A particularly satisfactory case of this kind is reported
by Lebert, _op.Many other factors in the causation of gastric cancer have been
alleged, but without proof of their efficacy.This is true of chronic
gastritis, which was once thought to be an important cause of gastric
cancer, and is even recently admitted by Leube to be of influence.[34]
Certainly the majority of cases of cancer of the stomach are not
preceded by symptoms of chronic gastritis.Although in a few instances
gastric cancer has followed an injury in the region of the stomach,
there is no reason to suppose that this was more than a coincidence.[Footnote 34: In _Ziemssen's Handb.Few, if any, at present believe that depressing emotions, such as
grief, anxiety, disappointment, which were once considered important
causes of cancer, exert any such influence.Cancer of the stomach
occurs as {537} frequently in those of strong as in those of weak
constitution--as often among the temperate as among the intemperate.If, as has been claimed (D'Espine), gastric cancer is relatively more
frequent among the rich than among the poor, this is probably due only
to the fact that a larger number of those in favorable conditions of
life attain the age at which there is greatest liability to this
disease.No previous condition of constitution, no previous disease, no
occupation, no station in life, can be said to exert any causative
influence in the production of gastric cancer.It will be observed that the obscurity which surrounds the ultimate
causation of gastric cancer is in no way cleared up by the points which
have been here considered and which are usually considered under the
head of etiology.It is impossible to avoid the assumption of an
individual--and in my opinion a local--predisposition to gastric
cancer, vague as this assumption appears.All other supposed causes are
at the most merely occasional or exciting causes.The attempts to
explain in what this predisposition consists are of a speculative
nature, and will be briefly considered in connection with the
pathenogenesis of gastric cancer.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--We may distinguish the following groups of cases of
gastric cancer:

First: Latent cases, in which the cancer of the stomach has produced no
symptoms up to the time of death.Many secondary cancers of the stomach
belong to this class.Here also belong cases in which a cancer is found
unexpectedly in the stomach when death has resulted from other causes.I have found a medullary cancer, slightly ulcerated, as large as a
hen's egg, seated upon the posterior wall and lesser curvature of the
stomach of a laboring man suddenly killed while in apparent health and
without previous complaint of gastric disturbance.These cases, in
which life is cut short before any manifestation of the disease, are
without clinical significance, save to indicate how fallacious it is to
estimate the duration of the cancerous growth from the first appearance
of the symptoms.Second: Cases in which gastric symptoms are absent or insignificant,
whereas symptoms of general marasmus or of progressive anaemia or of
cachectic dropsy are prominent.Cases of this class are frequently
mistaken for pernicious anaemia, and occasionally for Bright's disease,
heart disease, or phthisis.It is difficult to explain in these cases
the tolerance of the stomach for the cancerous growth, but this
tolerance is most frequently manifested when the tumor does not invade
the orifices of the organ.Third: Cases in which the symptoms of the primary gastric cancer are
insignificant, but the symptoms of secondary cancer, particularly of
cancer of the liver or of the peritoneum, predominate.In some, but not
in all, of these cases the primary growth is small or has spared the
orifices of the stomach.Fourth: Cases in which the symptoms point to some disease of the
stomach, or at least to some abdominal disease; but the absence of
characteristic symptoms renders the diagnosis of gastric cancer
impossible or only conjectural.Fifth: Typical cases in which symptoms sufficiently characteristic of
{538} gastric cancer are present, so that the diagnosis can be made
with reasonable positiveness.It is not to be understood that these groups represent sharply-drawn
types of the disease.It often happens that the same case may present
at one period the features of one group, and at another period those of
another group.Nor is it supposed that every exceptional and erratic
case of gastric cancer can be classified in any of the groups which
have been mentioned.[35]

[Footnote 35: In the thesis of Chesnel may be found many curious
clinical disguises which may be assumed by cancer of the stomach, such
as simulation of Bright's disease, heart disease, phthisis, chronic
bronchitis, cirrhosis of the liver, etc.(_Etude clinique sur le Cancer
latent de l'Estomac_, Paris, 1877).Annals Albany_, 1883,
p.207) reports a case of gastric cancer in which extra-uterine
foetation was suspected.]A typical case of gastric cancer runs a course about as follows: A
person, usually beyond middle age, begins to suffer from disordered
digestion.His appetite is impaired, and a sense of uneasiness,
increasing in course of time to actual pain, is felt in the stomach.These symptoms of dyspepsia are in no way peculiar, and probably at
first occasion little anxiety.It is, however, soon observed that the
patient is losing flesh and strength more rapidly than can be explained
by simple indigestion.Vomiting, which was usually absent at first, makes its
appearance and becomes more and more frequent.After a while it may be
that, without any improvement, the vomiting becomes less frequent,
comes on longer after a meal, but is more copious.In the later periods
of the disease a substance resembling coffee-grounds and consisting of
altered blood is often mingled with the vomit.By this time the patient
has assumed a cachectic look.He is wasted, and his complexion has the
peculiar pale yellowish tint of malignant disease.Perhaps there is a
little oedematous pitting about the ankles.During the progress of the
disease in the majority of cases an irregular hard tumor can be felt in
the epigastrium.While one or another of the symptoms may abate in
severity, the general progress of the disease is relentlessly downward.Within six months to two years of the onset of the symptoms the patient
dies of exhaustion.Too much stress should not be laid upon any so-called typical course of
gastric cancer.This course is modified by many circumstances, such as
the situation of the cancer, its size, its rapidity of growth, the
presence or absence of ulceration, the existence or non-existence of
secondary tumors, the presence of complications, and the individuality
of the patient.It is necessary, therefore, to consider in detail each
of the important symptoms of gastric cancer.But in thus fixing
attention upon individual symptoms one must not lose sight of the
clinical picture as a whole.It is not any single symptom which is
decisive; it is rather the combination, the mode of onset, and the
course of the symptoms, which are of most importance in diagnosis.Impairment of the appetite is the rule in gastric cancer.Anorexia is
sometimes a marked symptom before pain, vomiting, and other evidences
of gastric indigestion are noted.There is often a special distaste for
meat.The appetite may be capricious; it is very rarely even increased.There are exceptional cases in which the appetite is preserved
throughout the greater part or even the whole course of the disease.This seems to {539} be more frequent with cancer of the cardia than
with cancer of other parts of the stomach.Loss of appetite is a much
more common symptom in gastric cancer than in gastric ulcer.In cancer,
as well as in ulcer, the patient sometimes refrains from food less on
account of disrelish for it than on account of the distress which it
causes him.Pain is one of the most frequent symptoms of cancer of the stomach.If
the pain begins early in the disease, and continues, as it often does,
with increasing severity, it renders gastric cancer one of the most
distressing affections.The pain is usually felt in the epigastrium,
but it may be more intense in the hypochondria.It is sometimes felt in
the interscapular region, the shoulders, or even in the loins.[36] With
cancer of the cardia it is often referred to the point of the xiphoid
cartilage or behind the sternum.In general, however, there is so
little correspondence between the site of the cancer and the exact
locality of the pain that no weight can be attached to the situation of
the pain in diagnosing the region of the stomach involved in the
growth.Nor does any import attach to the quality of the pain, whether
it is described as burning, gnawing, dull, lancinating, etc.Severe
gastralgic paroxysms occur, although less frequently than in gastric
ulcer.[Footnote 36: The pain in cases of gastric cancer may be felt in parts
of the body remote from the stomach.Thus, in a case of cancer of the
cardia reported by Minot the pain was felt, not in the epigastrium, but
in the left shoulder, the back of the neck, and the pharynx.In several
instances the pain has been interpreted as of renal origin.In a case
of gastric cancer reported by Palmer each attack of vomiting was
invariably preceded by pain in the middle of the shaft of the left
humerus (_Extr.The pain is usually aggravated by ingestion of food, although it may
not become severe until the process of digestion is far advanced.Pain,
however, occurs independently of taking food, and is occasionally a
marked symptom when there are no evidences of dyspepsia.There can be
no doubt that the cancer, as such, produces pain by involvement of the
nerves of the stomach, but there is no specific cancerous pain, such as
has been described by Brinton and other writers.There is usually
tenderness on pressure over the stomach, and this tenderness is often
over the tumor, if such can be felt.In general, it may be said that the pain of gastric cancer, as
contrasted with that of simple gastric ulcer, is often less dependent
upon taking food, less intense, less circumscribed, less paroxysmal,
less often relieved by vomiting; but there is so little constancy about
any of these points that no reliance is to be placed upon any
peculiarity of the pain in the diagnosis of gastric cancer.The observation of several cases of gastric cancer without pain as a
marked symptom leads me to emphasize the fact that absence or trifling
severity of pain throughout the greater part or the whole of the
disease, although exceptional, is not extremely rare.The frequency of
painless gastric cancers is given by Lebert as 25 per cent., and by
Brinton as 8 per cent., of the whole number.For many reasons,
numerical computations as to the frequency of this and of other
symptoms of gastric cancer are of very limited value.[37] Absence of
pain is more common in {540} gastric cancers of old persons and in
cancers not involving the orifices of the stomach than it is at an
earlier period of life or when the gastric orifices are obstructed.[Footnote 37: Gastric cancer cannot be considered as a disease with
uniform characters.It is irrational to group together cancers of the
pylorus, of the cardia, of the fundus, of the curvatures, cancers hard
and soft, ulcerated and not ulcerated, infiltrating and circumscribed,
and to say that pain or vomiting is present in so-and-so many cases of
cancer of the stomach.There is not a sufficient number of recorded
cases in which the symptoms are fully described with reference to the
peculiarities of the growth to enable us to apply to gastric cancer the
numerical method of clinical study with valuable results.The great
discrepancy between Lebert's and Brinton's statistics as to the
frequency of painless cancers of the stomach illustrates the present
inadequacy of the numerical method, which is misleading in so far as it
gives a false appearance of exactness.]The functions of the stomach are almost invariably disordered in
gastric cancer.Sometimes, especially in the early stages, this
disorder is only moderate, and is manifested by the milder symptoms of
indigestion, such as uneasy sensations of weight and fulness after a
meal, nausea, flatulent distension of the stomach relieved by
eructation of gases, and heartburn.With the progress of the disease
the uneasy sensations become actually painful; watery fluids, and
sometimes offensive acrid fluids and gases, are regurgitated; and
nausea culminates in vomiting.The
eructation of inflammable gases has been observed in a few cases.The most troublesome symptoms of indigestion occur with those cancers
which by obstructing the pyloric orifice lead to dilatation of the
stomach.Cases of gastric cancer in which the distressing symptoms of
dilatation of the stomach dominate the clinical history are frequent.These symptoms are in no way peculiar to cancer of the stomach, but
belong to dilatation produced by pyloric stenosis from whatever cause,
and will be described in the article on DILATATION OF THE STOMACH.Various causes combine to impair the normal performance of the gastric
functions in cancer of the stomach.Chronic catarrhal gastritis is a
factor in not a few cases.The destruction by the cancer of a certain
amount of secreting surface can be adduced as a sufficient cause only
in exceptional cases of extensive cancerous infiltration.Of more
importance is interference with the peristaltic movements of the
stomach, particularly in the pyloric region, where the cancer is most
frequently situated.As already mentioned, dilatation of the stomach is
a most important cause of indigestion in many cases.Of great interest
in this connection is the discovery by Von den Velden[38] that as a
rule (to which there are exceptions) the gastric juice in cases of
dilatation of the stomach due to cancer contains no free hydrochloric
acid, and that this gastric juice has comparatively feeble digestive
power, as proven by experiments.As this alteration of the gastric
juice interferes particularly with the digestion of albuminous
substances, it is explicable why many patients with gastric cancer have
an especial abhorrence for meat.[Footnote 38: _Deutsches Arch.During the progress of the disease the dyspeptic symptoms may improve,
but this improvement is usually only temporary.In exceptional cases of
gastric cancer dyspeptic symptoms, as well as other gastric symptoms,
may be absent or not sufficiently marked to attract attention.Hiccough, sometimes very troublesome, has been observed not very
infrequently during the later periods of the disease.There is nothing noteworthy about the appearance of the tongue, which
is often clean and moist, but may be furred or abnormally red and dry.In the cachectic stage, toward the end of the disease, aphthous patches
{541} often appear on the tongue and buccal mucous membrane.An
increased flow of saliva has been occasionally observed in gastric
cancer as well as in other diseases of the stomach.Thirst is present
when there is profuse vomiting.Vomiting usually appears after other symptoms of indigestion have been
present for some time.It may, however, be one of the earliest symptoms
of the disease.At first of occasional occurrence, it increases in
frequency until in some cases it becomes the most prominent of all
symptoms.Vomiting may occur in paroxysms which last for several days
or weeks, and then this symptom may improve, perhaps to be renewed
again and again, with remissions of comparative comfort.There are rare
cases of gastric cancer in which the first symptom to attract attention
is uncontrollable vomiting, accompanied often with pain and rapid
emaciation.Such cases may run so acute a course that a fatal
termination is reached within one to two months.[39] In these cases,
which have been interpreted as acutely-developed gastric cancers, it is
probable that the cancer has remained latent for weeks or months before
it gave rise to marked symptoms.[Footnote 39: For example, Andral relates a case in which death took
place thirty-seven days after the onset of the symptoms, these being
obstinate vomiting, severe gastralgic paroxysms, marasmus, and, about
ten days before death, profuse black vomit.There was found a fungoid
tumor the size of a hen's egg projecting into the cavity of the stomach
near the pylorus.In this situation the walls of the stomach were
greatly thickened by colloid growth (_Arch.Here may also be mentioned the fact that in several instances pregnancy
has been complicated with gastric cancer.Here the uncontrollable
vomiting which often exists has been referred to the pregnancy, and has
led to the production of premature labor.]The situation of the cancer exerts great influence upon the frequency
of vomiting and the time of its occurrence after meals.When the cancer
involves the pyloric orifice, vomiting is rarely absent, and generally
occurs an hour or more after a meal.As this is the most frequent
situation of the cancer, it has been accepted as a general rule that
vomiting occurs at a longer interval after eating in cases of gastric
cancer than in cases of simple ulcer.But even with pyloric cancer the
vomiting may come on almost immediately after taking food, so that it
is not safe to diagnose the position of the cancer by the length of
time between eating and the occurrence of vomiting.As the cancer in
its growth obstructs more and more the pyloric orifice, the vomiting
acquires the peculiarities of that accompanying dilatation of the
stomach.The vomiting comes on longer after a meal--sometimes not until
twelve or twenty hours or even more have elapsed.It may be that
several days elapse between the acts of vomiting, which then present a
certain periodicity.The patient then vomits enormous quantities
containing undigested food, mucus, sarcinae, and gaseous and other
products of fermentation.Sometimes, especially toward the end of the
disease, the vomiting ceases altogether.This cessation has been
attributed to reopening of the pyloric orifice by sloughing of the
growth.It is not necessary to assume such an occurrence, as a similar
cessation of vomiting sometimes occurs in dilatation of the stomach due
to persistent stenosis of the pylorus.Cessation of vomiting in these
cases is by no means always a favorable symptom.Next to pyloric cancer, it is cancer involving the cardiac orifice
which is most frequently accompanied by vomiting.Here the vomiting
occurs often immediately after taking food, but there are exceptions to
this rule.{542} If in consequence of stenosis of the cardiac orifice
the food does not enter the stomach, it is shortly regurgitated
unchanged or mingled simply with mucus.It is this regurgitation rather
than actual vomiting which in most common and characteristic of cardiac
cancer.Even in cases in which the passage of an oesophageal sound
reveals no obstruction at the cardiac orifice it sometimes happens that
food, including even liquids, is regurgitated almost immediately, as in
a case reported by Ebstein in which cold water was returned at once
after swallowing.[40] In these cases Ebstein with great plausibility
refers the regurgitation to reflex spasm of the oesophagus induced by
irritation of a cancer at or near the cardia through contact of food or
liquids, especially when cold, with its surface.[Footnote 40: "Ueber den Magenkrebs," _Volkmann's Samml.When the cancer is seated in other parts of the stomach and it does not
obstruct the orifices, vomiting is more frequently absent or of only
rare occurrence.Vomiting is absent, according to Lebert, in one-fifth,
according to Brinton in about one-eighth, of the cases of gastric
cancer.Absence of vomiting is sufficiently frequent in gastric cancer
to guard one against excluding the diagnosis of this disease on this
ground alone.Although in many cases the vomiting of gastric cancer can be explained
on mechanical grounds by stenosis of the orifices, this is an
explanation not applicable to all cases.Mention has already been made
of spasm of the oesophagus as a cause of regurgitation of food in some
cases of cardiac cancer.A similar spasm of the muscle in the pyloric
region may explain the vomiting in certain cases in which during life
there were symptoms of pyloric stenosis, but after death no or slight
stenosis can be found.There is reason also to believe that atony of
the muscular coats of the stomach may cause stagnation of the contents
of the stomach and dilatation of the organ.In exceptional cases of
gastric cancer in which the stomach is so intolerant as to reject food
almost immediately after its entrance a special irritability of the
nerves of the stomach must be assumed.It is customary to refer this
form of vomiting to irritation of the ulcerated surface of the cancer
by analogy with a similar irritability of the stomach observed in some
cases of simple gastric ulcer.But there is little analogy between the
ulcerated surface of a cancer in which tissues of little vitality and
irritability are exposed and the surface of a simple ulcer in which the
normal or slightly altered tissues of the stomach are laid bare.Finally, in the existence of chronic catarrhal gastritis is to be found
another cause of vomiting in many cases of gastric cancer.The presence of fragments of the cancer in the contents removed by
washing out the stomach with the stomach-tube has been observed by
Rosenbach[41] in three cases of gastric cancer, and utilized for
diagnostic purposes.A cancerous structure could be made out in these
fragments by the aid of the microscope.Hitherto, the presence of
particles of the tumor in the vomited matter has been considered as
hardly more than a curiosity, and I have not been able to find a
well-authenticated instance in which such particles in the vomit have
been recognized by microscopical examination.According to Rosenbach,
the fragments of the tumor in the washings from the stomach can be
recognized by the naked eye by the red, reddish-brown, or black specks
on their surface, due to recent or old hemorrhages which have aided in
the detachment of the fragments.{543} By this means such particles are
distinguished macroscopically from bits of food.By employing
soft-rubber tubes and the syphon process there is no danger, in washing
out of the stomach, of detaching pieces of the normal mucous membrane,
which, moreover, can be distinguished from the fragments of the tumor
by the aid of the microscope and usually by the naked eye.It remains
to be seen how frequently such fragments of the tumor are to be found
in the fluids obtained by washing out the stomach.It is not probable
that they will be found so often as Rosenbach anticipates.According to
the experience of most observers, they are very rarely present.They
would naturally be most readily detached from soft, fungoid, and
ulcerating cancerous growths.In this connection may also be mentioned
the occasional separation of bits of the tumor by the passage of the
stomach-tube in cases of cancer of the cardia.The eye of the tube as
well as the washings from the stomach should be carefully examined for
such particles.Wochenschr._, 1882, p.The habitual absence of free hydrochloric acid in the gastric fluids in
dilatation of the stomach due to carcinoma of this organ was noted by
Von der Velden.[42] He found in eight cases of dilatation due to cancer
of the pylorus that the fluids removed by the stomach-pump were free
from hydrochloric acid, whereas in ten cases of dilatation due to other
causes, such as cicatrized simple ulcer of the pylorus, free
hydrochloric acid was only temporarily absent from the gastric juice.Von der Velden therefore attributes to the presence or the absence of
free hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice in these cases great
diagnostic importance.The observations which have followed Von der
Velden's publication are not yet sufficient to justify us in drawing
positive conclusions in this matter.Recently, Kredel[43] has reported
from Riegel's clinic seventeen cases of simple dilatation in which free
hydrochloric acid was only exceptionally and temporarily absent from
the gastric fluids, and nineteen cases of cancerous dilatation in
which, with very rare exceptions, free hydrochloric acid was
continuously absent.Cases, however, have been observed by Ewald,
Seeman, and others in which free hydrochloric acid has been found in
stomachs dilated from gastric cancer.It is to be noted that free
hydrochloric acid is absent from the stomach in other conditions than
in gastrectasia due to cancer; of which conditions the most important
are fever, amyloid degeneration of the stomach (Edinger), and some
cases of gastric catarrh.Free hydrochloric acid is also usually absent
during the first twenty minutes to an hour after a meal.We have not
sufficient information as to the presence or absence of free
hydrochloric acid in cases of gastric cancer without dilatation of the
stomach.To Von der Velden's symptom no pathognomonic value can be
attached, but it may prove, in connection with other symptoms, an aid
in diagnosis.The presumption is against gastric cancer if free
hydrochloric acid be found continuously in a dilated stomach.Less
importance can be attached to the absence of free hydrochloric acid
unless the observations extend over several weeks and fever and amyloid
degeneration are excluded.[Footnote 42: _Deutsches Arch.[Footnote 43: _Zeitschrift f. klin.The tests for free hydrochloric acid are most satisfactorily applied to
the fluids withdrawn by the stomach-pump.After a sufficient quantity
for examination has been withdrawn the syphon process may be {544}
substituted.Tests may also be applied to vomited material, although
here the admixture of secretions from the nose, mouth, and throat may
render the results less conclusive.Edinger's method of swallowing bits
of sponge enclosed in gelatin capsules and attached to a string, by
which they can be withdrawn, may also be employed.The sponge should be
free from sand, deprived of alkaline carbonates by hydrochloric acid,
and rendered perfectly neutral by washing in distilled water.For clinical purposes the most convenient tests are those which depend
upon certain changes in color produced in reagents which enable us to
distinguish inorganic from organic acids.In the gastric juice the only
inorganic acid which comes into consideration is hydrochloric acid, and
the most important organic acid is lactic.Saturated aqueous solutions of tropaeolin, marked in the trade OO
(Von Miller, V. d. Velden).The solution should be perfectly clear and
of a lemon-yellow color.This solution is  red by the addition
of hydrochloric acid even in very dilute solution (0.01 per cent.).A
similar change in color is produced by lactic acid in somewhat less
dilute solution (0.06 per cent.), but the red color produced by lactic
acid disappears upon shaking with ether, while that produced by
hydrochloric acid remains, unless the acid was present in very minute
quantity.Tropaeolin is therefore a very delicate test for free acid in
general, but it does not distinguish so well as some other tests
hydrochloric from lactic acid.Aqueous solution of methyl-violet (an aniline dye) in the strength
of 0.025 per cent.The solution should be of a violet
color, and in a test-tube should allow the light to pass readily
through it.The addition of hydrochloric acid in dilute solution
changes the violet to a blue color, in stronger solution to a greenish
tint.With lactic acid in stronger solution methyl-violet gives a
similar but less distinct reaction.Methyl-violet, while a less
delicate test than tropaeolin, is better adapted for distinguishing
hydrochloric from lactic acid.Ferric chloride and carbolic acid test (Uffelmann).Mix 3 drops of
liquor ferri chloridi (German Pharmacopoeia, specific gravity 1482), 3
drops of very concentrated solution of carbolic acid, and 20 ccm.The addition of even very dilute solutions of lactic
acid (0.05 per cent.)changes the amethyst-blue color of this
test-fluid to a yellow color, with a shade of green.Dilute solutions
of hydrochloric acid produce a steel-gray, and stronger solutions a
complete decolorization of the fluid.When both hydrochloric and lactic
acids are present the effect of the lactic acid predominates unless
only a mere trace of it is present.This is therefore a good test for
lactic acid.It is necessary to prepare the test-fluid fresh each time
before using.It is well to test the digestive power of the filtered fluid from
the stomach by suspending in the fluid a floccule of washed fibrin and
keeping the fluid at a temperature of about 100 degrees F. If free
hydrochloric acid be present in moderate quantity, in a short time the
fibrin will begin to be dissolved, but if the acidity be due to organic
acid the fibrin will be dissolved very slowly or not at all.In applying these various tests the fluids from the stomach should be
filtered and the filtrate used.It is best not to rely upon a single
test, but to employ them in combination.The fluids may be mixed in a
test-tube.The reaction is sometimes most distinct when the fluids are
allowed {545} to mingle upon a white porcelain dish.It is sometimes of
advantage to concentrate the mingled fluids by evaporation.The fluid
obtained by the stomach-pump five or six hours after a meal is the most
suitable for diagnostic tests.The presence of peptones and of
dissolved albumen makes the tests less delicate for the gastric fluids
than for simple aqueous solutions of the acids.[44]

[Footnote 44: For further information on this subject consult Von der
Velden, _loc.cit._; Uffelmann, _Deutsches Arch.431; Edinger, _ibid._, Bd.555; and Kredel, _loc.cit._]

It is important to distinguish between the slight and the copious
hemorrhages of gastric cancer.The admixture of a small quantity of blood with the vomit, giving to
the latter the so-called coffee-grounds appearance, is a very common
occurrence in gastric cancer.Melaenamesis, as the vomiting of brown or
black substance resembling coffee-grounds is called, is estimated to
occur in about one-half of the cases of cancer of the stomach.It is
observed particularly in the cachectic stage, in which it is not rare
for some brown or black sediment to be almost constantly present in the
vomit.The brown or black color is due to the conversion by the acids
of the stomach of the normal blood-coloring matter into dark-brown
haematin.The presence of blood in the vomited matter can generally be recognized
by the naked eye.By the aid of the microscope red blood-corpuscles,
more or less changed, especially decolorized red blood-corpuscles (the
so-called shadows), can usually be detected.Sometimes only amorphous
masses of altered blood-pigment can be seen.The spectroscope may also
be employed, in which alkaline solutions of haematin produce an
absorption-band between C and D, usually reaching or passing D. The
presence of blood-coloring matter can also be readily detected by the
production of haemin crystals.[45] The slight hemorrhages are in most
cases the result of ulceration of the cancer, by which process a little
oozing of blood from the capillaries is produced.[Footnote 45: Haemin crystals may be produced by boiling in a test-tube
a little of the suspected fluid or sediment with an excess of glacial
acetic acid and a few particles of common salt.After cooling, a drop
from the lower layers will show under the microscope the dark-brown
rhombic crystals of haemin in case blood-coloring matter was present in
not too minute quantity.]Copious hemorrhages from the stomach are not common in gastric cancer.They occur probably in not over 12 per cent.According to Lebert, they are more liable to occur in males than in
females.Blood vomited in large quantity is either bright red or more
or less darkened in color according to the length of its sojourn in the
stomach.Following profuse haematemesis, some dark, tarry blood is
usually passed by the stools, constituting the symptom called melaena.Copious hemorrhages from the stomach hasten the fatal termination and
may be its immediate forerunner.Cases of gastric cancer have been
reported in which death has occurred from gastrorrhagia before there
has been time for any blood to be either vomited or voided by stool.As
might naturally be expected, patients with gastric cancer do not
usually rally as readily from the effects of gastric hemorrhage as do
most patients with simple ulcer.Profuse gastric hemorrhage, if it
occur, is most common in the late stage of gastric cancer, but I have
known a {546} case of cancer of the stomach in which copious
haematemesis was the first symptom, with the exception of slight
dyspepsia.[46]

[Footnote 46: In a case of cancer of the lesser curvature observed by
Laborie fatal haematemesis occurred before there had been any distinct
symptoms of gastric cancer (Bouchut, _Nouv.Profuse haematemesis is more common with soft cancers than with other
forms.The source of profuse hemorrhage is in some large vessel eroded
by the ulcerative process.The same vessels may be the source of the
bleeding as have been enumerated in connection with gastric ulcer.Cancers situated near the pylorus or on the lesser curvature are the
most likely to cause severe hemorrhage.While it is true that coffee-grounds vomiting is most common in cancer,
and profuse haematemesis is most common in ulcer of the stomach, it is
important to remember that either disease may be attended by that form
of hemorrhage which is most common in the other.Dysphagia is one of the most important symptoms of cancer of the
cardia.Dysphagia is sometimes one of the first symptoms to attract
attention, but it may not appear until late in the disease.It is
usually accompanied with painful sensations near the xiphoid cartilage
or behind the sternum, or sometimes in the pharynx.The sensation of
stoppage of the food is usually felt lower down than in ordinary cases
of stenosis of the oesophagus.Stenosis of the cardia can be
appreciated by the passage of an oesophageal bougie, but it is
important to bear in mind that dysphagia may exist in cases of cancer
of the cardia in which the oesophageal bougie does not reveal evidence
of stenosis.Dysphagia may be a prominent symptom in cancer occupying
parts of the stomach remote from the cardia.[47] The dysphagia here
considered is not likely to be confounded with the difficulty in
swallowing which is due to weakness or to aphthous inflammation of the
throat and gullet, which often attends the last days of gastric cancer.[Footnote 47: A case in point has been reported by J. B. S. Jackson.The cancer occupied the pyloric region (_American Journ.Sci._,
April, 1852, p.From a diagnostic point of view the presence of a tumor is the most
important symptom of gastric cancer.In the absence of tumor the
diagnosis of gastric cancer can rarely be made with positiveness.A
tumor of the stomach can be felt in about 80 per cent.of the cases of
cancer of the stomach (Brinton, Lebert).With all of its importance, it
is nevertheless possible to exaggerate the diagnostic value of this
symptom.It is by no means always easy to determine whether an existing
tumor belongs to the stomach or not, and even if there is proved to be
a tumor of the stomach, there may be difficulty in deciding whether or
not it is a cancer.Many instances might be cited in which errors in
these respects have been made by experienced diagnosticians.The value
of tumor as a diagnostic symptom is somewhat lessened by the fact that
it often does not appear until comparatively late in the disease, so
that the diagnosis remains in doubt for a long time.It is to be
remembered also that tumor is absent in no less than one-fifth of the
cases of gastric cancer.In order to understand in what situations cancers of the stomach are
likely to produce palpable tumors, it is necessary to have in mind
certain points concerning the situation and the relations of this
organ.The stomach is placed obliquely in the left hypochondrium and the
epigastric regions of the abdomen, approaching the vertical more nearly
{547} than the horizontal position.The mesial plane of the body passes
through the pyloric portion of the stomach, so that, according to
Luschka, five-sixths of the stomach lie to the left of this plane.The
most fixed part of the stomach is the cardiac orifice, which lies
behind the left seventh costal cartilage, near the sternum, and is
overlapped by the left extremity of the liver.The pyloric orifice lies
usually in the sagittal plane passing through the right margin of the
sternum, and on a level with the inner extremity of the right eighth
costal cartilage.The pylorus is less fixed than the cardia.When the
stomach is empty the pylorus is to be found in the median line of the
body; when the stomach is greatly distended the pylorus may be pushed
two and a half to three inches to the right of the median line.The
pylorus is overlapped by a part of the liver, usually the lobus
quadratus or the umbilical fissure.About two-thirds of the stomach lie
in the left hypochondrium covered in by the ribs, and to the left and
posteriorly by the spleen.The highest point of the stomach is the top
of the fundus, which usually reaches to the left fifth rib.The lowest
point of the stomach is in the convexity of the greater curvature to
the left of the median line.The lower border of the stomach varies in
position more than any other part of the organ.In the median line this
border is situated on the average about midway between the base of the
xiphoid cartilage and the umbilicus, but within the limits of health it
may extend nearly to the umbilicus.The lesser curvature in the greater
part of its course extends from the cardia downward to the left of the
vertebral column and nearly parallel with it.The lesser curvature then
crosses to the right side on a level with the inner extremity of the
eighth rib, and in the median line lies about two and a half fingers'
breadth above the lower margin of the stomach.The lesser curvature and
the adjacent part of the anterior surface of the stomach are covered by
the left lobe of the liver.It follows from this description that only the lower part of the
anterior surface of the stomach is in contact with the anterior
abdominal walls.This part in contact with the anterior abdominal walls
corresponds to a part of the body and of the pyloric region of the
stomach, and belongs to the epigastric region.The remainder of the
stomach is covered either by the liver or by the ribs, so that in the
normal condition it cannot be explored by palpation.It is now evident that tumors in certain parts of the stomach can be
readily detected by palpation, whereas tumors in other parts of the
organ can be detected only with difficulty or not at all.Cancer of the
cardia cannot be felt by palpation of the abdomen unless the tumor
extends down upon the body of the stomach.Cancers of the fundus, the
lesser curvature, and the posterior wall of the stomach often escape
detection by palpation, but if they are of large size or if the stomach
becomes displaced by their growth, they may be felt.Cancerous tumors
of the anterior wall or of the greater curvature are rare, but they can
be detected even when of small size, unless there are special obstacles
to the physical examination of the abdomen.Cancerous tumors of the
pylorus can be made out by palpation in the majority of cases
notwithstanding the overlapping of this part by the liver.The pyloric
tumor may be so large as to project from beneath the border of the
liver, or the hand may be pressed beneath this border so that the tumor
can be felt, or, what is most frequently the {548} case, the weight of
the tumor or the distension of the stomach drags the pylorus downward.The pylorus may, however, be so fixed by adhesions underneath the
liver, or the liver may be so enlarged, that tumors of this part cannot
be reached by palpation.The situation in which cancerous tumors of the pylorus can be felt
varies considerably.The usual situation is in the lower part of the
epigastric region, a little to the right of the median line, but it is
almost as common for these tumors to be felt in the umbilical region,
and it is not rare for them to appear to the left of the median
line.[48] Brinton states that the tumor is in the umbilical region more
frequently in the female sex than in the male, in consequence of the
compression exercised by corsets.Occasionally pyloric cancers produce
tumors in the right hypochondrium.Exceptionally, pyloric tumors have
been felt as low as the iliac crest or even in the hypogastric region.[Footnote 48: According to Jackson and Tyson, pyloric cancers are felt
more frequently to the left than to the right of the median line.]Cancers of the stomach do not usually attain a very large size.An important criterion of
cancerous tumors of the stomach is their gradual increase in size by
progressive growth.The consistence of cancerous tumors of the stomach is nearly always
hard, as appreciated by palpation through the abdominal walls.The
surface of the tumor is usually nodulated or irregular, but
exceptionally it is smooth.The tumor may be movable or not, but in the
majority of cases it is rendered immovable by adhesions.Mobility of
the tumor, however, does not exclude the presence of adhesions.The
tumor sometimes follows the respiratory movements of the diaphragm,
especially when it is adherent to this structure or to the liver, but
more frequently the tumor is not affected or but slightly affected by
the movements of the diaphragm.If the tumor is not fixed by adhesions,
it may change its position somewhat according to the varying degrees of
distension of the stomach or in consequence of pressure of intestine
distended with gas or feces.In consequence of these movements or of an
overlying distended colon the tumor may even disappear temporarily.It
is possible that the tumor may lessen or disappear in consequence of
sloughing of the growth.[49] It is not rare for a certain amount of
pulsation to be communicated to the growth by the subjacent aorta.This
pulsation is most common with pyloric tumors.[Footnote 49: Symptoms which have been considered as diagnostic of
sloughing of stenosing cancers of the pylorus are diminution in the
size of the tumor, alleviation of the vomiting, hemorrhage, replacement
of obstinate constipation by diarrhoeal stools which often contain
blood, increased pain after eating, and rapid progress of cachexia.]The percussion note over the tumor is usually tympanitic dulness.Sometimes there is very little alteration over the tumor of the normal
tympanitic note belonging to the stomach; on the other hand,
exceptionally there is absolute flatness over the tumor.It is often of assistance in determining that a tumor belongs to the
pylorus to find dilatation of the stomach.An abnormal fulness of the
epigastric and umbilical regions may then be observed, and through the
abdominal walls, if thin, may be seen the peristaltic movements of the
stomach.Other signs and symptoms aid in the diagnosis of dilatation of
the stomach, and will be described in connection with this disease.{549} It is to be noted that what one takes to be the primary tumor of
the stomach is not so very rarely a secondary cancerous mass in the
stomach or in adjacent lymph-glands or in the peritoneum.Such nodules
may also increase the apparent size of the original tumor.As has been
pointed out by Rosenbach,[50] spasm of the muscular coat near a cancer
or an ulcer of the stomach may produce a false tumor or enlarge a real
tumor.Wochenschr._, 1882, p.The cancer, instead of appearing as a circumscribed tumor, may
infiltrate diffusely the gastric walls, and so escape detection.When
the greater part or the whole of the stomach is the seat of this
diffuse cancerous infiltration, a sense of abnormal resistance may be
appreciated by palpation in the epigastric region.In these cases the
stomach is often much shrunken in size.The outlines of the thickened
organ can sometimes be made out, but the physical signs do not suffice
for the diagnosis of cancer.With cancer of the cardia there is usually more or less atrophy of the
stomach, which is manifested by sinking in of the epigastric region.Sometimes the tumor eludes discovery on account of special obstacles to
the physical examination of the abdomen, such as a thick layer of fat
in the abdominal walls or a large quantity of ascitic fluid.Every aid
in the physical examination of the abdomen should be resorted to.The
patient should be examined while lying on his back with the utmost
possible relaxation of the abdominal walls.If necessary, he should
also be examined while standing or in the knee-elbow position.Sometimes a deep inspiration will force down a previously concealed
tumor.The emptying of a dilated stomach by means of a stomach-tube
will sometimes bring to prominence a gastric tumor.The inflation of the stomach by the development in it of carbonic acid
gas may render valuable assistance in the diagnosis of tumors of this
organ and of surrounding parts.This method has been recommended by W.
Ph.H. Wagner among others, and especially by Rosenbach.[51] From 20 to
30 grains of bicarbonate of soda and from 15 to 20 grains of tartaric
acid may be introduced into the stomach.The soda, dissolved in
lukewarm water, may be given first and followed by the acid in
solution, or, better, the mixed powders may be swallowed in the dry
state and followed by a tumblerful of water.Some persons require a
larger quantity of the powder in order to inflate the stomach.Occasionally the introduction of the effervescing powder fails to
produce any appreciable distension of the stomach.This negative result
may be due to the escape of the gas into the intestine in consequence
of incontinence of the pylorus--a condition which Ebstein[52] has
observed and described especially in connection with pyloric cancer.When this pyloric insufficiency exists the resulting tympanitic
distension of the intestine is a hindrance to palpation of tumors of
the stomach.Failure to secure distension of the stomach is not always
due to this cause.It may be necessary to make repeated trials of the
effervescing mixture.It is well to have a stomach-tube at hand to
evacuate the gas if this should cause much distress.H. Wagner, _Ueber die Percussion des Magens nach
Auftreibung mit Kohlensaure_, Marburg, 1869; O. Rosenbach, _Deutsche
med.Wochenschr._, 1882, p.[Footnote 52: W. Ebstein, _Volkmann's Samml.In some respects simpler and more easily controlled is the method of
{550} distending the stomach by injecting air into it through a
stomach-tube, as recommended by Runeberg.[53] For this purpose the
balloon of a Richardson's spray apparatus may be attached to a
soft-rubber stomach-tube.In this way the desired quantity of air can
be introduced and at any time allowed to escape through the tube.[Footnote 53: J. W. Runeberg, _Deutsches Arch.When the stomach has been inflated the contours of tumors of the
pylorus often become surprisingly distinct in consequence of the
changes in the position and the shape of the stomach.When the tumor is
fixed by adhesions, it may be possible to follow the contours of the
stomach into those of the tumor.False tumors produced by spasm of the
muscular walls of the stomach may be made to disappear by this
distension of the organ.This procedure enables one to distinguish
between tumors behind and those in front of the stomach, as the former
become indistinct or disappear when the stomach is inflated.By
bringing out the contours of the stomach the relations of the tumor to
surrounding organs may be rendered for the first time clear.Assistance
in diagnosis may also be afforded by distension of the colon with water
or with gas or with air, per rectum, in order to determine the course
of the colon and its relations to abdominal tumors (Mader, Ziemssen,
Runeberg).A manifest contraindication to distension of the stomach or
of the colon with gas exists if there is a suspicion that the coats of
these parts are so thinned by ulceration that they might rupture from
the distending force of the gas.There have been no cases recorded
where such an accident has happened.Only in exceptional cases are the bowels regular throughout the course
of gastric cancer.Constipation is the rule, and not infrequently there
is obstinate constipation.This is to be expected when the patient eats
little and vomits a great deal, or when there is stenosis of the
pylorus.In cancer, as in many other diseases of the stomach, the
peristaltic movements of the intestine are inclined to be sluggish.Occasional diarrhoea is also common in gastric cancer, being present,
according to Tripier,[54] at some period or other in over one-half the
cases.Constipation often gives place to diarrhoea during the last
months or during the last days of life.In other periods of the disease
diarrhoea not infrequently alternates with constipation.In rare cases
diarrhoea is an early symptom, and it may be present exceptionally
throughout the greater part of the disease.The irritation of
undigested food sometimes explains the diarrhoea.When diarrhoea is
persistent there probably exists catarrhal inflammation of the large
intestine, or in some instances there may be diphtheritic and
ulcerative inflammation of the colon, causing dysenteric symptoms
during the last stages of cancer of the stomach.[Footnote 54: "Etude clinique sur la Diarrhee dans le Cancer de
l'Estomac," _Lyon Med._, 1881, Nos.Black stools containing altered blood occur for some days after profuse
gastric hemorrhage.It is important to examine the stools for blood, as
bleeding may occur from cancer of the stomach without any vomiting of
blood.There is no change in the urine characteristic of gastric cancer.Deposits of urates are not uncommon.If there be profuse vomiting or
frequent washing out of the stomach, the urine often becomes alkaline
from fixed {551} alkali.[55] The amount of urea is diminished in
consequence of the slight activity of the nutritive processes of the
body.Rommelaere attaches unmerited diagnostic importance to this
diminution of urea.A similar diminution of urea occurs in other like
states of depressed nutrition.[Footnote 55: According to Quincke, when the acid in the stomach is not
hydrochloric acid, but organic acid resulting from fermentation, then
vomiting and washing out the stomach do not reduce the acidity of the
urine (_Zeitschrift f. klin.Albuminuria does not belong to the history of gastric cancer, although
a small quantity of albumen may be present in the urine as in other
anaemic and cachectic conditions.A larger quantity of albumen may be
due to parenchymatous and fatty degeneration of the kidney or to
chronic diffuse nephritis, which are infrequent but recognized
complications of gastric cancer.There is often an excess of indican in
the urine, to which, however, no diagnostic significance can be
attached.The urine in gastric cancer sometimes contains an excess of aceton, or
at least of some substance which yields aceton upon the application of
various tests.This so-called acetonuria is present without any
symptoms referable to it, so far as we know.Allied to this so-called
acetonuria is that condition of the urine in which it is 
burgundy-red upon the addition of ferric chloride in solution
(Gerhardt's reaction).It is not positively known what substance
imparts this last reaction to the urine.V. Jaksch, who has studied the
subject industriously, believes that the red coloring substance is
diacetic acid, and he proposes to call the condition diaceturia.Fresh
urine, which shows in a marked degree Gerhardt's reaction, often has a
peculiar aromatic, fruity odor, as has also the expired air.Gerhardt's
reaction has been studied mostly in diabetic urine, but it occurs
sometimes in cases of gastric cancer and in a variety of diseases.This
so-called diaceturia may be associated with a peculiar form of coma,
but it is oftener observed without any symptoms referable to it[56]
(see page 555).[Footnote 56: The various tests for aceton in the urine are not
altogether satisfactory.They are to be found in an article by Von
Jaksch in the _Zeitschrift f. klin.For
English readers a good abstract of an article by Penzoldt on these
tests and on acetonaemia in general is to be found in _The Medical
News_ of Philadelphia, Aug.162, but this does not consider
the corrections and additions to be found in V. Jaksch's article cited
above.Acetonuria has been observed especially in diabetes mellitus,
fevers, carcinoma, and dyspepsia.The substance which produces Gerhardt's reaction is to be distinguished
from other substances which may be present in the urine and give a red
color with ferric chloride--first, by the fact that boiling the urine
in a test-tube for five or six minutes destroys the first-named
substance, or causes the red color to disappear in case this has been
produced by ferric chloride; and, secondly, by the fact that ether
extracts the substance from acidified urine, and that the red color
produced in the ether extract by ferric chloride (it may be necessary
to first neutralize the acid) fades away in the course of a few days
(V. Jaksch, _Zeitschrift f. Heilkunde_, Bd.Urines which
respond to Gerhardt's reaction in a marked degree yield aceton on
distillation, but aceton or an aceton-yielding substance may be present
in considerable quantity without response of the urine to Gerhardt's
test.]Disorders of nutrition embrace an important group of symptoms, such as
loss of flesh and strength, impoverished blood, and cachectic color of
the skin.Emaciation and debility are sometimes the first symptoms of
gastric cancer to attract attention, and often the first symptoms to
arouse anxiety.More frequently these symptoms of disordered nutrition
first appear after dyspeptic ailments or pain have existed for several
weeks or months.It may aid in the diagnosis of gastric cancer to weigh
the patient {552} from time to time, as carcinoma is generally attended
by progressive loss of weight.The patient frequently becomes morose and depressed in spirits.His
strength fails, sometimes disproportionately to the loss of flesh.There is no disease in which emaciation becomes more extreme than in
cases of gastric cancer.In many cases profound anaemia develops, and sometimes in such a degree
that this symptom cannot be regarded always as simply co-ordinate with
the other disorders of nutrition, but is to be regarded rather as an
evidence of some special disturbance of the blood-forming organs.The
blood may present the same changes as are observed in pernicious
anaemia, such as extreme reduction in the number of red
blood-corpuscles (to one million or even half that number in a cubic
millimeter) and manifold deformed shapes of the corpuscles
(poikilocytosis).In extreme cases the proportion of haemoglobin in the
blood may be reduced to 50 or 60 per cent.[57]
There is occasionally a moderate increase in the number of white
blood-corpuscles.In one case of gastric cancer I observed a
leucocytosis in which there was one white to twenty red
blood-corpuscles without enlargement of the spleen.[58]

[Footnote 57: The granular disintegrating corpuscles
(Zerfallskorperchen of Riess) may also be found in the blood in
considerable number.Leichtenstern has observed that toward the end of
life the relative proportion of haemoglobin in the blood may be
increased, sometimes rapidly, and may even exceed the normal limit.This is due to concentration of the blood in consequence of the loss of
water.In such cases the tissues appear abnormally dry and the blood
thick and tarry at the autopsy (_Ziemssen's Handb.u.
Therap._, Bd.It seems to me proper to distinguish two kinds of anaemia in gastric
cancer--a simple anaemia, which is present in the majority of cases,
and can be explained by the development of the cancer and the
disturbance of the gastric functions; and a pernicious anaemia, which
is present only in exceptional cases, and has the typical symptoms of
progressive pernicious anaemia.][Footnote 58: In a case of large medullary cancer of the stomach
reported by H. Mayer there was one white to fifty red blood-corpuscles.The spleen was not enlarged (Bayer, _Aerztl.Intelligenzblatt_, 1870,
No.A similar case is related by Lebert, in which, however, the
spleen was enlarged (_op.To the pallor of anaemia is added often a faded yellowish tint of the
skin which is considered characteristic of the cancerous cachexia.At
the same time, the skin is frequently dry and harsh, and may present
brownish spots (chloasma cachecticorum).The pallid lips, the pale
greenish-yellow color of the face, the furrowed lines, and the pinched
and despondent expression make up a characteristic physiognomy, which,
however, is neither peculiar to gastric cancer nor present in all cases
of the disease.There is no cachectic appearance which is pathognomonic
of cancer; and in this connection it is well to note that there are
cases of gastric ulcer, and particularly of non-cancerous stenosis of
the pylorus, in which all of the symptoms described as peculiar to the
cancerous cachexia are met with.Nevertheless, the weight of these
symptoms in the diagnosis of gastric cancer should not be
underestimated.There is no disease in which profound cachectic
symptoms so frequently and so rapidly develop as in gastric cancer.The profound nutritive disturbances of gastric cancer are referable
partly to the cancer as such, and partly to the impairment of the
functions of the stomach.It is impossible to separate the effects of
these two sets of causes, and distinguish, as some have done, a
cachexia of cancer {553} and a cachexia of inanition.It is the
combination of these causes which renders the cachexia of cancer of the
stomach so common, so rapid in its development, and so profound as
compared with that of cancer in other situations.The relation of
cancer in general to cachexia need not here be discussed, save to say
that there is the best ground for believing that the cachexia is
directly dependent upon the growth and metamorphoses of the primary
cancer and its metastases, and that there is not reason to assume any
dyscrasia antedating the cancerous formation.While the failure of the general health and the gastric symptoms in
general develop side by side, it is especially significant of gastric
cancer when the symptoms of impaired nutrition are more pronounced than
can be explained by the local gastric disturbance.When, however, as
sometimes happens, gastric symptoms are absent or no more than can be
explained by anaemia and marasmus, then in the absence of tumor a
positive diagnosis is impossible.Such cases of gastric cancer during
life often pass for essential or pernicious anaemia.Otherwise,
unexplained symptoms of anaemia with emaciation and debility,
particularly in elderly people, should lead to a careful search for
gastric cancer.Finally, it is necessary to add that there are exceptional cases of
gastric cancer in which there is no emaciation, and in which the
general health appears to be astonishingly well preserved.In most of
these cases death occurs either from some accident of the disease or
from some complication.Slight or moderate oedema about the ankles is a common symptom during
the cachectic stage of gastric cancer.This oedema is due to hydraemia.This cachectic dropsy in rare cases becomes excessive and leads to
anasarca, with serous effusion in the peritoneal, pleural, and
pericardial sacs.Such cases are liable to be mistaken for heart
disease, particularly as a haemic murmur often coexists, or for
Bright's disease.Ascites may be the result not only of hydraemia, but
also of cancerous peritonitis or of pressure on the portal vein by
cancer.Many cases of gastric cancer associated with ascites have been
falsely diagnosed as cirrhosis of the liver, and sometimes the
distinction is extremely difficult or impossible.During the greater part of the disease the pulse is usually normal;
toward the end it is not infrequently rapid, small, and compressible.In consequence of weakness and anaemia any exertion may suffice to
increase the frequency of the pulse, and may induce palpitation of the
heart and syncope.As might be expected as the result of anaemia, haemic murmurs in the
heart and blood-vessels are not rare in gastric cancer.Epigastric pulsation is often very prominent in cases of gastric
cancer, as it may be in various other conditions.This pulsation is
sometimes of a paroxysmal nature.Venous thrombosis is not a rare complication in the last stages of
gastric cancer.It is most common in the femoral and saphenous veins,
and is rapidly followed by painful oedematous swelling of the affected
extremity.Thrombosis of the subclavian and axillary veins is much less
frequent.When it occurs there are the same symptoms of phlegmasia alba
dolens in the upper extremity as have been mentioned for the lower.Lebert has recorded a case of thrombosis of the right external jugular
{554} vein.[59] The thrombosis is the result of marasmus, and therefore
may occur in other gastric diseases besides gastric cancer, so that
this symptom has not all the diagnostic importance for gastric cancer
claimed by Trousseau.Being an evidence of great weakness of the
circulation, marantic thrombosis in cancer of the stomach is of grave
prognostic import.The temperature is often normal throughout the course of gastric
cancer.Febrile attacks, however, are not uncommon in this disease.Elevation of temperature may occur without any complication to explain
it.During the second half of the disease there may be either irregular
febrile attacks or a more continuous fever, which is, however, usually
of a light grade, the temperature not generally exceeding 102 degrees.Lebert describes a light and a hectic
carcinomatous fever.There may be subnormal temperature with collapse during the last days
of life, and in general anaemia and inactivity of nutritive processes
tend to produce a low temperature.Dyspnoea on slight exertion may be present in gastric cancer as a
result of anaemia or of fatty heart.In a few cases of gastric cancer
have been observed symptoms pointing to a reflex vagus neurosis, such
as paroxysms of dyspnoea, oppression in the chest, and palpitation of
the heart, but these symptoms are less common in gastric cancer than in
some other diseases of the stomach.Watson[60] relates a case of
gastric cancer in which increasing dyspnoea and palpitation were such
prominent symptoms that he was led to diagnose fatty heart with portal
congestion as the sole trouble.At the autopsy the heart and lungs were
found healthy, but there was extensive cancer of the greater curvature
of the stomach.He subsequently ascertained that there had been
symptoms pointing to gastric disease.[Footnote 60: Sir T. Watson, _Lectures on the Principles and Practice
of Physic_, vol.The various complications of gastric cancer which affect the
respiratory organs will be considered later.Depression of spirits, lack of energy, headache, neuralgia,
sleeplessness, and vertigo are functional nervous disturbances which
are often the result of disordered digestion from whatever cause, and
are therefore not uncommon in gastric cancer.The theory that these
symptoms are due to the absorption of noxious substances produced in
the stomach and intestine by abnormal digestive processes is
plausible,[61] and more intelligible than reference to some undefined
sympathy between the digestive organs and the nervous system.[Footnote 61: This theory is elaborated by Senator ("Ueber
Selbstinfection durch abnorme Zersetzungsvorgange, etc.," _Zeitschrift
f. klin.The intelligence is generally not impaired in the course of gastric
cancer.Considerable interest belongs to coma as a symptom of cancer of the
stomach, and more particularly to the occurrence of coma with the
peculiar characters which have been described by Kussmaul as
distinguishing diabetic coma.[62] The most distinctive feature in
Kussmaul's group of symptoms is the accompaniment of the coma by a
peculiar {555} dyspnoea in which, without evidence of disease of the
lungs or air-passages, the respirations are strong and deep and often
attended with a groaning sound in expiration.The breathing is either
normal in frequency or oftener moderately increased.The temperature is not much elevated, and
sometimes is much below the normal.Sometimes the coma is preceded by a
period of excitement, with restlessness, and perhaps with screaming.Gerhardt's reaction in the urine may or may not be present.When it is
present in a marked degree there is often an aromatic, chloroform-like
odor to the breath and to the fresh urine.The patient may come out of
the coma, but in the vast majority of cases the coma terminates
fatally.[Footnote 62: _Deutsches Arch.It is now known that this dyspnoeic coma is not confined to diabetes
mellitus, but that it occurs also in gastric cancer and in various
other diseases.[63] Its occurrence in gastric cancer is rare.In this
disease it does not usually appear until anaemia is far advanced, but
it may occur in cases of cancer in which the patient's general health
and nutrition are still fairly good.I recently made the post-mortem
examination of an elderly man, fairly well nourished, who was found in
the streets comatose and brought in this condition to Bellevue
Hospital, where he died in about twelve hours.While in the hospital
his breathing was increased in frequency, forcible, and deep.The urine contained a small quantity of
albumen, but no sugar.At the autopsy was found a large, soft, ulcerated
cancer of the lesser curvature and posterior wall of the stomach near
the pylorus.The kidneys, brain, heart, and other organs were
essentially healthy.[Footnote 63: Von Jaksch was the first to describe this form of coma in
cancer of the stomach (_Wien.Wochenschr._, 1883, pp.He adopted the term coma carcinomatosum, and more recently coma
diaceticum.L. Riess has reported seventeen cases of this coma
occurring in a variety of diseases, such as pernicious anaemia, gastric
cancer, gastric ulcer, tuberculosis, which all had in common profound
anaemia.He proposes the term dyspnoeic coma (_Zeitschrift f. klin.Senator has described two
cases of gastric cancer with this coma.He uses the terms dyscrasic
coma and Kussmaul's group of symptoms (_ibid._, Bd.In the
cases described by Litten under the name coma dyspepticum, dyspnoea was
absent, but Gerhardt's reaction in the urine was present.In Litten's
cases structural disease of the stomach was not supposed to be present.The patients recovered from the coma (_ibid._, Suppl.We possess no satisfactory explanation of this form of coma.In
diabetes it is considered to be due to the presence in the blood of
some intoxicating agent.For a time this agent was thought to be
aceton; it is now believed by Von Jaksch to be diacetic acid.Much
stress has been laid upon the aromatic, fruity odor of the breath and
of the fresh urine, and upon the presence of some substance in the
urine which imparts to it a burgundy-red color upon the addition of
liquor ferri chloridi (Gerhardt's reaction.See changes in the urine,
page 551).Although the whole aceton question is at present in a very
confused state, there is no proof that aceton or its allies possesses
the toxic properties assumed by this theory;[64] and it is certain that
dyspnoeic coma may occur in diabetes and in other diseases without the
presence of Gerhardt's reaction in the urine.It is also true that this
reaction often occurs without any clinical symptoms referable to it.Riess and Senator believe that in non-diabetic {556} cases anaemia is
the most important factor in the production of this coma.[65]

[Footnote 64: Frerichs, _Zeitschrift f. klin.[Footnote 65: Riess refers the coma to the anaemia as such, whereas
Senator thinks that, in consequence of the depraved nutrition of the
body resulting from the anaemia, some toxic substance is developed
which enters the circulation.]Coma, probably belonging to this same variety, may occur in gastric
cancer without the peculiar dyspnoea which has been described.There is
reason to believe that this dyspnoea is not a necessary symptom of the
so-called diabetic coma.Chronic Bright's disease terminating with uraemic coma is an occasional
but not frequent complication of gastric cancer.Coma and other cerebral symptoms may be produced by secondary cancerous
tumors in the brain.Stupor deepening into coma may develop during the often-prolonged
death-agony of gastric cancer.The distribution, origin, and frequency of cancerous growths secondary
to gastric cancer are most conveniently considered under Pathological
Anatomy.Symptoms referable to certain localizations of these secondary
cancerous deposits, however, are so common, and so interwoven with the
clinical history of cancer of the stomach, that it is desirable to
consider some of these symptoms in the present connection.Cancer of the liver is the most important of these secondary cancerous
growths.It is estimated to be present in nearly one-third of the cases
of gastric cancer, but by no means in all these cases does it produce
symptoms.As a rule, the earlier hepatic cancer forms in the course of
gastric cancer the more likely is it to be attended by symptoms.The
most important symptoms of secondary cancer of the liver are
enlargement of the liver, peritoneal exudation, and persistent icterus.When nodular growths can be felt in the free border or surface of the
liver, the diagnosis is generally easily established.Sometimes the
liver remains of normal size or is even contracted, and then the
diagnosis is difficult or impossible.Ascites or exudative peritonitis
is present in about one-half of the cases of cancer of the liver.It is only persistent jaundice
which aids in the diagnosis of hepatic cancer.The various combinations of gastric cancer with secondary hepatic
cancer may be clinically grouped as follows:

1.Symptoms of gastric cancer with latent hepatic cancer.Symptoms of gastric cancer followed by symptoms of hepatic cancer.Symptoms both of gastric cancer and of hepatic cancer present when
the case comes under observation.Symptoms of hepatic cancer with latent gastric cancer.Symptoms of hepatic cancer followed by symptoms of gastric cancer.Symptoms of anaemia and
marasmus, or of chronic exudative peritonitis, or of chronic pleurisy.From this grouping it is evident that the existence of secondary
hepatic cancer may aid in the diagnosis of cancer of the stomach, or
may mislead, or may be without influence.The greatest assistance in
diagnosis is rendered when the physical signs and the symptoms of
hepatic {557} cancer develop some time after the appearance of gastric
symptoms which may previously have been equivocal.Much more difficult
to diagnosticate are the cases of hepatic cancer accompanied or
followed by gastric symptoms, inasmuch as cancer of the liver, whether
primary or secondary, may be attended with marked disturbance of the
gastric functions, including haematemesis.In these cases, unless a
tumor of the stomach can be discovered, a positive diagnosis of gastric
cancer is impossible.In view of the infrequency of primary cancer of
the liver, however, there will be in many of these cases a strong
probability in favor of primary cancer of the stomach.When it is
remembered that over one-third of the cancers of the liver are
secondary to cancer of the stomach, it is evident that in cases which
appear to be primary hepatic cancer very careful attention should be
given to the exploration of the stomach.But even then diagnostic
errors will often be unavoidable.Cancer of the peritoneum secondary to cancer of the stomach may produce
no symptoms, and so pass unrecognized.The diagnosis of peritoneal
cancer is readily made when, after the recognition of gastric cancer,
secondary cancerous nodules in the peritoneum can be felt through the
abdominal walls or through the vagina.There are cases of gastric
cancer in which the symptoms are all referable to secondary cancer of
the peritoneum.Cancer of the peritoneum is usually attended with fluid
exudation in the peritoneal cavity.The chemical and the microscopical
examination of this fluid withdrawn by paracentesis may aid in the
diagnosis of cancerous peritonitis.Whereas in dropsical accumulations
in the peritoneal cavity the quantity of albumen in the fluid is
usually less than 2-1/2 per cent., in cancerous peritonitis there is
usually from 3 to 4 per cent.of albumen, the percentage rarely falling
as low as 2-1/2 per cent., but sometimes being as high as from 5 to 6
per cent.The percentage of albumen in ordinary peritonitis is usually
over 4.[66] Clumps of cancer-cells are sometimes to be found by
microscopical examination of the fluid.These cells are large,
epithelioid in shape, and often contain vacuoles and fatty granules.It
is only when these cells are arranged in clumps or as so-called budding
cells, and when they are present in abundance, that they are
diagnostic.They are to be sought especially in fibrinous coagula.They
are present only when the cancerous alveoli actually communicate with
the peritoneal cavity.[67] The development of cancerous nodules in the
margins of an opening made in the abdominal walls by a trocar is also
evidence of cancerous disease of the peritoneum.The same thickening
and retraction of the mesentery and omentum may occur in cancerous as
in tuberculous peritonitis.In both the exudation is often hemorrhagic.[Footnote 66: The conditions under which the estimation of the quantity
of albumen in the peritoneal exudation may prove of diagnostic aid are
fully considered by Runeberg (_Deutsches Arch.Here also are given methods for making this analysis for
clinical purposes.][Footnote 67: The literature on this subject is as follows: Foulis,
_Brit.2, 1878; Thornton, _ibid._, Sept.7,
1878; Quincke, _Deutsches Arch.580;
Ehrlich, _Charite Annalen_, vii.226; Brieger, _ibid._, viii.]Importance has been attached to enlargement of the supraclavicular
lymphatic glands in the diagnosis of cancer of the stomach, but there
are so many causes of enlargement of these glands that not much
significance can be attached to this symptom, which, moreover, is
absent in most {558} cases.Still, under certain circumstances this
glandular enlargement may aid in the diagnosis.The same remarks apply
to enlargement of the inguinal glands, which is a common occurrence in
case cancer involves the peritoneum.One must not mistake abnormal
prominence of the lymphatic glands in consequence of emaciation for
actual enlargement.Gastric cancer much less frequently than gastric ulcer causes
perforation of the stomach.Of 507 cases of gastric cancer collected by
Brinton, perforation into the general peritoneal cavity occurred in 17
(3-1/3 per cent.).[68] In two cases of gastric cancer reported by Ellis
perforative peritonitis was preceded by symptoms supposed to be only
those of ordinary dyspepsia, hemorrhage and vomiting being absent.[69]
Various fistulous communications like those described under gastric
ulcer may be the result of perforation of gastric cancer, but with the
exception of gastro-colic fistula they are much more frequently
produced by ulcer than by cancer.In 160 cases of gastric cancer
collected by Dittrich, gastro-colic fistula existed in 6 (3-3/4 per
cent.).[70] In 507 cases collected by Brinton this fistula existed in
11 (2.17 per cent.).In Lange's 210 cases gastro-colic fistula existed
in 8 (3.8 per cent.).Of 33 cases of gastro-colic fistula collected by
Murchison, 21 were caused by cancerous ulceration.[71] The symptoms
characteristic of fistulous communication between the stomach and the
colon are the vomiting of fecal matter and the passage of undigested
food by the stools.These symptoms are not present in all cases, so
that a diagnosis is not always possible.Fecal vomiting is influenced
by the size of the opening between the stomach and the colon.With
great obstruction at the pylorus, fecal vomiting, as might be expected,
is absent or infrequent, while the passage of undigested food by the
bowels is common.Under these circumstances vomiting is sometimes
relieved after the establishment of the fistula.Aid may be afforded in
the diagnosis of gastro-colic fistula by the introduction into the
rectum or into the stomach of  or other easily recognizable
substances, and determining their presence in the vomit or in the
stools in consequence of their escape by the unnatural outlet.V.
Ziemssen has determined in a case of gastro-colic fistula due to cancer
the escape into the stomach of carbonic acid gas artificially generated
in the rectum, with failure to obtain distension of the colon.[72] A
number of instances of gastro-cutaneous fistula due to gastric cancer
have been recorded, but this form of fistula is much less common than
gastro-colic fistula, and much less frequently the result of cancer
than of ulcer of the stomach.Subcutaneous emphysema may precede the
formation of the fistula.Other gastric fistulous communications
resulting from cancer, such as with the pleura, the lungs, the small
intestine, are too infrequent to merit consideration under the
symptomatology of the disease.cit._) records in 210 cases of
gastric cancer 12 perforations into the peritoneal cavity (5.7 per
cent.).][Footnote 70: _Prager Vierteljahrsch._, vol.[Footnote 72: _Deutsches Arch.He
recommends for extreme distension of the colon in an adult the
introduction, by means of a tube passed up the rectum, of a solution of
about 5 drachms of sodii bicarb.and 4-1/2 drachms of tartaric
acid--injected not all at once, but in three or four doses at intervals
of a few minutes, the tube being cleaned in the intervals by the
injection of three ounces of water, so as to avoid generation of gas in
the tube.The generation of a smaller quantity of gas would suffice for
the purpose here in view.]{559} As a rule, patients with gastric cancer die from gradual
exhaustion.In a condition of extreme emaciation and feebleness the
patient sinks into a state of collapse, accompanied often with stupor,
sometimes with mild delirium.The death-agony is prolonged frequently
from twelve to twenty-four hours, and sometimes even longer.On the
other hand, death may occur somewhat suddenly in the last stages of
gastric cancer, and without satisfactory explanation.Death from copious gastric hemorrhage does not occur probably in more
than 1 per cent.In the rare cases of death from perforation of the stomach the patient
is sometimes so exhausted at the time of perforation that the
occurrence of this accident remains unrecognized in the absence of any
complaint of characteristic symptoms.The coma which sometimes leads to the fatal termination of gastric
cancer has already been sufficiently considered.Finally, death may be the result of certain complications more or less
dependent upon the cancer.Of these the most important are suppurative
peritonitis and pulmonary complications, particularly oedema, terminal
pneumonia, and embolism of the pulmonary artery.DURATION.--It is evidently impossible to determine the exact duration
of a cancer of the stomach.Doubtless in all cases there is a period of
growth of the tumor before it produces symptoms, and the duration of
this latent period can never be determined.When symptoms appear they
are often at first so mild as to be readily overlooked, and so
ambiguous that even if recognized they are not clearly referable to the
cancer.Gastric symptoms may have preceded, perhaps for years, the
development of the cancer, so as to lead to the assumption of a longer
duration of the cancer than is really the case.Estimates, therefore,
of the duration of gastric cancer can be only of limited value.From 198 cases Brinton[73] estimates the average duration of gastric
cancer as about twelve and a half months, the maximum duration as about
thirty-six months, and the minimum as one month.From 36 cases
Katzenellenbogen[74] estimates the average duration as eighteen months,
the maximum as five years and five months, the minimum as one month.From 112 cases Lebert[75] makes the average duration fifteen months and
the maximum four years.of the cases Lebert found the
duration less than three months, in 62 per cent.between six and
eighteen months, in 42 per cent.between six and twelve months, in 17
per cent.between three and six months, and in the same number of cases
between eighteen months and four years.cit._]

[Footnote 74: _Op.cit._]

[Footnote 75: _Op.cit._]

Estimates of several years' duration (such as nine years in the case of
Napoleon) are to be received with scepticism.In these cases symptoms
of gastralgia or of dyspepsia or of gastric ulcer have preceded the
development of the cancer.It has already been mentioned that cancer
may develop in a simple ulcer of the stomach.Mathieu,[76] from an analysis of 27 cases of gastric cancer occurring
under thirty-four years, found the average duration in early life to be
only three months.In only 2 out of 19 cases did the duration exceed
one year.Although this analysis is based upon too small a number of
cases, there {560} seems to be no doubt that gastric cancer pursues a
more rapid course in early life than it does in old people.[Footnote 76: _Du Cancer precoce de l'Estomac_, Paris, 1884, p.COMPLICATIONS.--Some of the complications of gastric cancer have been
mentioned under Symptomatology.Jaundice may appear in the course of
gastric cancer from a variety of causes, such as catarrhal
gastro-duodenitis, impaction of gall-stones in the common bile-duct,
and pressure on the bile-duct by cancerous growths in the pancreas, in
the portal lymphatic glands, or in the liver itself.Pylethrombosis,
which is likely to be suppurative, is a rare complication.In a case of
cancer of the anterior wall and greater curvature of the stomach
reported by Wickham Legg[77] the symptoms seem to have been mostly
referable to a complicating suppurative pylethrombosis.Simple and
cancerous pylethromboses also occur.Other forms of peritonitis than
the cancerous may complicate gastric cancer, such as suppurative,
sero-fibrinous, and chronic proliferative peritonitis.Catarrhal
enteritis, and particularly diphtheritic colitis, are not infrequent
complications, especially in the later stages of the disease.Chronic
diffuse nephritis, both in the form of the large and of the small
kidney, is a rare complication of cancer of the stomach.Hydrothorax,
sero-fibrinous pleurisy, and emphysema may develop either with or
without cancerous invasion of the pleura.Pericarditis is much less
common; it is most likely to occur with cancer of the cardia.Pyo-pneumothorax, abscess, and gangrene of the lung may result from
perforation of the pleura or of the lung by gastric cancer.Oedema of
the lungs, splenization, and pneumonia, involving usually the lower
lobes, are common in the last days of gastric cancer.Emboli derived
from venous thrombi are sometimes carried into the pulmonary artery or
its branches.Although much has been written as to the exclusion of
tuberculosis by cancer, no such law exists.Both old and fresh
tubercles have been repeatedly observed in cases of gastric cancer.Reference has already been made to the frequent development of aphthae
in the mouth, pharynx, and oesophagus in the final stage of gastric
cancer.Fatty degeneration of the heart may develop in gastric cancer
as in other anaemic states.Phlegmasia alba dolens has already been
mentioned.It is not probable that insanity is to be regarded as more
than an accidental complication of gastric cancer; still, it has been
noticed in several cases--for instance, of Dittrich's 160 cases, 5
patients were insane, 2 with violent mania.Amyloid degeneration has
been present in some cases.Purpura haemorrhagica has been present in a
few instances in the later stages (cachectic purpura).Chronic
catarrhal gastritis and dilatation of the stomach are less
complications than a part of the disease.The relation of cancer to
simple ulcer of the stomach has already been considered.The various
secondary cancerous deposits are most conveniently considered under the
Morbid Anatomy.It is to be remarked that many of the complications of
gastric cancer--as, for instance, pneumonia and peritonitis--may have a
very obscure clinical history, as they often occur when the patient is
greatly prostrated.MORBID ANATOMY.--The following table gives the situation of the tumor
in 1300 cases of cancer of the stomach:[78] {561}

  Pyloric region.791  60.8%
  Lesser curvature.148  11.4%
  Cardia.104   8.0%
  Posterior wall.68   5.2%
  The whole or the greater
    part of the stomach.61   4.7%
  Multiple tumors.45   3.5%
  Greater curvature.34   2.6%
  Anterior wall.30   2.3%
  Fundus.19   1.5%

From this table it appears that three-fifths of all gastric cancers
occupy the pyloric region, but it is not to be understood that in all
of these cases the pylorus itself is involved.In four-fifths of the
cases the comparatively small segment of the stomach represented by the
cardia, the lesser curvature, and the pyloric region is the part
affected by gastric cancer.The lesser curvature and the anterior and
the posterior walls are involved more frequently than appears from the
table, inasmuch as many cancers assigned to the pyloric region extend
to these parts.The fundus is the least frequent seat of cancer.In the
cases classified as involving the greater part of the stomach the
fundus often escapes.[Footnote 78: These cases are collected from the following sources:
Lebert, _op.cit._; Prague statistics of Dittrich, Engel, Wrany, and
Eppinger, _loc.cit._; Habershon, _op.cit._; Katzenellenbogen, _op.cit._; and Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter, _loc.cit._ Gussenbauer and
V. Winiwarter assign to the class of cancers involving the whole
stomach all cases which they found designated simply as carcinoma
ventriculi without further description.This produces in their
statistics an excessive number of cancers under this class.I have
preferred, therefore, to estimate in their collection of cases the
number of cancers involving the whole stomach, according to the
percentage for this class obtained from the other authors above cited.]As was shown by Rokitansky, it is the exception for cancer of the
pylorus to extend into the duodenum, whereas cancer of the cardia
usually invades for a certain distance the oesophagus.The varieties of carcinoma which develop primarily in the stomach are
scirrhous, medullary, colloid, and cylindrical epithelial
carcinoma.[79] The distinction between scirrhous and medullary cancer
is based upon the difference in consistence, the former being hard and
the latter soft.Cylindrical-celled epithelioma cannot be recognized as
such by the naked eye.It presents usually the gross appearances of
medullary cancer.Soft cancer (including both cylindrical-celled
epithelioma and medullary carcinoma) is the most frequent form of
gastric cancer.Next in frequency is scirrhous cancer, and then comes
colloid cancer, which, although not rare, is much less frequent than
the other varieties.[Footnote 79: I have not been able to find an authentic instance of
primary melanotic cancer of the stomach, although this form is included
by most authors in the list of primary gastric cancers.It is known
that most cases formerly described as melanotic cancers are melanotic
sarcomata, which originate usually in the skin or the eye and are
accompanied frequently with abundant metastases.Secondary melanotic
tumors have been several times found in the stomach.They were present
in 7 out of 50 cases of melanotic cancer (or sarcoma) analyzed by
Eiselt, although out of 104 cases not a single primary melanotic cancer
occurred in the stomach (_Prager Viertaljahrschr._, vol.The list of secondary melanotic sarcomata of the stomach might be still
further increased.Of course gastric cancers  by pigment from
old blood-extravasations should not be confounded with melanotic
tumors.]As all degrees of combination and of transition exist between the
different forms of cancer, and as a large number of cancers of the
stomach are of a medium consistence and would be classified by some
observers as scirrhous and by others as medullary, statistics as to the
relative frequency of the different varieties have very little value.Moreover, in most statistics upon this point there is no evidence that
simple fibrous growths have not been confounded with scirrhous cancer,
and as a rule {562} little or no account is taken of cylindrical-celled
epithelioma, which is a common form of gastric cancer--according to
Cornil and Ranvier, the most common.[80]

[Footnote 80: For any who may be interested in such statistics I have
collected 1221 cases of gastric cancer, of which 791 (64.8 per cent.)were medullary, 399 (32.7 per cent.)scirrhous, and 31 (2.5 per cent.)22 cases described as epithelial have been included with the
medullary; 29 cases described as fibro-medullary, and 1 as
fasciculated, have been included with the scirrhous.The cases are from
the previously-cited statistics of Lebert, Dittrich, Wrany, Eppinger,
Gussenbauer, and V. Winiwarter, and from Fenger (_Virchow u. Hirsch's
Jahresbericht_, 1874, Bd.Cancer of the stomach may grow in the form of a more or less complete
ring around the circumference of the stomach, or as a circumscribed
tumor projecting into the cavity of the stomach, or as a diffuse
infiltration of the walls of the stomach.The annular form of growth is
observed most frequently in the pyloric region.Cancerous tumors which
project into the interior of the stomach are sometimes broad and
flattened, sometimes fungoid in shape, but most frequently they appear
as round or oval, more rarely irregular, crater-like ulcers, with
thickened, prominent walls and ragged floor.The free surface of the
tumor presents sometimes a cauliflower-like or dendritic appearance,
which characterizes the so-called villous cancer.Diffuse cancerous
infiltration is seated oftenest in the right half of the stomach, but
it may occupy the cardiac region or even the entire stomach.The relation of the cancerous growth to the coats of the stomach varies
in different cases.The tumor usually begins in the mucous membrane and
rapidly extends through the muscularis mucosae into the submucous coat.In this lax connective-tissue coat the tumor spreads often more rapidly
than in the mucous membrane, so that it may appear as if the cancer
originated in the submucosa.The mucous membrane, however, is usually
invaded, sooner or later, over the whole extent of the tumor.The dense
muscular coat offers more resistance to the invasion of the tumor.Cancerous masses, however, penetrate along the connective-tissue septa
between the muscular bundles, which often increase in number and size.In the muscular coat thus thickened can be seen the opaque white
fibrous and cancerous septa enclosing the grayish, translucent bundles
of smooth muscular tissue.Often, however, the whole muscular coat
beneath the tumor is replaced by the cancerous growth, and can no
longer be recognized.The serous and subserous connective tissue, like
the submucous coat, offers a favorable soil for the growth of the
tumor, which here appears usually in the form of large and small
nodules projecting from the peritoneum.Adhesions now form between the
stomach and surrounding parts, and opportunity is offered for the
continuous growth of the cancer into these parts.In the manner
described the tumor grows in all directions, sometimes more in depth,
sometimes more laterally, sometimes more into the interior of the
stomach.Ulceration occurs in all forms of gastric cancer.[81] The ulceration is
caused either by fatty degeneration and molecular disintegration of the
surface of the tumor or by the separation of sloughy masses.Doubtless
the solvent action of the gastric juice aids in the process.The softer
and {563} the more rapid the growth of the cancer, the more extensive
is likely to be the ulcer.Such ulcers are usually round or oval in
shape, but their contours may be irregular from the coalescence of two
or more ulcers or from serpiginous growth.The edges are usually high,
soft in consistence, and often beset with polypoid excrescences.The
floor is generally sloughy and soft, and often presents warty
outgrowths.The edges and floor may, however, be hard and smooth.In
the more slowly-growing scirrhous and colloid cancers the ulcers are
more likely to be superficial.Partial cicatrization of cancerous
ulcers may take place.The development of cicatricial tissue may
destroy the cancerous elements to such an extent that only by careful
microscopical examination can the distinction be made between cancer
and simple ulcer or fibroid induration.The examination of secondary
cancerous deposits in adjacent lymphatic glands or other parts becomes,
then, an important aid in the diagnosis.[Footnote 81: Ulceration was present in 60 per cent.of Lebert's cases,
and in 66-1/2 per cent.of Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter's pyloric
cancers.]Suppuration has been known to occur in gastric cancers, but it is
extremely rare.Each form of gastric cancer has certain peculiarities which require
separate consideration.Medullary carcinoma grows more rapidly than the other varieties of
cancer.It forms usually soft masses, which project into the stomach
and are prone to break down in the centre and develop into the
crater-like ulcers already described.All of the coats of the stomach
are rapidly invaded by the growth.The consistence of the tumor is
soft, the color upon section whitish or reddish-gray, sometimes over a
considerable extent hemorrhagic.Milky juice can be freely scraped from
the cut surface of the tumor.The so-called villous cancer and the
haematodes fungus are varieties of medullary carcinoma.Medullary
carcinoma is more frequently accompanied by metastases than the other
forms.In consequence of its tendency to deep ulceration medullary
cancer is more liable to give rise to hemorrhage and to perforation
than is scirrhous or colloid cancer.The continuous new formation of
cancerous tissue in the floor of the ulcer and the formation of
adhesions, however, greatly lessen the danger of perforation into the
peritoneal cavity.Histologically, medullary cancer is composed of a scanty stroma of
connective tissue enclosing an abundance of cancerous alveoli filled
with polyhedrical or cylindrical epithelial cells.The stroma is often
richly infiltrated with lymphoid cells, and contains blood-vessels
which often present irregular dilatations of their lumen.Waldeyer describes with much detail, for this as for the other forms of
gastric cancer, the origin of the tumor from the gastric tubules.According to his description, a group of gastric tubules, ten to twenty
in number, sends prolongations downward into the submucous coat.These
tubular prolongations are filled with proliferating epithelial cells,
which make their way into the lymphatic spaces of the surrounding
tissue and give origin to the cells in the cancerous alveoli.A
small-celled infiltration of the surrounding connective tissue
accompanies this growth of the tubules.The tissue beneath and at the margins of medullary cancer may be
predominantly fibrous in texture and contain comparatively few
cancerous alveoli.This scirrhous base is often exposed after the
destruction of the greater part of the soft cancer by ulceration and
sloughing.It is {564} probable that many of the scirrhous cancers are
formed in this way secondarily to medullary cancer (Ziegler).Cylindrical-celled epithelioma presents the same gross appearances and
the same tendency to ulceration and to the formation of metastases
which characterize medullary cancer.The consistence of cylindrical
epithelioma may, however, be firm like that of scirrhus.Not
infrequently the alveoli are distended with mucus secreted by the
lining epithelium, and then the tumor presents in whole or in part
appearances similar to colloid cancer.Upon microscopical examination are seen spaces resembling more or less
closely sections of tubular glands.These spaces are lined with
columnar epithelium.Often in certain parts of the tumor the alveolar
spaces are filled with cells, so that the structure is a combination of
that of ordinary cancer and of epithelioma.The stroma is generally
scanty and rich in cells, but it may be abundant.Cysts may be present
in this form of tumor, and in one case I have found such cysts nearly
filled with papillary growths covered with cylindrical epithelium, so
that the appearance resembled closely that of the so-called proliferous
cysto-sarcoma of the breast.The origin of cylindrical epithelioma from the gastric tubules is
generally accepted, and is more readily demonstrable than the similar
origin claimed for the other forms of gastric cancer.Scirrhous cancer assumes often the form of a diffuse thickening and
induration of the gastric walls, particularly in the pyloric region,
where it causes stenosis of the pyloric orifice.Scirrhus may, however,
appear as a circumscribed tumor.Irregular hard nodules frequently
project from diffuse scirrhous growths into the interior of the
stomach.Scirrhous cancer and medullary cancer are often combined with
each other.The dense consistence of scirrhous cancer is due to the predominance of
the fibrous stroma, the cancerous alveoli being relatively small in
size and few in number.Colloid cancer generally appears as a more or less uniform thickening
of the gastric walls.All of the coats of the stomach are converted
into the colloid growth.Nearly the whole of the stomach may be invaded
by the new growth.[82] The tumor has a tendency to spread to the omenta
and to the rest of the peritoneum, where it may form enormous masses,
but it rarely gives rise to metastases in the interior of organs.Colloid cancer may, however, form a circumscribed projecting tumor in
the stomach, and in rare instances it causes abundant secondary colloid
deposits in the liver, the lungs, and other parts.[Footnote 82: In a case reported by Storer the whole stomach, except a
little of the left extremity over an extent of about an inch, was
converted into a colloid mass in which no trace of the normal coats of
the stomach could be made out.The colloid growth replacing the gastric
wall measured seven-eighths of an inch in thickness in the pyloric
region.Digestion was less disturbed in this case than in most cases of
gastric cancer (_Boston Med.In
Amidon's case (reported in the _Trans.38) there seems to have been an equally extensive colloid
metamorphosis of the stomach.]Colloid cancer presents, even to the naked eye, an exquisite alveolar
structure, whence the name alveolar cancer as a designation of this
tumor.Bands of opaque white or gray connective tissue enclose alveolar
meshes which are filled with the gelatinous, pellucid colloid {565}
substance.This colloid material is thought to be produced by a colloid
transformation of the epithelial cells in the alveoli, but the same
transformation seems to occur also in the stroma.Few or no intact
epithelial cells may be found in the alveoli.Colloid metamorphosis may
take place in all forms of gastric cancer, but it is particularly
common in cylindrical epithelioma.Colloid cancer may originate in the
peritoneum unconnected with any glandular structures.It occurs often
at an earlier age than other forms of cancer.Deep ulceration rarely
attacks colloid cancer.Flat-celled epithelioma is found at the cardiac orifice and as a
metastatic growth in other parts of the stomach.Originating in the
oesophagus, it may extend downward into the stomach.By noting whether
the structure is that of squamous or of cylindrical epithelioma it is
often possible to determine whether a tumor at the cardiac orifice
originates in the oesophagus or in the stomach.Secondary cancer of the stomach, although rare, is not such a curiosity
as is often represented.Without aiming at completeness, I have been
able to collect 37 cases of secondary cancer of the stomach, of which
the larger number will stand critical examination.[83] Of these cases,
17 were secondary to cancer of the breast, 8 to cancer of the
oesophagus, 3 to cancer of the mouth or nose, and the remainder to
cancer of other parts of the body.The large number of cases secondary
to cancer of the breast is explained by the large statistics relating
to mammary cancer which were consulted.Gastric cancer is more
frequently secondary to cancer of the oesophagus than to cancer of any
other part.In this category of course are not included cases of
continuous growth of oesophageal cancer into the stomach, but only
metastatic cancers of the stomach.A part at least of the gastric
cancers secondary to cancer of the alimentary tract above the stomach I
refer, with Klebs, to implantation in the mucous membrane of the
stomach of cancerous particles detached from the primary growth in the
oesophagus, pharynx, or mouth.This view is supported by the absence in
some cases of any involvement of the lymphatic glands.The secondary
deposits in the stomach conform in structure to the primary growth.They are usually situated in the submucous coat, where they form one or
often several distinctly circumscribed tumors.The secondary tumors may
or may not ulcerate.[Footnote 83: These cases are from Dittrich, 2 (the remainder of his
cases I rejected); Cohnheim, 1; Petri, 2; Klebs, 3; Lucke, 1; Weigert,
1; Coupland, 1; Cruse, 1; Hausmann, 1; Bartholow, 1; Oldekop, 5; Edes,
1; V. Torok and V. Wittelshofer, 8; Grawitz, 4; Haren Noman, 5.So-called melanotic cancers, cancers involving only the serous coat of
the stomach, and those extending by continuous growth into the stomach,
are not included in this list.]Primary cancers may be present at the same time in different organs of
the body; for instance, in the uterus and in the stomach.[84] The
possibility of multiple primary cancers is to be borne in mind in
considering some of the apparently secondary cancers of the stomach, as
well as in determining whether certain cancers are secondary to gastric
cancer or not.Here the microscopical examination is often
decisive.[85]

[Footnote 84: Case of A. Clark's (_Trans.260), and a similar one reported by J. B. S. Jackson in _Extr.[Footnote 85: The subject of multiple primary cancers is considered by
Kauffmann (_Virchow's Arch._, Bd.317), and by Beck (_Prager
med.Wochenschr._, 1883, Nos.V. Winiwarter reports a
cancer of the stomach in a patient who died one year seven and a half
months after extirpation of a cancer of the nose.He regards the case
as one of multiple primary cancer.]{566} Gastric cancer often causes important secondary changes in the
coats and the lumen of the stomach.In the neighborhood of the tumor
are often found hypertrophy of the muscular coat and fibrous thickening
of the submucous coat.Polypoid hypertrophy of the mucous membrane near
the cancer is not rare.Not only near the tumor, but over the whole
stomach, chronic catarrhal gastritis usually exists.The most important alterations are those dependent upon obstruction of
the orifices of the stomach.This obstruction may be caused either by a
tumor encroaching upon the orifice or by an annular thickening of the
walls of the orifices.Even without apparent stenosis, destruction of
the muscular layer at or near the pylorus may be an obstacle to the
propulsion of the gastric contents into the duodenum.As a result of
obstruction of the pyloric orifice the stomach becomes dilated,
sometimes enormously, so as to occupy most of the abdominal cavity.The
walls of the dilated stomach, particularly the muscular coat, are
usually thickened, but exceptionally they are thinned.Sometimes with
pyloric stenosis the stomach is reduced in size.This occurs
particularly when a scirrhous growth extends diffusely from the pyloric
region over a considerable part of the stomach.Obstruction of the
cardiac orifice or in the oesophagus leads to atrophy of the stomach,
although here also there are exceptions.Above the obstruction the
oesophagus is often dilated.An existing obstruction may be reduced or
removed by ulceration or sloughing of the tumor.Both dilatation and contraction of the stomach may attend gastric
cancer without any involvement of the orifices of the stomach in the
cancerous growth.The cavity of the stomach may be so shrunken by
scirrhous thickening and contraction of the gastric walls that it will
hardly contain a hen's egg.Irregular deformities in the shape of the
stomach, such as an hour-glass shape and diverticular recesses, may be
caused by gastric cancer.Changes in the shape of the stomach and the weight of the tumor may
cause displacements of pyloric cancers, so that these tumors have been
found in nearly all regions of the abdomen, and even in the true
pelvis.[86] Such displaced cancers usually contract adhesions with
surrounding parts.[Footnote 86: Lebert, _op.It is not necessary to dwell upon the formation of adhesions which may
bind the stomach to nearly all of the abdominal organs, most frequently
to the liver, the pancreas, the intestine, and the anterior abdominal
wall.Adhesions of pyloric cancers are found in at least two-thirds of
the cases, and probably oftener.[87]

[Footnote 87: Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter found adhesions recorded in
370 out of 542 pyloric cancers.In considering the propriety of
resection of gastric cancers it has become a matter of importance to
know in what proportion of cases adhesions are present.I agree with
Ledderhose and with Rydygier in believing that adhesions are present
oftener than appears from Gussenbauer and V. Winiwarter's statistics.The fact that adhesions are not noted in post-mortem records of gastric
cancer cannot be considered proof of their absence.Little has been
done in the study of gastric cancer from a surgical point of view.Metastases and adhesions were absent in only 5 out of 52 cases of
pyloric cancer in which either pylorectomy or exploratory laparotomy
was performed (Rydygier).]Cancer of the stomach in the majority of cases is accompanied with
{567} metastases in other parts of the body.In 1120 cases of gastric
cancer secondary cancers were present in 710, or 63.4 per cent., and
absent in 410, or 36.6 per cent.[88] In about two-thirds of the cases,
therefore, secondary deposits were present.[Footnote 88: These cases are from Habershon, _op.i.; and Gussenbauer and Von
Winiwarter, _loc.cit._]

In order to determine the relative frequency of the secondary deposits
in various organs of the body, I have constructed the following table,
based upon an analysis of 1574 cases of cancer of the stomach in which
the situation of the metastases were given:[89]

  Lymphatic glands.551  35.0%
  Liver.475  30.2%
  Peritoneum, omentum, and intestine.357  22.7%
  Pancreas.122   7.8%
  Pleura and lung.98   6.2%
  Spleen.26   1.7%
  Brain and meninges.9   0.6%
  Other parts of the body.92   5.8%

[Footnote 89: These cases include, in addition to those cited in the
preceding foot-note, those of Dittrich (_Prager Vierteljahrschr._, vol.), Wrany (_ibid._, vols.Metastases in the intestine formed only
a small number of those under the heading peritoneum, omentum, and
intestine, but as they were all included together in Gussenbauer's
large statistics, the intestinal metastases could not well be placed
separately.In 673 cases the peritoneum and omentum were cancerous in
21.7 per cent.]Secondary cancerous deposits are probably even more frequent in the
lymphatic glands than appears from the table.In 1153 cases of gastric
cancer in which the situation of the affected lymphatic glands is
specified, the abdominal glands, and chiefly those near the stomach,
were the seat of cancer in 32-1/2 per cent.In Lange's 210 cases the
cervical glands were affected in 4.3 per cent.In other statistics this
percentage is much smaller.In nearly one-third of the cases there are
secondary cancers in the liver.These may attain an enormous size in
comparison with the tumor of the stomach.Cancer of the peritoneum and
of the omentum is found in about one-fifth of the cases of gastric
cancer.The spleen is rarely involved, except by continuous growth of a
cancer of the fundus or in cases of widespread distribution of cancer
through the aortic circulation.Cancer of the liver increases the
liability to metastases in the lungs, but the latter may be present
without any cancerous deposits in the liver.Secondary cancers may be
present in the suprarenal capsules, the kidneys, the ovaries, the
heart, the thoracic duct, the bones, the skin, etc.In an interesting
case reported by Finlay[90] the subcutaneous tissue of the trunk was
thickly studded with small nodules, of which two were excised during
life and found to be cylindrical epitheliomata.This led to the
diagnosis of a primary tumor of the same nature in the stomach or in
the intestine.At the autopsy was found a cylindrical epithelioma of
the stomach which had not given rise to characteristic symptoms.Secondary cancer of the intestine is rare if the deposits in the
peritoneal coat be {568} excepted.Several cancerous ulcers or multiple
cancerous nodules may be found along the intestinal tract, involving
the mucous and the submucous coats.[91] These metastases seem best
explained by the theory of implantation of cancerous elements which
have been carried from the primary growth in the stomach into the
intestine.In some of the cases the idea of multiple primary cancers
may also be entertained.Unfortunately, in Roseler's case of multiple skin-cancers with an
ulcerated cancer of the stomach no microscopical examination of the
skin-nodules was made.The interpretation of this case is therefore
doubtful (_Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.[Footnote 91: Cases in point are recorded by Wrany (_loc.cit._), Blix
(_Virchow u. Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1876, ii.207), Lange,
Katzenellenbogen, and Lebert.]It is not rare for gastric cancer to cause secondary deposits in the
stomach itself.Sometimes it is difficult to decide which of two or
more cancers in the stomach is the primary growth, as in Ripley's case
of ulcerated cancer of the cardiac orifice with a similar growth around
the pyloric orifice.[92] It is probable that in very rare instances
multiple primary cancers may develop in the stomach.[Footnote 92: J. H. Ripley, _Trans.Maurizio has also reported a case of scirrhous cancer of the cardia
with scirrhous cancer of the pylorus (_Annal.di Medicina_, Oct.,
1869).A similar case was observed by Barth (_Gaz.hebdom._, 1856, No.Cancerous metastases are produced by the transportation of cancerous
elements by the lymphatic current or by the blood-current.In a number
of instances the portal vein or some of the branches which help to form
it have been found plugged with a cancerous mass which may or may not
be organized.[93] The cancer in these cases has burst through the walls
of the vessel into the lumen, where it may grow both in the direction
and against the direction of the current.On serous surfaces, and
probably also, although rarely, on mucous surfaces, secondary cancers
may develop from cancerous particles detached from a parent tumor and
scattered over the surface as a kind of seminium.[Footnote 93: Cases of this kind have been reported with especial
fulness by Spaeth (_Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.432), Acker
(_Deutsches Arch.173), and Audibert (_De la
Generalisation du Cancer de l'Estomac_, Paris, Thesis, 1877).]Mention has already been made of the invasion of parts adjacent to the
stomach by the continuous growth of gastric cancer.In this way
lymphatic glands, the liver, the pancreas, the omenta, the transverse
colon, the spleen, the diaphragm, the anterior abdominal wall, the
vertebrae, the spinal cord and membranes, and other parts may be
involved in the cancerous growth.Under the head of Complications reference has already been made to
various lesions which may be associated with gastric cancer.As regards
the manifold complications caused by perforation of gastric cancer, in
addition to what has already been said the article on gastric ulcer may
be consulted.In general, the various fistulous communications caused
by gastric cancer are less direct than those produced by gastric ulcer.The wasting of various organs of the body in cases of gastric cancer
may be found on post-mortem examination to be extreme.Habershon
mentions a case in which the heart of a woman forty years old weighed
only 3-1/2 ounces after death from cancer of the pylorus.As in other
profoundly anaemic states, the embryonic or lymphoid alteration of the
marrow of the bones is often present in gastric cancer.PATHENOGENESIS.--The problems relating to the ultimate causation and
origin of gastric cancer belong to the pathenogenesis of cancer in
general.Our knowledge with reference to these points is purely
hypothetical.It will suffice in this connection simply to call
attention to {569} Virchow's doctrine, that cancer develops most
frequently as the result of abnormal or of physiological irritation,
hence in the stomach most frequently at the orifices; and to Cohnheim's
theory, that cancer as well as other non-infectious tumors originate in
abnormalities in development, more specifically in persistent embryonic
cells.According to the latter view, gastric cancer develops only in
those whose stomachs from the time of birth contain such embryonic
remnants.These unused embryonic cells may lie dormant throughout life
or they may be incited to cancerous growth by irritation, senile
changes, etc.According to Cohnheim's theory, the orifices of the
stomach are the most frequent seat of cancer on account of complexity
in the development of these parts.For a full consideration of these theories the reader is referred to
the section of this work on General Pathology.DIAGNOSIS.--The presence of a recognizable tumor in the region of the
stomach outweighs in diagnostic value all other symptoms of gastric
cancer.The detection of fragments of cancer in the vomit or in
washings from the stomach is of equal diagnostic significance, but of
rare applicability.The discovery of secondary cancers in the liver, in
the peritoneum, or in lymphatic glands may render valuable aid in
diagnosis.Of the local gastric symptoms, coffee-ground vomiting is the
most important.The relation between the local and the general symptoms
may shed much light upon the case.While anorexia, indigestion,
vomiting, and epigastric pain and tenderness point to the existence of
a gastric affection, the malignant character of the affection may be
surmised by the development of anaemia, emaciation, and cachexia more
rapid and more profound than can be explained solely by the local
gastric symptoms.The value to be attached in the diagnosis of gastric
cancer to the absence of free hydrochloric acid from the contents of
the stomach must still be left sub judice.The age of the patient, the
duration, and the course of the disease are circumstances which are
also to be considered in making the diagnosis of gastric cancer.These
symptoms of gastric cancer have already been fully considered with
reference to their presence and absence and to their diagnostic
features.It remains to call attention to the differential diagnosis between
gastric cancer and certain diseases with which it is likely to be
confounded.The points of contrast which are to be adduced relate
mostly to the intensity and the frequency of certain symptoms.There is
not a symptom or any combination of symptoms of gastric cancer which
may not occur in other diseases.Hence the diagnosis is reached by a
balancing of probabilities, and not by any positive proof.Notwithstanding these difficulties, gastric cancer is diagnosed
correctly in the great majority of cases, although often not until a
late stage of the disease.Errors in diagnosis, however, are
unavoidable, not only in cases in which the symptoms are ambiguous or
misleading, but also in cases in which all the symptoms of gastric
cancer, including gastric hemorrhage and tumor, are present, and still
no gastric cancer exists.Cases of the latter variety are of course
rare.In the absence of tumor the diseases for which gastric cancer is most
liable to be mistaken are gastric ulcer and chronic gastric catarrh.In
the following table are given the main points of contrast between these
three diseases: {570}

{571} The diagnosis between gastric cancer and gastric ulcer is more
difficult than that between cancer and gastritis, and sometimes the
diagnosis is impossible.The differential points mentioned in the table
are of very unequal value.An age under thirty, profuse hemorrhage, and
absence of tumor are the most important points in favor of ulcer;
tumor, advanced age, and coffee-ground vomiting continued for weeks are
the most important points in favor of cancer.As cancer may have been
preceded by ulcer or chronic gastritis for years, it is evidently
unsafe to trust too much to the duration of the illness.As has already
been said, it is best to place no reliance in the differential
diagnosis upon the character of the pain.Any peculiarities of the
vomiting, the appetite, or the digestion are of little importance in
the differential diagnosis.Cachexia is of more importance, but it is
to be remembered that ulcer, and even chronic gastritis in rare
instances, may be attended by a cachexia indistinguishable from that of
cancer.Cases might be cited in which very decided temporary
improvement in the symptoms has been brought about in the course of
gastric cancer, so that too much stress should not be laid upon this
point.Enough has been said under the Symptomatology with reference to
the diagnostic bearings of the absence of free hydrochloric acid from
the stomach, of the presence of cancerous fragments in fluids from the
stomach, and of secondary cancers in different parts of the body.One must not lose sight of the fact that the whole complex of symptoms,
the order of their occurrence, and the general aspect of the case, make
an impression which cannot be conveyed in any diagnostic table, but
which leads the experienced physician to a correct diagnosis more
surely than reliance upon any single symptom.In the early part of the disease there may be danger of confounding
gastric cancer with nervous dyspepsia or with gastralgia, but with the
progress of the disease the error usually becomes apparent.What has
already been said concerning the symptomatology and the diagnosis of
gastric cancer furnishes a sufficient basis for the differential
diagnosis between this disease and nervous affections of the stomach.Chronic interstitial gastritis or fibroid induration of the stomach
cannot be distinguished with any certainty from cancer of the stomach.Fibroid induration of the stomach is of longer duration than gastric
cancer, and it is less frequently attended by severe pain and
hemorrhage.Sometimes a hard, smooth tumor presenting the contours of
the stomach can be felt, but this cannot be distinguished from diffuse
cancerous infiltration of the stomach.Non-malignant stenosis of the pylorus is of longer duration than cancer
of the pylorus.The symptoms of dilatation of the stomach are common to
both diseases.Cicatricial stenosis is the most common form of
non-malignant pyloric stenosis.This is usually preceded by symptoms of
gastric ulcer which may date back for many years.Non-malignant
stenosis more frequently occurs under forty years of age than does
cancer.The diagnosis between malignant and non-malignant stenosis of
the pylorus is in some cases impossible.Although the surest ground for the diagnosis of gastric cancer is the
appearance of tumor, there are cases in which it is difficult to decide
whether the tumor really belongs to the stomach, and even should it be
{572} established that the tumor is of the stomach, there may still be
doubt whether or not it is cancerous.The diagnosis between cancerous and non-cancerous tumors of the
stomach, such as sarcoma, fibroma, myoma, etc., hardly comes into
consideration.The latter group of tumors rarely produces symptoms
unless the tumor is so situated as to obstruct one of the orifices of
the stomach.Even in this case a positive diagnosis of the nature of
the tumor is impossible.Of greater importance is the distinction between cancerous tumors of
the stomach and tumors produced by thickening of the tissues and by
adhesions around old ulcers of the stomach.Besides the non-progressive
character of the small and usually indistinct tumors occasionally
caused by ulcers or their cicatrices, the main points in diagnosis are
the age of the patient and the existence, often for years, of symptoms
of gastric ulcer antedating the discovery of the tumor.The long
duration of symptoms of chronic catarrhal gastritis and of dilatation
of the stomach is also the main ground for distinguishing from cancer a
tumor produced by hypertrophic stenosis of the pylorus.Tumors of organs near the stomach are liable to be mistaken for cancer
of the stomach.The differential diagnosis between gastric cancer on
the one hand, and tumors of the left lobe of the liver and tumors of
the pancreas on the other hand, is often one of great difficulty.Tumors of the liver are generally depressed by inspiration, whereas
tumors of the stomach are much less frequently affected by the
respiratory movements.The percussion note over tumors of the liver is
flat, while a tympanitic quality is usually associated with the dulness
over tumors of the stomach.Light percussion will often bring out a
zone of tympanitic resonance between the hepatic flatness and the
dulness of gastric tumors.Gastric tumors are usually more movable than
hepatic tumors.By palpation the lower border of the liver can perhaps
be felt and separated from the tumor in case this belongs to the
stomach.Most of the points of distinction based upon these physical
signs fail in cases in which a gastric cancer becomes firmly adherent
to the liver.The basis for a diagnosis must then be sought in the
presence or the absence of marked disturbance of the gastric functions,
particularly of haematemesis, vomiting, and dilatation of the stomach.On the other hand, ascites and persistent jaundice would speak in favor
of hepatic cancer.There are cases in which the diagnosis between
hepatic cancer and gastric cancer cannot be made.This is especially
true of tumors of the left lobe of the liver, which grow down over the
stomach and compress it, and which are accompanied by marked
derangement of the gastric functions.The frequency with which cancer
of the stomach is associated with secondary cancer of the liver should
be borne in mind in considering the diagnosis.There are certain symptoms which in many cases justify a probable
diagnosis of cancer of the pancreas, but this disease can rarely be
distinguished with any certainty from cancer of the stomach.The
situation of the tumor is the same in both diseases.With pancreatic
cancer the pain is less influenced by taking food, the vomiting is less
prominent as a symptom, and anorexia, haematemesis, and dilatation of
the stomach are less common than with gastric cancer.Of the positive
symptoms in {573} favor of cancer of the pancreas, the most important
are jaundice, fatty stools, and sugar in the urine.Of these symptoms
jaundice is the most common.Should there be any suspicion that the tumor is caused by impaction of
feces, a positive opinion should be withheld until laxatives have been
given.Mistakes may occur as to the diagnosis between gastric cancer and
tumors of the omenta, the mesentery, the transverse colon, the
lymphatic glands, and even the spleen or the kidney.Encapsulated
peritoneal exudations near the stomach have been mistaken for gastric
cancer.Where a mistake is likely to occur each individual case
presents its own peculiarities, which it is impossible to deal with in
a general way.Of the utmost importance is a careful physical
exploration of the characters and relations of the tumor, aided, if
necessary, by artificial distension of the stomach or of the colon by
gas (see page 549).No less important is the attentive observance of
the symptoms of each case.In doubtful cases fluids withdrawn from the
stomach by the stomach-tube should be carefully examined for cancerous
fragments, and the gastric fluids may be tested for free hydrochloric
acid by methods already described.Pyloric cancers which receive a marked pulsation from the aorta
sometimes raise a suspicion of aneurism, but the differential diagnosis
is not usually one of great difficulty.Gastric cancer when it presses
upon the aorta may simulate aneurism, not only by the presence of
pulsation, but also by the existence of a bruit over the tumor.The
tumor produced by aneurism is generally smoother and rounder than that
caused by cancer.The pulsation of an aneurism is expansile, but the
impulse of a tumor resting upon an artery is lifting and generally
without lateral expansion.The impulse transmitted to a tumor resting
upon the abdominal aorta may be lessened by placing the patient upon
his hands and knees.Sometimes the tumor can be moved with the hands
off from the artery, so that the pulsation momentarily ceases.A severe
boring pain in the back, shooting down into the loins and the lower
extremities, and not dependent upon the condition of the stomach,
characterizes abdominal aneurism, but is not to be expected in gastric
cancer.With aneurism gastric disorders and constitutional disturbance
are much less prominent than with cancer of the stomach.[94]

[Footnote 94: In a case of pulsating pyloric cancer observed by Bierner
the symptoms were much more in favor of aneurism than of cancer.The
cancer had extended to the retro-peritoneal glands, which partially
surrounded and compressed the aorta.There were marked lateral
pulsation of the tumor, distinct systolic bruit, diminution of the
femoral pulse, and severe lancinating pain in the back and sacral
region.With the exception of vomiting, the gastric symptoms were
insignificant.The patient was only thirty-three years old (Ott, _Zur
Path.des Magencarcinoms_, Zurich, 1867, p.Spasm of the upper part of the rectus abdominis muscle may simulate a
tumor in the epigastric region.The diagnosis is made by noting the
correspondence in shape and position between the tumor and a division
of the rectus muscle, the superficial character of the tumor, the
effect of different positions of the body upon the distinctness of the
tumor, the tympanitic resonance over the tumor, and, should there still
be any doubt, by anaesthetizing the patient, when the phantom tumor
will disappear.Spasm of the rectus muscle has been observed in cases
of cancer of the stomach.{574} Attention is also called to the possibility of mistaking in
emaciated persons the head of the normal pancreas, or less frequently
the mesentery and lymphatic glands, for a tumor.[95] As emaciation
progresses the at first doubtful tumor may even appear to increase in
size and distinctness.[Footnote 95: In the case of the late Comte de Chambord the diagnosis
of gastric cancer was made upon what appeared to be very good grounds.No cancer, however, existed, and the ill-defined tumor which was felt
during life in the epigastric region proved to be the mesentery
containing considerable fat (Vulpian, "La derniere Maladie de M. le
Comte de Chambord."It is sufficient to call attention to the danger of mistaking, in cases
where the gastric symptoms are not prominent and no tumor exists,
gastric cancer for pernicious anaemia, senile marasmus, or the chronic
phthisis of old age.In some of these cases the diagnosis is
impossible, but the physician should bear in mind the possibility of
gastric cancer in the class of cases here considered, and should search
carefully for a tumor or other symptom which may aid in the diagnosis.The possibility of mistaking gastric cancer accompanied with peritoneal
exudation for cirrhosis of the liver or for tubercular peritonitis is
also to be borne in mind.The diagnosis of the position of the cancer in the stomach can usually
be made in cases of cancer of the cardia or of the pylorus.The
symptoms diagnostic of cancer of the cardia are dysphagia,
regurgitation of food, obstruction in the passage of the oesophageal
bougie, and sinking in of the epigastric region in consequence of
atrophy of the stomach.It has already been said that catheterization
of the oesophagus does not always afford the evidence of obstruction
which one would expect.Cancerous stenosis of the cardia is to be
distinguished from cicatricial stenosis in this situation.The
diagnosis is based upon the history of the case, which is generally
decisive, and upon finding fragments of cancer in the tube passed down
the oesophagus.That the cancer is seated at the pylorus is made evident by the
situation of the tumor (see p.561) and by the existence of dilatation
of the stomach.There are many more causes of stenosis of the pylorus
than of stenosis of the cardia, so that, notwithstanding the absence of
tumor, cancer of the cardia is often more readily diagnosticated than
cancer of the pylorus.The greatest difficulty in diagnosis is presented by cancers which do
not obstruct the orifices of the stomach.Many of these cancers run an
almost latent course so far as the gastric symptoms are concerned, and
in case they produce no recognizable tumor and are unattended with
hemorrhage, the difficulties in their diagnosis are almost
insurmountable.In general, a diagnosis of the particular form of cancer which is
present cannot be made, nor is such a diagnosis of any practical value.In very exceptional cases such a diagnosis might be made by the
examination of secondary subcutaneous cancers[96] or of fragments found
in the fluids obtained from the stomach.[Footnote 96: As for example, in Finlay's case, already referred to (p.It is not safe to trust implicitly in this criterion, as the
subcutaneous tumors may be of a different nature from the tumor of the
stomach, as in an interesting case observed by Leube (_op.Although the diagnosis of gastric cancer can generally be made before
the death of the patient, unfortunately a positive diagnosis in the
early stages of the disease is usually impossible.Should resection of
cancer {575} of the stomach become a legitimate operation in surgery,
it will be of the utmost importance to make the diagnosis in an early
stage of the disease.Only those cases are suitable for resection in
which there are no secondary deposits, the general health of the
patient is in fair condition, and extensive adhesions have not been
formed.It was to be hoped that the ingenious instrument devised by
Mikulicz for exploring the interior of the stomach by electrical
illumination would prove a valuable aid in diagnosis.The gastroscope
in its present construction, however, has proved of little value.[97]
It is, moreover, difficult to manipulate, and is not free from danger
to the patient.We may be permitted, however, to hope for improvement
in this direction.[Footnote 97: Mikulicz has observed with the gastroscope in a case of
pyloric cancer immobility of the pylorus and absence of rugae in the
mucous membrane of the pyloric region (_Wiener med.Wochenschr._, 1883,
No.It does not seem probable that there can be anything peculiar
to cancer in these appearances.]In cases in which there is reasonable suspicion of the existence of
gastric cancer, and in which there is proper ground to contemplate
resection of the tumor, it is justifiable to make an exploratory
incision into the abdomen.It can then be decided whether or not cancer
exists, and whether the case is suitable for operation.When this
incision is made with all of the precautions known to modern surgery,
it is attended with little or no danger,[98] and it should not be made
except by surgeons who are practically familiar with these precautions.[Footnote 98: Of 20 exploratory incisions for tumor of the stomach
performed by Billroth, not one had ended fatally (_Deutsche med.Wochenschrift_, 1882, ii.).]PROGNOSIS.--There is no proof that cancer of the stomach has ever ended
in recovery.It may be admitted that partial cicatrization of gastric
cancer may occur.We have, however, no sufficient reason to believe
that cancer of the stomach has ever been completely destroyed by any
process of nature or by any medicinal treatment.A successful resection of a cancer of the pylorus by Billroth in
January, 1881, made a great sensation in the medical world.Since that
time the operation has been performed successfully ten times, and with
fatal issue twenty-seven times.A radical cure has not, however, been
effected, although life has been prolonged for a year and a half after
the operation.[99] The possibility of permanent cure of gastric cancer
by extirpation must be admitted.Enthusiasm over this possibility,
however, is seriously lessened by the fact that a radical cure is not
to be expected unless the operation is undertaken when the tumor is of
small size, has produced no distant metastases, is free from many
adhesions, and the patient is not greatly prostrated.In view of the
difficulty of diagnosis in the early stages it is not likely that these
favorable conditions can be fulfilled except in the rarest instances.Metastases may already exist when the tumor is small and before it has
given rise to any symptoms.[100] Pylorectomy, moreover, will probably
be successful in the hands of only comparatively few surgeons.It is
therefore but a feeble glimmer of hope {576} which is now admitted to
the hitherto relentlessly fatal forecast of this disease.[Footnote 99: Several of the patients are still living (1884), but, so
far as I can learn, no patient has survived the operation more than a
year and a half.][Footnote 100: Birch-Hirschfeld relates a case in which a non-ulcerated
cancerous tumor not larger than a silver half-dollar was found in the
pyloric region of the stomach of a woman who died from injury.The
tumor had given rise to no symptoms.Nevertheless, numerous metastases
existed in the lymphatic glands of the omentum and of the lesser
curvature (_Jahresb.d. gesellschaft f. Natur u. Heilk.im Dresden_
[1882-83], 1883, p.TREATMENT.--Even up to the present time various drugs have been vaunted
as effecting a radical cure of cancer of the stomach.Some of these,
such as mercury, are positively harmful; others, such as conium,
belladonna, and condurango, are often palliative; but not one has been
proven to be curative.Since its recommendation by Friedreich in 1874,
condurango has enjoyed the greatest vogue.The few observations in
which, under the use of this agent, tumors, real or apparent, of the
stomach have lessened in size or disappeared, admit of other
interpretations than as cures of gastric cancer.There is, however,
considerable testimony as to the virtues of condurango as a stomachic.In some cases it relieves the pain, vomiting, and indigestion of
gastric cancer, but in many cases it is employed without benefit.The
drug which passes by the name of condurango in the market is a very
variable preparation.According to Friedreich's directions, decoction
of condurango is prepared as follows: Macerate oz.condurango for twelve hours with fluidounce xij of water; then boil
down to fluidounce vj and strain.The dose is a tablespoonful two or
three times daily.The decoction of condurango may be combined with
syr.While all specific treatment of gastric cancer is to be abandoned, much
can be done for the relief and comfort of the patient.In general, the indications are similar to those in gastric ulcer.It
is not necessary, however, to restrict the diet to the same extent as
in gastric ulcer.The patient's tastes may be consulted to a
considerable extent.Still, it will be found, as a rule, that the
patient is most comfortable when his diet is confined to
easily-digestible substances, such as milk, beef-juice, Leube's
beef-solution, rare beefsteak, and other articles mentioned under the
treatment of gastric ulcer.The pain of gastric cancer will usually require the administration of
opium in some form.There is manifestly not the same objection to the
employment of narcotics in a necessarily fatal disease like cancer as
in ulcer of the stomach.Opium may be given in pill form or as the
tincture or deodorized tincture, or often most advantageously as
hypodermic injections of morphia, to which atropia may be added.Vomiting is sometimes controlled by regulation of the diet,
particularly by iced milk.For this symptom also opium or morphia is
often necessary.In addition, the customary remedies for relief of
vomiting, such as bits of ice, iced champagne, soda-water, hydrocyanic
acid, oxalate of cerium, creasote, may be tried.Cold or hot
applications to the abdomen and mild counter-irritants, such as mustard
plaster or turpentine stupes, sometimes afford relief.If the vomiting
be incoercible, it may be well to administer food for a short time
exclusively by the rectum, and in case of stenosing cancer of the
cardia this method of administering food may be the only one possible.Acid eructations and heartburn are often relieved by the antacids, as
bicarbonate of sodium, lime-water, or calcined magnesia.Against
fermentative processes in the stomach have been recommended salicylate
of sodium, creasote, carbolic acid, and the alkaline hyposulphites.Charcoal tablets are as useful as, and less likely to disagree than,
other antifermentatives.{577} In view of V. d. Velden's
investigations, already mentioned, the administration of dilute
hydrochloric acid in an hour after a meal is indicated.Excellent results have been obtained by regularly washing out the
stomach in cases of gastric cancer, particularly in pyloric cancer with
dilatation of the stomach.By this procedure pain, indigestion, and
vomiting are often greatly relieved, and the patient experiences a
renewed sense of well-being.Unfortunately, the benefit is only
temporary.The syphon process is most conveniently employed.Contraindications to the use of the stomach-tube are copious
gastrorrhagia and great weakness of the patient.When constipation is not relieved by washing out the stomach, enemata
should be employed.Drastic purgatives should not be given.For diarrhoea opium may be given, particularly in the form of small
enemata of starch and laudanum.Scanty hemorrhage in the form of coffee-grounds vomiting requires no
treatment.Copious haematemesis is to be treated according to the
principles laid down under the treatment of hemorrhage from gastric
ulcer.Discussion of the surgical treatment of gastric cancer of course does
not belong to this work.The opinion entertained by the physician as to
the propriety of surgical interference in gastric cancer is not,
however, a matter of indifference, for cases of gastric cancer come
first into the hands of the physician, and generally only by his
recommendation into those of the surgeon.So long as the physician
stands absolutely powerless before this disease, his general attitude
as to the propriety of surgical interference should not be one of
hostility.Experience only can determine the justification of surgical
operation in cases of gastric cancer.As yet, it is too soon to express
a positive opinion as to the value of resection of gastric cancer.Of
37 published resections of cancer of the pylorus, 27 died from the
effects of the operation, and of the fatal cases 18 within the first
twenty-four hours.These results are certainly not calculated to awaken
much enthusiasm for the operation.Still, it would be wrong to draw
definite conclusions from the existing statistics of resection of the
cancerous pylorus, partly because the number of operations is as yet
too small, partly because the operation has been done when it was
certainly unwarrantable according to the best judges (Billroth,
Czerny), and chiefly because the number of operators in proportion to
the number of operations is too great.For the 37 published operations
there have been 27 operators.Ovariotomy was not considered a
justifiable operation until the excellent results of individual
operators were obtained.It is probable that to an even greater extent
resection of the pylorus will become the specialty of certain
operators.Therefore, before concluding as to the value of resection of
cancer of the stomach it is necessary to await the results of
individual surgeons in a series of cases.[101]

[Footnote 101: Already, from this point of view, the operation appears
more hopeful.Czerny has performed 6 resections of the stomach with
only 2 fatal results; 4 of the operations were pylorectomies for
cancer.Billroth has performed the operation 8 times with 3 fatal
results (_Wiener med.Wochenschrift_, 1884, Nos.So much, however, is now certain, that with our present means of
diagnosis the number of cases suitable for extirpation is very
small.[102] A {578} radical cure is to be expected only in the rarest
instances, so that the value of the operation will depend chiefly upon
the condition of the patient after its performance.As regards this
point, the results in the successful cases have been encouraging.In
several instances the terrible sufferings of the patient have given
place to months of comparative health and comfort.[Footnote 102: Billroth at the eleventh session of the Congress of
German Surgeons said that he was amazed at the number of resections of
the pylorus which had been performed.Out of 50 to 60 cases of gastric
cancer, only 1 appeared to him suitable for operation.]In cases of extreme cancerous stenosis of the pylorus which are not
suitable for resection Wolfler proposed forming a fistulous
communication between the stomach and the small intestine
(gastro-enterostomy).The results of the operation have not been
encouraging.Out of six cases in which this operation has been
performed, only two patients lived after the operation.For the same condition Schede proposed making a duodenal fistula
(duodenostomy), but I am not aware that the operation has been
performed.The results of gastrostomy for relief of cancerous stenosis of the
cardia or of the oesophagus have not been encouraging.[103]

[Footnote 103: Of 76 cases of gastrostomy for the relief of cancer of
the oesophagus or of the cardia, only 14 lived over thirty days
(Leisrink and Alsberg, _Arch.Non-Cancerous Tumors of the Stomach.Little clinical interest attaches to non-cancerous tumors of the
stomach.They are comparatively rare and usually unattended by
symptoms.Even should a tumor be discovered, there are no means of
determining the nature of the tumor; and if symptoms are produced by
the tumor, the case will probably be diagnosticated as one of cancer.It is necessary, therefore, in the present work to do little more than
enumerate the different forms of non-cancerous tumor of the stomach.The most common of benign gastric tumors are polypi projecting into the
interior of the stomach.These are usually so-called mucous or
adenomatous polypi, being composed of hypertrophied or hyperplastic
elements of the mucous membrane with or without new growth of submucous
tissue.They may be present in large number (one hundred and fifty to
two hundred in a case of Leudet's).Their development is usually
attributed to a chronic catarrhal gastritis, so that a gastritis
polypora has been distinguished.These polyps are important only when
they obstruct one of the orifices of the stomach, in which case they
may cause even fatal stenosis.Benign adenomata appear less frequently as growths in the submucous
coat of the stomach (Winiwarter).Myomata and myosarcomata, projecting sometimes as polyps either into
the gastric or the peritoneal cavity, may attain a very large size, as
in a case reported by Brodowski in which a cystic myosarcoma of the
stomach weighed twelve pounds.[104]

[Footnote 104: _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.Sarcoma, either as a primary or a secondary tumor of the stomach, is
rare.Two cases of secondary lympho-sarcoma of the stomach (primary of
the retro-peritoneal glands) without gastric symptoms have come under
my observation.In a similar case reported by Coupland the symptoms
resembled those of gastric cancer.[105]

[Footnote 105: _Trans.{579} In connection with gastric ulcer mention has already been made of
the occurrence of miliary aneurisms in the stomach, which may be the
cause of fatal haematemesis.Sometimes the mucous membrane is studded with little cysts, as in a
case reported by Harris.[106]

[Footnote 106: _Am.Fibromata and lipomata are very rare.Foreign bodies in the stomach, particularly balls of hair, have been
sometimes mistaken for tumors, particularly cancer, of this organ.Schonborn removed successfully a ball of hair from the stomach by
gastrotomy.[107] Before the operation the tumor was considered to be a
movable kidney.{580}

HEMORRHAGE FROM THE STOMACH.BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.Hemorrhage from the stomach is a symptom, and not a disease.It is a
result of a great variety of morbid conditions in the description of
which it receives more or less consideration.Already the
symptomatology and treatment of hemorrhage from the stomach have been
considered in connection with its two most important causes--namely,
gastric ulcer and gastric cancer.It remains to give a summary of the
etiology and diagnosis of gastric hemorrhage.Hemorrhage from the stomach is also called gastrorrhagia.The term
haematemesis is not synonymous with gastric hemorrhage, for blood may
be vomited which has simply been swallowed or has passed from the
intestine into the stomach.ETIOLOGY.--The causes of gastric hemorrhage are as follows:

1.Ulcer of the Stomach.--Simple gastric ulcer is the most frequent
cause of abundant hemorrhage from the stomach.Tuberculous gastric
ulcers, typhoid gastric ulcers, and the ulcers of phlegmonous gastritis
are extremely rare causes of hemorrhage.Hemorrhagic erosion of the
stomach, which by many writers is assigned an important place in the
etiology of gastric hemorrhage, is not an independent affection, and in
my opinion is without any clinical significance.Cancer of the Stomach.--(Non-cancerous tumors of the stomach hardly
deserve mention in this connection, so infrequently are they the cause
of gastric hemorrhage.)Traumatism (mechanical, chemical, thermic).--_a_.Acting from
without the stomach: severe injury to the abdomen, as by a blow or a
fall; penetrating wounds of the stomach.Acting from within the stomach: foreign bodies, particularly
sharp-pointed ones; corrosive poisons, as acids and alkalies; other
toxic inflammatory irritants; and very hot substances.Here should also
be mentioned injury from an inflexible stomach-tube and aspiration of
mucous membrane with the stomach-pump.Diseases of the Gastric Blood-vessels.--_a_.Aneurism of the
arteries of the stomach.Miliary aneurisms have been found by Galliard
and others as a cause of profuse and even fatal hemorrhage from the
stomach.Especially in obscure cases should careful search be made for
miliary aneurisms.Varices of the veins are a not unimportant cause of gastric
hemorrhage.They are most frequently associated with chronic passive
{581} congestion of the stomach, but they may be found without any
apparent disturbance of the circulation.Degenerations of the vessels, particularly fatty and atheromatous
degeneration of the arteries.Probably gastric hemorrhage in
phosphorus-poisoning is to be attributed to fatty degeneration of the
arteries.Amyloid degeneration of the blood-vessels is a doubtful cause
of hemorrhage.Active Congestion of the Stomach.--Here is usually placed gastric
hemorrhage as a result of severe inflammation of the stomach (as acute
catarrhal gastritis), although in these cases the inflammatory
alteration of the vascular walls is an equally important factor.With more probability the so-called vicarious hemorrhages from the
stomach are to be assigned to active congestion.Sceptical as one is
inclined to be as regards vicarious hemorrhages of the menses, the
occurrence of such hemorrhages, although rare, must be admitted.Doubtful, however, are alleged cases of gastric hemorrhage taking the
place of suppressed hemorrhoidal bleeding or of epistaxis.Passive Congestion of the Stomach.--This embraces an important group
of causes of gastric hemorrhage.This hemorrhage is the result of
venous congestion caused by some obstruction to the portal circulation.The obstruction may be--

_a_.In the portal vein itself or its branches within the liver, as in
pylethrombosis, cirrhosis of the liver, tumors, such as cancer or
echinococcus cysts, compressing the portal vein, occlusion of
capillaries in the liver by pigment-deposits in melanaemia, and
dilatation of the bile-ducts in the liver from obstruction to the flow
of bile.Next to ulcer and to cancer of the stomach, cirrhosis of the
liver is the most frequent and important cause of gastrorrhagia.In the pulmonary blood-vessels, as in pulmonary emphysema, chronic
pleurisy, and fibroid induration of the lungs.In the heart in consequence of uncompensated valvular and other
diseases of the heart.For evident reasons, obstruction of the pulmonary or of the cardiac
circulation is much less likely to cause gastric hemorrhage than is
obstruction in the portal vein or the liver.Possibly, gastric hemorrhage which is caused by violent acts of
vomiting may be caused by venous congestion of the mucous membrane of
the stomach.In support of this view, Rindfleisch advances the idea
that the veins in the muscular layers of the stomach, in consequence of
the thinness of their coats, are much more likely than the arteries to
suffer from the compression of the muscle during its contraction.The occasional occurrence of gastric hemorrhage during pregnancy has
also been attributed to passive congestion of the stomach.Acute Infectious Diseases--namely, yellow fever, acute yellow
atrophy of the liver, relapsing fever; less frequently cholera, typhoid
fever, typhus fever, diphtheria, erysipelas, and the exanthematous
fevers, small-pox, measles, and scarlet fever.The cause of gastric hemorrhage in these diseases is not understood.The usual explanation attributes the hemorrhage to dissolution of the
blood-corpuscles and secondary alteration of the walls of the
blood-vessels.Plugging of the vessels with micro-organisms has been
found {582} in only a few instances.The gastrorrhagia of acute yellow
atrophy of the liver has been attributed to dissolution of the blood,
not only by some infectious agent, but also by constituents of the
bile, and also to obstruction of the portal circulation by destruction
and occlusion of capillaries in the liver.Hemorrhagic
diatheses--namely, scorbutus, purpura, and haematophilia.Strictly
speaking, a hemorrhagic diathesis exists in other affections of this
class.Here we may distinguish, first, periodical malarial
hemorrhages from the stomach which are cured by quinia; second,
pernicious gastric malarial fever, of very grave prognosis; and third,
hemorrhages in malarial cachexia due to extreme anaemia.Cases which
have been described as malaria with scorbutic complications belong
mostly to the last variety.Mention has already been made of gastric
hemorrhages attributed to malarial pigmentation of the liver.The most important affections in this category
are progressive pernicious anaemia, leucocythaemia, and
pseudo-leucocythaemia, including the so-called splenic anaemia.The hemorrhage is attributed to dissolution of the
blood-corpuscles by the action of the biliary salts.Gastric hemorrhage is a rare event in Bright's disease, occurring more
especially with small kidneys.In one such case I found that the fatal
hemorrhage was due to the bursting of a miliary aneurism of a small
artery in the submucous coat.Probably in all similar cases the
hemorrhage is referable to disease of the vascular walls.Neuropathic Conditions.--Although ecchymoses in the mucous membrane
of the stomach can be experimentally produced by injury of various
parts of the brain and spinal cord, there is no proof that gastric
hemorrhage which is of any clinical importance is referable to
structural diseases of the nervous system.The occasional occurrence of
gastric hemorrhage in progressive paralysis of the insane, in
tuberculous meningitis, in epilepsy, is to be attributed to other
causes.In lack of a better explanation, however, the gastric hemorrhages which
have been occasionally observed in hysterical women may be classified
here.These constitute not the least important class of gastric
hemorrhages.The hemorrhages from the stomach in chlorosis belong
partly here and partly to anaemia.Melaena Neonatorum.--Although in some cases ulcers have been found
in the stomach or duodenum, and in others a general hemorrhagic
diathesis exists, it must be said that the etiology of this grave
disease is still very obscure.Bursting of Aneurisms or of Abscesses from without into the
Stomach.Idiopathic Causes.--Under this unsatisfactory designation are
included cases which are aptly described by Flint[1] in the following
words: "Hemorrhage sometimes occurs from the stomach, as from the
bronchial tubes, the Schneiderian membrane, and in other situations,
without any apparent pathological connections, neither following nor
preceding any appreciable morbid conditions.It is then to be
considered {583} as idiopathic."A person in apparent health has
suddenly a hemorrhage, often profuse, from the stomach, which is
followed only by symptoms immediately referable to the hemorrhage.The
hemorrhage is naturally the source of great anxiety.Ulcer or cancer of
the stomach or some other grave disease is usually suspected.But the
patient develops no further symptoms, and often never has another
hemorrhage.Whatever hypotheses one may construct for these cases of
so-called idiopathic hemorrhage, the recognition of the clinical fact
of their occurrence is important.[Footnote 1: Austin Flint, _A Treatise on the Principles and Practice
of Medicine_, 5th ed., p.Inasmuch as hemorrhage from the stomach is usually made manifest by the
vomiting of blood, it is important to bear in mind that gastric
hemorrhage is not the only cause of haematemesis.Blood may gain access
to the stomach by being swallowed in cases of hemorrhages from the
nose, mouth, throat, bronchi, lungs, and oesophagus.Blood may also
enter the stomach from the duodenum in cases of simple ulcer of the
duodenum or of typhoid ulcers situated in the upper part of the
intestine.The SYMPTOMS of hemorrhage from the stomach have already been described
in connection with ULCER OF THE STOMACH.MORBID ANATOMY.--As is evident from the enumeration of the causes of
gastric hemorrhage, the lesions found after death are manifold.A
description of these lesions, however, does not belong here.It is
necessary, however, to say a few words concerning the demonstration of
the source of the hemorrhage.The hemorrhage is arterial, venous, or capillary in origin.Ulcerations
from the stomach into the heart, which have been mentioned in
connection with gastric ulcer, are too infrequent to come into
consideration in this connection.If the bleeding is from a large
artery or vein or from a medium-sized aneurism or varix, the
demonstration of its source is not difficult.Often, however, in cases
of fatal gastric hemorrhage the search for the source of the hemorrhage
has proved fruitless.It is supposed that in many such cases the
hemorrhage is due to diapedesis, and not to rupture of a blood-vessel
(rhexis).Doubtless, small gastric hemorrhages, particularly those into
the tissues of the stomach, are often the result of diapedesis, but in
cases of profuse hemorrhages from the stomach where the source of the
hemorrhage is not demonstrable after death, the convenient assumption
of hemorrhage by diapedesis, in my opinion, plays too important a role.In most cases of profuse gastrorrhagia the symptoms point to a sudden
outpouring of blood into the stomach; and our knowledge of diapedesis
does not warrant the belief that the red blood-corpuscles can escape
through the unsuffused walls of the vessels with that combined rapidity
and abundance which would be necessary to explain the sudden and
profuse hemorrhage.In these cases hemorrhage by rhexis is altogether
more probable even when ruptured vessels cannot be demonstrated.It
often requires a long-continued and careful search to find a small
vessel which is ruptured.In the case above mentioned of fatal
haematemesis from miliary aneurism over an hour of continuous searching
was required to find the pinhole perforation in the mucous membrane in
the bottom of which lay the small aneurism.Chiari[2] has reported a
fatal gastric hemorrhage due to rupture of a submucous vein.The
erosion of the mucous membrane was not larger than a hempseed.The
examination of the mucous membrane is often much impeded by the {584}
closely-adherent mucus and blood, which have to be carefully removed.Injection of the vessels of the stomach with fluid may aid in finding a
ruptured vessel.It is not intended to assert that in all cases of
fatal gastric hemorrhage a painstaking search would reveal the source
of the hemorrhage, but it is believed that cases of fatal gastric
hemorrhage would less frequently be reported with negative anatomical
result as hemorrhages by diapedesis, or by exhalation, or as
parenchymatous or capillary hemorrhages, if such a search were made.Wochenschr._, 1882, No.DIAGNOSIS.--Undoubtedly, small hemorrhages into the stomach often occur
which are not recognized, and in the absence of vomiting even larger
hemorrhages may escape detection unless a careful examination of the
stools be made.The patient may die from abundant gastric hemorrhage
before any blood has been vomited or has passed by the bowels.When there is doubt whether the black color of the stools is due to
blood or to the administration of iron or of bismuth, it generally
suffices to add water to the stools.If blood be present, the water
will acquire a reddish color.Should doubt still remain, then the
microscope, the spectroscope, or the test for haemin crystals may be
called into requisition (see p.Whether black, tarry stools are produced by hemorrhage from the stomach
or by hemorrhage in the upper part of the intestine can be decided only
by the clinical history.If haematemesis be likewise present, the
presumption is strongly in favor of gastric hemorrhage.The diagnosis,
however, between hemorrhage from duodenal ulcer and that from gastric
ulcer is very difficult, and can rarely be positively made.The mere inspection of the vomit is generally sufficient to determine
whether it contain blood or not.Color more or less resembling that of
altered blood may be produced in the vomit by iron, bismuth, red wine,
various fruits, such as cranberries, and by bile.When a careful
inspection by the physician leaves doubt as to the presence of
blood--which will rarely be the case--then here also recourse may be
had to the microscope, spectroscope, and test for haemin crystals.Sometimes blood is swallowed and then vomited by hysterical females or
by malingering soldiers or prisoners for purpose of deceit.In such
cases there are generally no evidences of acute anaemia or of gastric
disease.The blood of some animals can be distinguished by the
microscope from human blood.When suspicion of deceit exists, there are
generally various ways of entrapping the patient.When blood is vomited by nursing infants the possibility of its coming
from the breast of the mother is to be thought of.Sometimes blood from the nose or throat is swallowed, particularly when
the bleeding occurs during the night.This blood may subsequently be
vomited.The inspection of the nose or throat will generally reveal the
source of the hemorrhage in such cases.The diagnosis between hemorrhage from the oesophagus and that from the
stomach must be based upon the clinical history.The oesophagoscope,
however, has been successfully employed for diagnostic purposes.Several cases have been reported of fatal hemorrhage from varices of
the oesophagus.Such hemorrhage cannot be distinguished from gastric
hemorrhage.Much more frequently arises the question whether the hemorrhage is from
the stomach or from the lungs.Sometimes the decision of this point
{585} is very difficult, and it may even be impossible, especially when
the physician is obliged to trust only to the statements of the patient
or his friends.Difficulty in the diagnosis results mainly from the
fact that coughing and vomiting of blood are often associated with each
other.With haemoptysis blood may be swallowed and then vomited, and
with haematemesis more or less coughing occurs.The diagnosis is to be
based upon the points contained in the following table:

          HAEMOPTYSIS.|          HAEMATEMESIS.Usually preceded by symptoms

As it is important that the patient should be as quiet as possible
during and for some time after the hemorrhage, any physical examination
which disturbs the patient, such as percussing the posterior part of
the chest or palpating the abdomen, should be avoided.The diagnosis of the many causes of gastric hemorrhage belongs to the
description of the various diseases which have been enumerated under
the etiology.PROGNOSIS.--It is exceptional for gastric hemorrhage to prove
immediately fatal.According to Fox, such an occurrence is more
frequent with cirrhosis of the liver than with ulcer or cancer of the
stomach.The ultimate result of the hemorrhage depends greatly upon the
previous condition of the patient.If this condition was good, he often
rallies from the most desperate prostration immediately following the
hemorrhage.A previously enfeebled patient is of course more likely to
yield to the further anaemia and exhaustion caused by profuse
hemorrhage.Although the symptoms of gastric ulcer and of cirrhosis of
the liver are sometimes improved after hemorrhage from the stomach,
nevertheless this hemorrhage can never be regarded as a welcome event.For the treatment of gastric hemorrhage see ULCER OF THE STOMACH.{586}

DILATATION OF THE STOMACH.BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.DEFINITION.--By dilatation of the stomach is understood a condition in
which the stomach is abnormally large and is unequal to the performance
of its normal functions.It will be observed that this definition of
dilatation of the stomach includes an anatomical disturbance and a
physiological disturbance.A stomach which, although unusually large,
performs its functions perfectly well is not, in the clinical sense, a
dilated stomach.The most characteristic functional disturbance in
dilatation of the stomach is delay in the propulsion of the gastric
contents into the intestine in consequence of inability of the muscular
coat of the stomach to perform the work imposed upon it.This muscular
insufficiency, whether primary or secondary, necessarily involves
disorder of the digestive and absorptive powers of the stomach.SYNONYMS.--Dilatatio ventriculi; Gastrectasia.It has been proposed to
call the early stages of the disease insufficiency of the stomach
(Rosenbach).The condition described by Chomel as dyspepsia of liquids
is undoubtedly dilatation of the stomach.HISTORY.--Dilatation as a disease of the stomach is not mentioned by
writers of antiquity.Fabricius ab Aquapendente in 1623 was among the
first to record an observation of dilatation of the stomach.During the
following century cases of dilatation of the stomach were recorded more
as curiosities than as of clinical interest.Most cases were attributed
to eating or drinking inordinate quantities.In 1743, Widman clearly
recognized stenosis of the pylorus as a cause of gastric dilatation.In
the works of Van Swieten, Morgagni, Lieutaud, and J. P. Frank, during
the latter half of the last century, different causes of dilatation of
the stomach are recognized.The last writer especially distinguishes
clearly between dilatation due to stenosis and that due to atony.The
data as to the symptoms of the disease were still very imperfect.In
1833, Duplay[1] published an important article in which the main points
in the causation and symptomatology of dilatation of the stomach are
clearly described.After this time the important works on the practice
of medicine or on diseases of the stomach contain, in the main, correct
descriptions of the disease under consideration.Since the publication
in 1869 of Kussmaul's memorable article[2] on the treatment of
dilatation of the stomach by the {587} stomach-pump, much greater
attention has been paid to this disease than ever before, so that the
literature upon this subject during the last fifteen years is very
considerable.In 1875, Penzoldt published an excellent monograph upon
dilatation of the stomach.[3]

[Footnote 1: _Arch.[Footnote 2: _Deutsches Arch.Kussmaul
first employed the stomach-pump in dilatation of the stomach in 1867,
and in that year he reported a successful result (_Schmidt's Jahrb._,
Bd.[Footnote 3: _Die Magenerweiterung_, Erlangen, 1875.To this work I am
indebted for most of the historical data in the text.]ETIOLOGY.--Dilatation of the stomach is the result of inability of this
organ to propel its contents into the intestine within the normal space
of time.In the performance of this mechanical work three factors are
involved--namely, the muscular force of the stomach, the quantity and
quality of the gastric contents, and the size of the opening between
the stomach and the intestine.All causes of dilatation of the stomach
may be referred to abnormalities of one or more of these factors.The most important group of causes is represented by stenosis of the
pyloric orifice or of the adjacent part of the stomach or of the
intestine.[4] Most cases of hypertrophic dilatation of the
stomach--that is, dilatation with hypertrophy of the muscular walls of
the stomach--are produced by causes belonging to this group.[Footnote 4: Dilatation of the stomach in consequence of intestinal
obstruction below the duodenum is so rare that no further attention is
given to the subject in the present article.The term pyloric stenosis
is often used in the course of the article to include any obstruction
to the passage of the contents of the stomach into the intestine,
whether the obstruction be in the duodenum, the pyloric orifice, or the
pyloric region.]The most frequent cause of pyloric stenosis is carcinoma, either in the
form of a diffuse infiltration of the gastric walls in this region or
as a tumor projecting into the cavity of the pyloric portion of the
stomach.Next in frequency are cicatricial growths resulting from
simple ulcer involving the pyloric region.Much less frequent are
similar cicatricial stenoses of the pylorus resulting from ulcers
produced by swallowing corrosive poisons.Simple hypertrophy of the
coats of the stomach in the pyloric region, particularly of the fibrous
and muscular coats, is an occasional cause of dilatation.Obstruction
of the pylorus by mucous polypi or by hypertrophic folds of mucous
membrane is so rare as to have little practical interest.Likewise,
stenosis caused by sarcomata, fibromata, myomata, lipomata, and cysts
need be mentioned only for the sake of completeness.Narrowing of the pyloric orifice may be caused also by pressure from
outside of the stomach, as by tumors, particularly cancer, of the liver
and of the pancreas, and by the contraction of fibrous adhesions and
thickenings resulting from perigastritis.Obstruction of the duodenum
by tumors growing in its walls, by cicatrices resulting from ulcers,
and by external pressure may also cause dilatation of the stomach.According to Barker, compression of the duodenum by a wandering right
kidney may induce dilatation of the stomach.The mere association of
dilatation of the stomach and movable right kidney, however, cannot be
considered proof that the former is caused by the latter, for the
subjects of movable kidney (most frequently women with flabby abdominal
walls who have borne many children) are often also favorable subjects
for atonic dilatation of the stomach.Sometimes with dilatation of the stomach the pyloric orifice is found
abnormally small, without any thickening or other appreciable change in
the walls of the pylorus.These cases in adults have been described by
{588} Landerer under the name of congenital stenosis of the pylorus,
but his conclusions are not free from doubt.[5] Congenital stenosis,
and even complete occlusion of the pylorus, has been observed in
infants.[6]

[Footnote 5: _Ueber angeborene Stenose des Pylorus_, Inaug.Diss.,
Tubingen, 1879.In the ten cases studied by Landerer the patients were
all adults, mostly in advanced life.In only one case is it mentioned
that indigestion existed from childhood; the clinical history in all is
incomplete.With the exception of one case there was no marked
hypertrophy of the muscular coat of the stomach, such as is usually
found with benign pyloric stenosis and would naturally be expected with
a stenosis existing since birth.The pyloric orifice varied from 1-1/2
cm.Some of the specimens had been in alcohol for
a considerable time.In my opinion, Landerer has not brought forward
sufficient proof that in these cases stenosis of the pylorus existed
since birth.][Footnote 6: Wunsche, _Jahrb.d. Kinderheilk._, viii.Andral, Forster, and Bull have found congenital stenosis and atresia of
the pylorus.]Spasm of the pyloric muscle, which, according to Kussmaul, may be
referable to erosions, ulcers, and inflammations of the adjacent mucous
membrane, can be admitted only as a hypothetical explanation of some
cases of dilatation of the stomach.Somewhat problematical, although not improbable, is the production of
stenosis of the pylorus or of the duodenum by torsion and by
displacement of these parts.Dilatation of the stomach is sometimes
associated with scrotal hernia, particularly with that containing
omentum or transverse colon.This dilatation Kussmaul explains by the
production of a sharp bend between the movable first part and
comparatively fixed second part of the duodenum, in consequence of the
dragging downward of the stomach by the displaced omentum or transverse
colon.In a similar way Kussmaul believes that the weight of an
over-distended stomach may produce stenosis, and by this mechanism he
explains the occasional occurrence of symptoms of complete pyloric
obstruction when a large quantity of material has accumulated in an
already dilated stomach, and the prompt relief of these symptoms when
the burden of the stomach is removed either by vomiting or by the
stomach-tube.[7]

[Footnote 7: Another explanation given by Kussmaul, and likewise based
upon experiments on the cadaver, is that when the stomach is
over-distended it may rotate upon its own axis, so that the pylorus
acquires a sagittal direction and impinges against the first part of
the duodenum.This rotation of the stomach, however, can occur only
when the abdominal walls are flabby (Kussmaul, "Die Peristaltische
Unruhe des Magens," _Volkmann's Samml.The manner in which stenosis of the pylorus causes dilatation of the
stomach is sufficiently obvious to require no especial explanation.It
is, however, important to know that stenosis of the pylorus may be
compensated, so that even a very considerable degree of obstruction of
this orifice may exist without any dilatation of the stomach.The
obstruction may be completely counteracted by hypertrophy of the
muscular coat of the stomach, particularly of that in the right half of
the organ.Leube suggests that this increased muscular force, by
increasing the peristaltic movements, may also hasten the digestion and
absorption of the food, so far as these processes take place in the
stomach.[8] The timely removal of the contents of the stomach by
vomiting may also prevent over-distension of the organ.Another
compensatory circumstance may be the reduction of the quantity of solid
and liquid food taken by the patient.Conditions are often present,
however, which oppose the development of these {589} compensatory
circumstances.Such conditions are feebleness of the patient,
degeneration of the muscular coat of the stomach, chronic catarrhal
gastritis, insufficient secretion of gastric juice, and delayed
absorption, causing stagnation and fermentation of the food in the
stomach.[Footnote 8: Leube, in _V.Dilatation of the stomach may occur without any obstacle to the
evacuation of the gastric contents into the intestine.The cases of
so-called atonic dilatation of the stomach belong to this class.The
degree of dilatation in these cases is rarely so great as when the
dilatation is caused by stenosis.The cause of gastric dilatation in
the absence of stenosis is not always clear, so that a variety of
hypotheses, more or less probable, have been broached to explain these
obscure cases.Dilatation with unobstructed outlet of the stomach must be referable
either to abnormalities in the quantity or quality of the contents of
the stomach or to weakness of the muscular walls of the stomach.In
most cases both of these causes are combined, and it is not easy to
separate their action.Abnormal gastric contents may be the result of improper ingesta or of
disturbances in gastric digestion.Although in former times the
frequency of excessive eating and drinking as a cause of dilatation of
the stomach was doubtless exaggerated, nevertheless the efficacy of
this cause cannot be doubted.Dilatation of the stomach is said to be
common in people who live almost exclusively upon a vegetable diet and
therefore require large quantities of food.The habitual drinking of
large quantities of beer may cause dilatation of the stomach.The
occasional association of a dilated stomach with diabetes is referred
to the inordinate appetite and thirst which characterize this disease.If the food reaches the stomach imperfectly masticated, the process of
digestion is delayed, and as a result the stomach may become dilated.Indigestible food, particularly that which readily ferments in the
stomach, may be an indirect cause of the disease under consideration.A
similar role may be played by swallowing foreign substances either by
accident or by design.It is not proven that dilatation of the stomach
may be referable to exhaustion of its muscular power by the abuse of
agents which at first excite peristalsis, such as emetics, purgatives,
alcoholics, tobacco, spices, etc.Equally doubtful is the production of
dilatation by the misuse of narcotics, such as opium, which restrain
peristalsis.Of great importance in the production and continuance of gastrectasia
are all circumstances which cause stagnation and fermentation of the
contents of the stomach.These abnormalities of the gastric contents
are referable both to muscular and to chemical insufficiency of the
stomach, but in this connection it is desired to call attention
especially to chemical insufficiency, although in the production of
gastric dilatation this becomes always associated with muscular
insufficiency.In this way chronic catarrhal gastritis is operative in
the causation of gastric dilatation.In consequence of insufficient
secretion of normal gastric juice and of delayed absorption, the food
remains abnormally long undigested in the stomach, and fermentative
changes, with the development of gas, occur.No less important,
however, is the impairment of the muscular power of the stomach in
chronic gastritis.Stagnation and fermentation of the contents of the
stomach occur also in functional or atonic dyspepsia, which is to be
reckoned as a cause of dilatation of the stomach.{590} Naunyn[9]
emphasizes especially the importance of abnormal fermentations in the
stomach (alcoholic, butyric acid, lactic acid, acetic acid
fermentations) both as a cause and as a result of dilatation of the
stomach.Ulcer and cancer of the stomach may cause dilatation by
interfering with the normal digestive processes.[Footnote 9: _Deutsches Arch.We come now to the third and final group of causes of dilatation of the
stomach--namely, those included under weakness of the muscular walls of
the stomach.In the last analysis all causes of gastric dilatation come
under this heading, for even with pyloric stenosis and with excessive
contents a stomach will not dilate so long as its muscular power is
equal to the proper performance of the work which is demanded.In this
connection, however, reference is had especially to those cases in
which impairment or restraint of the muscular movements of the stomach
may be regarded more or less directly as the primary cause of
dilatation of the stomach.Clearest of comprehension are those cases in which the muscular power
of the stomach is impaired by organic changes in the muscular coat.Here may be mentioned partial destruction of the muscular coat,
particularly of that in the pyloric region, by ulcers and by cancers.Thus, ulcers and cancers which in no way obstruct the outlet of the
stomach may cause dilatation of the organ.Inflammatory infiltration
(inflammatory oedema) of the muscular coat has been adduced as a cause
of its weakness in chronic catarrhal gastritis and in peritonitis.Whether this is the proper explanation or not, there is no doubt that
the muscular coat of the stomach may become paretic in cases of chronic
catarrhal gastritis, as well as the subjacent muscle in inflammations
of other mucous membranes, as in laryngitis or in cystitis.Our
knowledge of the relation between degeneration of the muscular coat of
the stomach and gastrectasia is very imperfect.Fatty and colloid
degeneration of the muscle of dilated stomachs is probably to be
interpreted as a secondary change.It is probable that amyloid
degeneration may be a cause of atonic dilatation of the stomach.[10]
Oedematous infiltration of the coats of the stomach in cases of
cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary emphysema, cardiac disease, and
Bright's disease has been assigned as a cause of gastric dilatation,
but without satisfactory evidence.Chronic interstitial gastritis
(cirrhosis of the stomach) is more frequently a cause of contraction
than of dilatation of the stomach.[Footnote 10: Edinger, _ibid._, Bd.The restraint of the muscular movements of the stomach by adhesions and
by dragging downward of the organ in hernia may cause dilatation.Relaxation of the abdominal walls, as in women who have borne many
children, by removing the normal support of the stomach, has been
thought to cause dilatation.Atony of the muscular walls of the stomach may be a part of general
muscular weakness and impaired nutrition.Here belong cases of adynamic
dilatation of the stomach secondary to typhoid fever, cholera,
tuberculosis, anaemia, chlorosis, cachexia, senile marasmus,
neurasthenia.Whether primary paralysis of the stomach can occur or not is wholly
uncertain.We have no positive knowledge as to the occurrence of
paresis of the stomach in consequence of organic or functional changes
{591} in the peripheral or central nervous system.Nor does our meagre
information as to the relation between the nervous system and the
muscular movements of the stomach justify the construction of any
hypotheses as to this point.For the sake of clearness the various causes of dilatation of the
stomach according to the foregoing classification may be recapitulated
as follows.Some of the more doubtful and of the rarer causes are
omitted:

  A. Stenosis of the Pylorus or of the Duodenum.Cancerous;
    2.Cicatricial;
    3.Hypertrophic (of pylorus);
    4.From external pressure;
    5.B. Abnormalities in Contents of Stomach.Ingesta:
      _a_.Excessive;
      _b_.Imperfectly masticated;
      _c_.Stagnation and fermentation in consequence of chemical
         insufficiency of the stomach, as in chronic catarrhal
         gastritis and functional dyspepsia.C. Impairment of Muscular Force of Stomach.Organic changes in muscular coat:
      _a_.Partial destruction by ulcers and cancers;
      _b_.Inflammation, as in chronic catarrhal gastritis and
             peritonitis;
      _c_.Degenerations (fatty, colloid, amyloid);
      _d_.;
      _e_.Mechanical Restraint:
      _a_.By adhesions;
      _b_.Impaired Nutrition and General Muscular Weakness, Adynamic
         dilatation from typhoid fever, tuberculosis, anaemia, etc.As a rule, not a single one, but several, of the above-mentioned causes
are operative in the production of dilatation of the stomach, and it is
often impossible to say which is the primary cause.The various gastric
functions are so dependent upon each other that if one is disturbed the
others also suffer.If, for instance, atony of the muscular coat of the
stomach exists, then in consequence of enfeebled peristalsis the
secretion of gastric juice is insufficient, the food is not thoroughly
mingled with the gastric juice, and the absorption of the products of
digestion in the stomach is interfered with; in consequence of which
the accumulating peptones still further hinder the digestive process.The pylorus remains contracted for an abnormal length of time, as it
naturally is closed until the process of chymification in the stomach
is far advanced, and this process is now delayed.The stagnating
contents of the stomach readily ferment, and the irritating products of
fermentation induce a chronic {592} catarrhal gastritis, which further
impairs the functions of the mucous and muscular coats of the stomach.Thus, in a vicious circle one cause of dilatation induces another.To
assign to each cause its appropriate share in the production of the
final result is a matter of difficulty, and often of impossibility.From this point of view the dispute as to whether in atonic dilatation
the most important factor in causation is chemical insufficiency of the
stomach (impaired secretion of gastric juice, fermentations) or
mechanical insufficiency (weakened muscular action, stagnation),
appears of little practical importance.Of the causes of non-stenotic dilatation of the stomach, the first
place is to be assigned to chronic catarrhal gastritis and to atonic
dyspepsia, as this term is understood by most English and American
writers.As regards frequency, gastric dilatation is a common result of cancer
of the pylorus.It is less frequently caused by simple ulcer.Other
forms of pyloric stenosis than the cancerous and the cicatricial are
rare.Opinions differ as to the frequency of non-stenotic or atonic
dilatation of the stomach according to the manner in which one
interprets the cases.Non-stenotic dilatations which are comparable in
degree to those produced by stenosis are rare.The lesser grades of
atonic dilatation, however, are not rare; but here arises the
difficulty of distinguishing these cases from mere chemical or
mechanical insufficiency of the stomach, which often represents the
early stage of the process.Hence it has been proposed to discard
altogether the term dilatation, and to substitute that of insufficiency
of the stomach.But this latter term is applicable to many affections
of the stomach other than dilatation.A typical case of atonic
dilatation of the stomach is a well-defined disease, and because it is
difficult to diagnosticate its early stages is not sufficient reason
for discarding altogether the designation.Gastrectasia may develop at any age.It is most frequent in middle and
advanced life.The largest number of cases of atonic dilatation is met
with between thirty and forty years of age.[11] The disease occurs in all classes of life.Atonic
dilatation seems to be comparatively more frequent in private practice
and among the favorably situated than in hospitals and among the poor.Kussmaul says that the largest contingent of patients is furnished by
persons who lead a sedentary life and eat and drink a great deal.[Footnote 11: Kundrat and Widerhofer mention no case of stenotic
dilatation of the stomach in children.They say, however, that atonic
dilatation due to over-feeding, and particularly to rachitis, is not
infrequent in children.Widerhofer reports a case of very large
dilatation of the stomach in a girl twelve years old.The cause of the
dilatation was not apparent, and the clinical history was imperfect
(_Gerhardt's Handb.d. Kinderkrankh._, Bd.Lafage
(_These_, Paris, 1881) reports a case of gastric dilatation at ten
years, and another at sixteen years of age.R. Demme (abstract in
_Berl.Wochenschr._, 1883, No.1) reports a case of large
dilatation of the stomach in a boy six and a half years old.Cicatricial stenosis was suspected.Pauli (_De Ventriculi Dilatatione_,
Frankfurt, 1839) reports an enormous dilatation of the stomach,
believed to be due to congenital stenosis.]SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Inasmuch as dilatation of the stomach is usually
secondary to some other disease, the symptoms of the primary disease
have often existed a long time before those of dilatation appear.The subjective symptoms of gastric dilatation are for the most part
directly referable to disturbances of the functions of the stomach.These {593} subjective symptoms alone do not suffice for a positive
diagnosis of the disease.Of the greatest diagnostic importance are an
examination of the vomit and a careful physical exploration of the
stomach.The appetite with dilatation of the stomach may be normal, diminished,
increased, or perverted.In the majority of cases the appetite is
diminished, and there may be complete anorexia.Sometimes the appetite
is increased even to voracity, which is explicable by the small amount
of nutriment which is absorbed.Polyphagia may therefore be a result as
well as a cause of dilatation of the stomach.Often there is excessive thirst in consequence of the small quantity of
fluid absorbed.Dilatation of the stomach in itself does not usually cause sharp
epigastric pain, although it is often associated with painful diseases
of the stomach.There is usually in the region of the stomach a sense of fulness and
weight, which is often distressing and may be accompanied with dull
pain.Heartburn and eructations of gas and of bitter or of acid fluids are
frequently present.The gas is often odorless, but sometimes it is very
offensive.In a number of
cases--which, however, are exceptional--the gas has been found
inflammable, burning usually with a colorless flame (hydrogen), but
rarely, as in a case from Frerichs' clinic, with a bright
yellowish-white flame (hydrocarbons).Detonation upon setting fire to
the gas has been noted.The analysis of the inflammable gas has shown
oxygen and nitrogen in approximately the same proportion as in the
atmosphere, in addition to large quantities of carbonic acid and of
hydrogen, also marsh gas, and in Frerichs' case olefiant gas in small
amount.[12] The oxygen and nitrogen are doubtless simply swallowed, but
the carbonic acid and hydrogen are the result of abnormal fermentations
in the stomach.The origin of the hydrocarbons in the gas is not clear,
but they are probably also produced by fermentation within the stomach.[Footnote 12: One of the analyses in Frerichs' case gave carbonic acid,
17.40; hydrogen, 21.52; marsh gas, 2.71; olefiant gas, traces; oxygen,
11.91; nitrogen, 46.44.In another analysis were found marsh gas,
10.75, and olefiant gas, 0.20.Sulphuretted hydrogen was also present
(Ewald, in _Reichert und Du Bois-Reymond's Archiv_, 1874, p.One of the most frequent symptoms, although not a constant one, of
dilatation of the stomach is vomiting.This symptom often presents
characters which, if not pathognomonic of dilatation, at least raise a
strong presumption in favor of its presence.The act of vomiting is
sometimes accomplished with such ease that it is hardly more than
regurgitation; at other times the act is accompanied with violent and
exhausting retching.A feature particularly characteristic of
dilatation of the stomach is the abundance of the vomited material.In
no other disease is such an enormous quantity evacuated from the
stomach at one time.Blumenthal relates a case in which the vomited
material amounted to sixteen pounds.Such large quantities can
accumulate in the stomach of course only when a considerable time
intervenes between the acts of vomiting.The vomiting of gastric
dilatation does not generally occur until some hours after a meal.It
often presents a certain periodicity, occurring, for instance, at
intervals of two or three days, and followed usually by temporary
relief.It is often observed that as the stomach {594} becomes larger
and larger the vomiting becomes less and less frequent, but at the same
time more abundant.Especially toward a fatal termination of the
disease the walls of the stomach may become so paralyzed and
insensible, and the patient so feeble, that the vomiting ceases
altogether.Another valuable diagnostic sign furnished by the vomit is
the presence of undigested food which has been taken a considerable
time, it may be many days, previously.[13] If the morning vomit
habitually contains undigested food which has been eaten the previous
day, gastric dilatation either exists or is almost sure to develop.[Footnote 13: Ritter relates the case of a man who vomited cherry-pits,
although he had not eaten cherries for over a year (_Canstatt's
Jahresbericht_, 1851, iii.The vomited matter is almost always in a condition of fermentation.If
the vomit be allowed to stand in a vessel, it will separate into three
layers--an upper, frothy; a middle, of turbid fluid, usually yellowish
or brownish in color; and a lower layer, composed of solid particles,
mostly alimentary debris.The vomit often emits an extremely offensive
odor.Different kinds of
fermentation--alcoholic, acetous, lactic acid, and butyric acid--are
present, usually in combination with each other.The microscope
reveals, besides undigested and partly-digested food, crystals of fatty
acids, sarcinae ventriculi, fungus-spores, and various forms of
bacteria, particularly rod-shaped ones.The connection between sarcinae
and fermentative processes is not understood.There is no evidence that
sarcinae are capable of causing fermentation.Of greater importance is
the recognition by the microscope of the spores of the yeast-fungus
(Torula cerevisiae).These spores are rarely absent, and their constant
presence is evidence that fermentation is in progress.Fermentation
often exists in undilated stomachs, but, as has already been mentioned,
it is an important factor in the production of dilatation, so that its
early recognition, if followed by proper treatment (washing out the
stomach especially), may ward off the development of dilatation.The
article on GASTRIC CANCER is to be consulted with reference to the
habitual absence of free hydrochloric acid from the stomach in cases of
cancerous dilatation.If cancer or ulcer of the stomach exists, blood
is frequently present in the vomit, but even in the absence of ulcer or
cancer or other demonstrable source of hemorrhage the vomit in cases of
dilatation of the stomach may exceptionally contain blood, even for a
considerable length of time.If the dilatation be due to pyloric
stenosis, bile is not often found in the vomited material.It has already been mentioned that vomiting is not a constant symptom
of dilatation of the stomach.It remains to add that vomiting may be
present without any of the distinctive features which have been
described.Gastric dilatation, especially in its early stages, is often
accompanied by attacks of acute indigestion (embarras gastrique) after
some indiscretion in diet.Constipation is an almost constant symptom of dilatation of the
stomach.This is naturally to be expected when so little substance
passes from the stomach into the intestine.The constipation is also to
be explained in part by the absence of the usual reflex stimulus which
the stomach during digestion normally exerts upon intestinal
peristalsis, for the constipation is usually much relieved when the
overweighted stomach is systematically washed out.{595} Occasionally, attacks of diarrhoea occur in cases of dilatation
of the stomach.The diarrhoea may perhaps be explained by the sudden
discharge of a large quantity of fermenting material from the stomach
into the intestine.With marked dilatation of the stomach, especially when there is profuse
vomiting, the urine is often considerably diminished in quantity.Particularly in cases treated by systematic washing out of the stomach,
but also in other cases, especially with abundant vomiting, the acidity
of the urine is often much reduced.The reaction may be even
continuously alkaline (Quincke).Crystals of phosphate of magnesium
have been occasionally found in the alkaline urine of gastrectasia
(Ebstein).The urine is prone to deposit abundant sediments.It often
contains an excess of indican.The patient may suffer from attacks of dyspnoea and of palpitation of
the heart in consequence of flatulent distension of the stomach.The general condition of the patient will of course depend chiefly upon
the character of the primary disease and upon the severity of the
gastric symptoms.A moderate degree of dilatation may exist without
much disturbance of the general health of the patient.But as the
disease progresses and the food stagnates more and more in the stomach,
finally to be rejected by vomiting, the patient cannot fail to lose
flesh and strength.In extreme cases of gastrectasia, even without
organic obstruction, the patient may be reduced to a degree of
emaciation and of cachexia indistinguishable from that of cancer.As in
so many other gastric diseases, the patient is usually mentally
depressed and hypochondriacal.He suffers much
from headache and vertigo.He feels incapable of physical or mental
exertion.The skin is dry and harsh; the extremities are cold.Toward
the last, cachectic oedema about the ankles can often be recognized.Kussmaul was the first to call attention to the occurrence of tetanic
spasms in cases of dilatation of the stomach.[14] This symptom has been
observed almost exclusively in an advanced stage of the disease when
the patient has become anaemic and weak.The spasms come on chiefly
after attacks of profuse vomiting or after evacuating large quantities
by the stomach-tube.The spasms may be preceded by a sense of pain or
distress in the region of the stomach, by dyspnoea, by numbness of the
extremities, or by great prostration.The tetanic spasms affect
especially the flexor muscles of the hand and forearm, the muscles of
the calves of the legs, and the abdominal muscles.The spasm may be
confined to one or more of these groups of muscles, or there may be
general tetanic contraction of the muscles of the body.Sometimes
typical epileptiform convulsions with loss of consciousness occur.With
general tetanic spasms the pupils are usually contracted, and often
irresponsive to light.Sometimes there is abnormal sensitiveness upon
pressure over the contracted muscles.The spasms may last for only a
few minutes, or they may continue for several hours, or even for days.After their disappearance the patient is left extremely prostrated.Although tetanic spasms increase the gravity of the prognosis, they are
not necessarily fatal.[Footnote 14: _Deutsches Arch.Kussmaul considers that these spasms are analogous to those occurring
in cholera, and are referable to abnormal dryness of the tissues in
consequence of the extraction of fluid.This view is supported by the
usual {596} occurrence of the spasms after profuse vomiting or after
washing out the stomach.Another explanation, which is perhaps more
applicable to the epileptiform attacks, refers the convulsions to
auto-infection by toxic substances produced in the stomach by abnormal
fermentative and putrefactive changes (Bouchard).[15]

[Footnote 15: Laprevotte, _Des Accidents tetaniformes dans la
Dilatation de l'Estomac_, These, Paris, 1884, p.Coma, with or without the peculiar dyspnoea of diabetic coma, is a rare
occurrence in gastrectasia.(For a description of this form of coma see
page 205.)The temperature in gastric dilatation is generally unaffected.Penzoldt, however, saw two cases with moderate rise of temperature in
the evening, which could not be explained by any complication.On the
other hand, abnormally low temperature with slow pulse has been
observed (Wagner).Essential to the diagnosis of gastric dilatation is the physical
examination of the stomach.If the stomach be markedly dilated, inspection may reveal an abnormal
prominence of the abdominal walls in the epigastric region and
extending a variable distance below the level of the umbilicus.This
prominence is most marked on the left side.When the abdominal walls
are sufficiently thin and relaxed, sometimes the outline of the greater
curvature between the umbilicus and pubes, less frequently that of the
lesser curvature, can be made out.Sometimes the peristaltic waves of
the stomach can be perceived through the thin abdominal walls.By
pressure or by passing the hand across the abdomen gastric peristalsis
may sometimes be excited.The peristaltic movements of the stomach,
however, are rarely perceived except when the dilatation is due to
stenosis and the muscular coat of the stomach is hypertrophied.The
peristaltic waves generally pass from left to right, rarely in the
opposite direction as well.Careful attention to the situation,
direction, and extent of these waves is necessary to distinguish them
from similar peristaltic movements of the intestine.[16] The diminution
in size of the abdominal prominence caused by a dilated stomach after
profuse vomiting or after washing out the stomach may aid in the
diagnosis.[Footnote 16: Kussmaul says that vigorous peristaltic movements of the
stomach may be perceptible through the abdominal walls even when there
is no dilatation of the stomach.Under these circumstances he
attributes the peristaltic commotion to an independent neurosis of the
stomach ("Die Peristaltische Unruhe des Magens," _Volkmann's Samml.An important aid in bringing out the contours of the stomach is the
artificial distension of the organ by the generation within it of
carbonic acid gas, as first suggested by Frerichs.For this purpose
20-30 grains of bicarbonate of sodium and 15-20 grains of tartaric
acid, each dissolved in a little lukewarm water, may be given one after
the other.If the stomach be much dilated and relaxed, it may be
necessary to give much larger quantities of the powders (up to 2-2-1/2
drachms of the soda and a corresponding quantity of the acid).It is
well to have a stomach-tube at hand in order to withdraw the gas in
case unpleasant symptoms develop.Sometimes the stomach fails to become
distended by this procedure.This is due in some cases to the escape of
the gas through the pyloric orifice into the intestine--a condition
designated by Ebstein as incontinence of the pylorus.It may be that
sometimes the gas produces such firm {597} contraction of the gastric
walls that the stomach does not expand by the pressure of the gas.Instead of generating gas, a similar result may be produced by simply
injecting air into the stomach through a stomach-tube, as recommended
by Oser and by Runeberg.The air may, however, escape along the side of
the tube.Palpation of the distended stomach yields an elastic resistance which
has been compared to that of an air-cushion.By palpating carefully
from above downward the greater curvature can sometimes be appreciated,
but in general it is difficult to distinguish it from the transverse
colon.Peristaltic movements may perhaps be appreciated by palpation
when they are not evident on inspection.If a dilated stomach contains
considerable fluid and the abdominal walls are yielding, fluctuation
may be perceived by palpation.The lowest level at which this
fluctuation can be felt may afford a clue as to the position of the
lower border of the stomach, but not much dependence can be placed upon
this sense of fluctuation unless many sources of error in its
interpretation are excluded.By pressing gently and repeatedly against the abdominal walls a
splashing sound can usually be heard in cases of well-marked dilatation
of the stomach (bruit de clapotement).This sound can best be brought
out when the patient is in the recumbent position, with relaxed
abdominal walls, by palpating near the left border of the ribs.The
same sound can be produced by shaking the patient (bruit de glou-glou).This sound may be heard at a considerable distance from the patient, to
whom it may be a source of much annoyance.In itself this splashing
sound is without diagnostic significance, as the condition for its
production--namely, the simultaneous presence of gas and liquid in the
stomach--exists often in healthy persons.By paying attention, however,
to the time at which this sound can be produced after eating or
drinking, and to its greater or less constancy, some diagnostic
importance can be attached to this sign.If the splashing sound can be
usually produced two hours or longer after the ingestion of liquid or
six hours after an ordinary meal, it generally indicates that
dilatation of the stomach exists.[17] It is necessary to exclude
somewhat similar sounds which may be produced in the intestines,
particularly in the transverse colon and caecum.The series of gurgling
sounds which may sometimes be produced in the intestine by palpation
are not likely to be confounded with the single splashing sound
produced in the stomach, but under certain circumstances a splashing
sound may be produced in the transverse colon which cannot be
distinguished from the gastric sound.If a dilated stomach contains a
very large quantity of fluid, the splashing sound cannot readily be
produced.[Footnote 17: Baradat, _Etude sur le Bruit de Clapotement stomacal_,
These, Paris, 1884.Baradat says that this bruit is also diagnostic of
dilatation when it can be produced by palpating below a horizontal line
passing through the junction of the ninth and tenth ribs, but it is
evident that motion might be transmitted to the stomach even when its
greater curvature is above this line by palpating below the level of
the umbilicus.]Leube has pointed out that the end of the stomach-tube (of course the
hard tube), after it has been inserted into the stomach, can often be
felt through the abdominal walls.[18] He says that if the tube can be
felt below a horizontal line passing through the anterior superior
spinous processes of the ileum, dilatation of the stomach may be
positively diagnosed, {598} and the existence of dilatation is probable
if the tube can be felt much below the umbilicus.No force should be
used in trying to make the end of the tube palpable.Of course if the
abdominal walls are thick or very tense the tube cannot be felt.Leube's method is simple and convenient, and applicable to many cases.As will be explained hereafter, a position of the lower border of the
stomach even quite as low as Leube's rule demands cannot be considered
by itself positive evidence of dilatation.[19]

[Footnote 18: _Deutsches Arch.[Footnote 19: According to Oser, there is a possible source of error in
Leube's method--namely, that the sound may slide along the greater
curvature of the stomach, and even reach the pylorus, so that the end
may be felt higher than the lowest point of the stomach.Considerable
objection has been made to Leube's method on the ground of its danger,
but this objection is based on the assumption that greater energy is
employed in pressing forward the sound than Leube recommends (Oser,
article "Magenerweiterung" in _Eulenburg's Real Encyclopadie_, Bd.The length to which the stomach-tube can be inserted before meeting
resistance may evidently give some idea as to the size of the stomach.The attempt, however, to establish any general law with reference to
this point has not proven successful.In many cases valuable information as to the size of the stomach is
afforded by percussion.Over the greater part of the stomach the
percussion note is tympanitic, sometimes with a metallic quality.Over
the most dependent part of the stomach a dull sound is produced on
percussion in case a sufficient quantity of fluid or solid material is
contained in the viscus.In the upright position, therefore, in
percussing over the stomach from above downward, the tympanitic note
gives place to a dull sound, and this zone of dulness will change with
the position of the patient, so that in the recumbent posture the
dulness may entirely disappear.In order to prove that the region of
dulness belongs to the stomach, Piorry caused the patient to drink a
large quantity of water (a pint to a quart).In a healthy empty stomach
this quantity of water suffices to produce a zone of dulness which does
not descend below the level of the umbilicus.If, however, the dulness
be produced below the level of the umbilicus, it is inferred that
dilatation exists.Penzoldt's modification of Piorry's method gives
more certain results.[20] By withdrawing the fluid from the stomach by
the stomach-tube the dulness may be made to disappear, and by injecting
more fluid the dulness may be made to reappear at will.By noting the
lower limit of the dulness thus produced the position of the lower
border of the stomach may be determined.The farther this lies below
the umbilicus the greater, presumptively, is the degree of dilatation.The artificial distension of the stomach with gas may also aid in
determining its limits by percussion.It must be said that in general
the separation of the lower limits of the stomach from the transverse
colon by means of percussion is a matter of great difficulty, and
sometimes is impossible.[Footnote 20: Penzoldt, _op.Upon auscultation over a dilated stomach sometimes a fine crackling or
sizzling sound, like that audible upon first uncorking a bottle of
soda-water, can be heard.[21] This is referable to the fermentation
which is in progress in the stomach.Eichhorst says that a similar but
finer crackling sound can be heard over a stomach in which carbonic
acid gas is {599} being artificially generated, and that this sound
abruptly ceases when the ear passes below the limits of the greater
curvature.[22]

[Footnote 21: Pauli was the first to record this phenomenon (_De
Ventriculi Dilatatione_, Frankfurt, 1839).]The displacement of neighboring organs by a dilated stomach does not
generally give rise to important physical signs.As the tendency of a
dilated stomach is to sink down in the abdomen, there is not usually
much displacement of the thoracic viscera.If, however, the fundus of
the stomach be distended with gas, the heart may be pushed upward, and,
being pressed against the chest-wall, its apex-beat may be more
forcible and diffused than normal.The tympanitic stomach may impart a
metallic quality to the cardiac sounds.MORBID ANATOMY.--Considerable degrees of dilatation of the stomach are
easily recognized by post-mortem examination.In extreme cases the
stomach occupies all of the anterior region of the abdomen, covering
over the intestines and extending down to the pubes or even into the
true pelvis.Many cases are recorded in which the stomach was capable
of holding six to twelve pints.Godon[23] describes under the name
ventriculi hydrops a hardly credible case in which it is said that the
stomach contained ninety pounds of fluid!In the ordinary cases of
gastrectasia the lower border of the stomach is found somewhere between
the umbilicus and the pubes, frequently about a hand's breadth below
the level of the umbilicus.de Hydrops Ventriculi_, London, 1646.This
celebrated case is described with much detail.For three years the
abdomen was enormously distended, but the patient, a woman, never
vomited.The affection was supposed to be dropsy of the peritoneum.Death occurred in a condition of extreme marasmus.The pylorus was the
seat of a hydatid cyst which extended into the duodenum.The stomach,
which was enormously distended, contained ninety pounds of fluid, in
which floated a great number of hydatid cysts, some of which were
ruptured.The anterior wall of the stomach was adherent to the parietal
peritoneum.The two orifices of the stomach were drawn close to each
other.The length of the stomach equalled a Paris ell.]The fundus, being the most dilatable part of the stomach, is in most
cases disproportionately dilated in comparison with the pyloric region.This excessive dilatation of the fundus is most noticeable in
gastrectasia due to stenosis.In most cases of dilatation the pylorus
sinks down somewhat in the abdomen, but in consequence of the
distension of the lower segment of the stomach the long axis of the
organ is more nearly transverse than normal.If the pylorus be fixed,
the lesser curvature may be drawn down in its middle so as to acquire a
hooked shape.The lesser curvature, which should be covered by the
liver, may be found considerably below its normal level.The dilated
fundus may extend from the left hypochondrium into the left iliac
region.[24]

[Footnote 24: Fogt reports a case in which an enormously dilated
stomach occupied a scrotal hernia of the left side.He refers to two
other similar cases (_Aerztl.Intelligenzbl._, 1884, No.More or less dilatation of the oesophagus is associated with marked
dilatation of the stomach.If dilatation of the stomach be due to
obstruction in the upper part of the intestine, then the pyloric
orifice and the intestine on the proximal side of the obstruction will
be found dilated.The walls of a dilated stomach may be hypertrophied, and such cases are
called hypertrophic dilatation; or the walls may be of normal thickness
or may be thinned, and these cases are called atrophic or atonic
dilatation.In general, the thickness of the gastric walls in
gastrectasia {600} depends upon that of the muscular coat.As a rule,
in cases of pyloric stenosis the muscular coat of the stomach is
hypertrophied.This hypertrophy affects chiefly the muscle of the
pyloric region.The gastric walls in stenotic dilatation may, however,
be of normal thickness or even atrophied.In non-stenotic dilatation
the muscular coat may be either hypertrophied or atrophied, but it
rarely attains the thickness observed in cases of gastrectasia due to
obstruction.Maier and others have repeatedly observed fatty and
colloid degeneration of the muscular fibres of dilated stomachs.[25]
More frequently, however, no degenerative change has been found in the
muscle.[Footnote 25: _Deutsches Archiv f. klin.cit._ Maier designates as colloid degeneration a
peculiar homogeneous, glistening appearance of the muscular fibres.This change is not such as would usually be called colloid, but this
term is loosely used to designate a great variety of pathological
changes.The form of muscular hypertrophy in gastrectasia is chiefly
the numerical.]The mucous membrane in dilatation of the stomach is usually in the
condition of chronic catarrhal gastritis.Although there are various
statements as to atrophy of the gastric tubules and degeneration of the
epithelial cells in the tubes in cases of gastric dilatation,
satisfactory histological investigations of the mucous membrane of the
stomach in this disease are wanting.[26]

[Footnote 26: For satisfactory studies of this nature it is desirable
that alcohol or some preservative fluid should be injected into the
stomach immediately after death.]Atrophy of various abdominal viscera--particularly of the spleen, which
is usually small in this disease--has been attributed to the pressure
of a dilated stomach.This atrophy, however, is probably in many cases
only a part of the general emaciation and anaemia.While well-marked cases of dilatation of the stomach cannot be mistaken
on post-mortem examination, it is important to add that the
pathological anatomist cannot always decide whether or not dilatation
of the stomach exists in the clinical sense.The following
considerations will make this evident: In the first place, the stomach
is a very variable organ as regards its size, so that it is impossible
to set definite limits, and say that a stomach exceeding these is
necessarily dilated, while a stomach not exceeding these limits is
normal.In the second place, it belongs to the clinical definition of
dilatation of the stomach that the organ is insufficient for the
performance of its normal functions.This insufficiency cannot be
determined at the post-mortem table.To determine, therefore, whether
stomachs which fall within certain not easily definable limits of size
are pathologically dilated or not, it is necessary to correct and
complete the results of the post-mortem examination by a knowledge of
the clinical history.[27]

[Footnote 27: To deny all value to post-mortem examination in the
determination of dilatation of the stomach, as has been done, is
absurd.In the majority of cases this examination affords satisfactory
evidence, but for some cases a reservation like that in the text must
be made.Rosenbach in an able article shows the error of regarding
dilatation of the stomach too exclusively from the anatomical point of
view ("Der Mechanismus und die Diagnose der Mageninsufficienz,"
_Volkmann's Samml.DIAGNOSIS.--A considerable degree of dilatation of the stomach can
generally be diagnosticated without difficulty by means of the symptoms
and physical signs which have been described.The most important
diagnostic features relate to the character of the vomiting and to the
physical signs, together with the information afforded by the use of
the {601} stomach-tube.The diagnostic characters of the vomiting are
the large quantity rejected, its occurrence several hours after a meal,
its periodicity with long intervals, the temporary relief afforded, the
presence of undigested food taken a considerable time previously, and
the existence of fermentation.Washing out the stomach will also afford
evidence of stagnation of food.The time generally occupied in the
digestion of an ordinary meal is not over six to seven hours, so that
in health the contents of the stomach removed by the stomach-tube at
the end of this time should usually be free from undigested food.There
are of course individual idiosyncrasies with reference to the time
occupied in digestion, so that implicit reliance cannot be placed on
this diagnostic test.Delayed digestion is in itself no evidence of the
existence of dilatation, but the establishment of the presence of this
symptom may confirm other points in the diagnosis.Simple inspection, palpation, and percussion of the abdomen are
sometimes, although rarely, sufficient for the diagnosis of dilatation
of the stomach.Various devices have already been described which aid
in the physical examination of the stomach, such as the administration
of effervescing powders, the introduction of the stomach-tube, and
Piorry's and Penzoldt's methods of determining the lower border of the
stomach.[28] It {602} is not necessary to repeat here the diagnostic
evidence afforded by physical examination.Excellent service as these
devices often perform, it must be confessed that they do not always
answer the purpose intended.The artificial distension of the stomach
with gas does not enable us always to distinguish intestine from
stomach.If the abdominal walls are thick or very rigid, this method,
like most of the others, is of little or no assistance.Then, as
already mentioned, the administration of the powders may fail to
produce any distension of the stomach, and may possibly mislead by
causing distension of intestine.Moreover, the artificial tympanites
may cause the patient much discomfort.The method of determining the
lower border of the stomach by Piorry's or Penzoldt's method is not
always conclusive.If the stomach be much dilated, it may take a very
large quantity of water to produce an appreciable zone of dulness.If
the transverse colon be distended with feces, it will not be easy to
separate the dulness of the stomach from that of the colon.Moreover,
loops of intestine containing feces or gas may lie over the anterior
surface of the stomach.The use of the stomach-tube simply for
diagnostic purposes is, for various reasons, not always practicable.With due recognition of the important additions during the last few
years to our means of exploring the stomach, it must be admitted that
we are still far from any positive and universally applicable method of
determining the size and position of this organ during life.This
admission is the more necessary in view of the extravagant claims which
have been made for various more or less complicated contrivances for
physical exploration of the stomach.[Footnote 28: Several other methods have been suggested for determining
the size and position of the stomach, but they have not found general
acceptance.Thus, Schreiber attaches a soft rubber balloon to the end
of a stomach-tube, and after its insertion in the stomach inflates it
(_Deutsches Arch.In Neubauer's method the long
end of a syphon-tube communicating with the stomach is bent upward, and
a glass tube is placed in the bent portion.The fluid will evidently
stand at the same level in the tube as in the stomach in case the
atmospheric pressure in both is the same.The atmospheric pressure in
the stomach is produced by using a double tube or by passing a second
tube into the stomach (_Prager med.Wochenschr._, 1879).Purjesz
attached a manometer to a stomach-tube, and thought that he could fix
the position of the cardia by noting the moment when in the passage
downward of the tube the negative pressure changed to positive, but
Schreiber has shown that the manometer may indicate negative pressure
even after the tube has entered the stomach (_Deutsches Arch.It has been asserted that by means of
auscultatory percussion of a stomach artificially distended with gas
the boundaries of the organ can be determined.Leichtenstern considers
the metallic quality of the tone heard over the stomach under these
circumstances more or less characteristic, while Skamper compares the
characteristic tone to that produced by tapping with the finger on the
dorsal surface of the hand of which the valar surface is placed against
the external ear (_Inaug.Diss._, Berlin, 1879, p.It has been
claimed that the sound as of water dropping into a large cavity, which
can be heard when the patient is drinking, can no longer be heard when
the auscultating ear passes beyond the greater curvature (V.
Bamberger).Wunderlich suggests the possibility of feeling the arteries
of the greater curvature through the abdominal walls.Ferber calls
attention in cases of gastrectasia to a strip of dulness, with absent
vocal and respiratory sounds, corresponding to the posterior inferior
border of the left lung.This dulness, which is produced by material in
the most dependent part of the dilated stomach, disappears when the
patient assumes the knee-elbow position (_Deutsche Zeitschr.When it is impossible by other methods to
distinguish the lower portion of the stomach from the transverse colon,
it has been proposed to distend the colon with water, with gas, or with
air injected through a tube passed into the rectum.cit._) found that the length of a tube (hard) or bougie reaching the
bottom of the stomach, estimating from the upper incisor teeth, should
be in a normal stomach at least 5 cm.less than that of the vertebral
column (occiput to coccyx), and at the most not much more than
one-third of the length of the body (1:2.8-1:3.3).In three cases of
gastrectasia he found the length of the tube inserted into the stomach
considerably more than one-third of the length of the body (1:2.4); in
one of the cases this length even exceeded that of the vertebral
column, and in the others it nearly equalled the length of the
vertebral column.Rosenbach's method of determining the elastic and
contractile power of the stomach is ingenious, but hardly of practical
utility.By injecting air into the stomach through a bulb apparatus
attached to the end of a stomach-tube, he is able to tell when the
point of the tube passes beneath the surface of fluid in the stomach by
hearing on auscultation a characteristic moist bubbling sound.Elevation or depression of the level of the fluid can be determined by
withdrawing or by pushing forward the tube.That quantity of fluid
which, introduced into an empty stomach, causes no elevation, or
perhaps causes a depression, of the level of the food in the stomach,
indicates the utmost limit of the elastic and contractile forces of the
stomach (Rosenbach, _Volkmann's Samml.The determination of the position of the lower border of the stomach
does not in itself enable us to infer positively the size of the organ.It may be taken as a general rule that if the lower border of the
stomach be found persistently below the level of the umbilicus, the
stomach is dilated; but there are many exceptions to this rule.Sometimes an otherwise normal stomach preserves in adult life the
vertical position which it had in the foetus, so that its lowest point
may be below the umbilicus.According to Kussmaul, a vertical position
of the stomach is a predisposing cause of dilatation.Occasionally a
stomach has a looped shape, so that without any dilatation of the organ
the lowest point may fall below the level of the umbilicus.It is,
moreover, a clinical fact established by the experience of many
observers that the lower border of the stomach may be found below the
level of the umbilicus without the existence of any symptoms of
dilatation.The uncertainty of the anatomical diagnosis of dilatation of the
stomach in some cases makes it all the more necessary, as has been
repeatedly urged in the course of this article, to make a careful study
of the evidences of disordered gastric functions.The symptoms of most
importance in determining whether the condition called insufficiency of
the stomach is present or not are fermentation of the gastric contents
and the {603} persistent presence of undigested food in the stomach
beyond the limits of normal digestion.It is true that these symptoms
may be present without any dilatation of the stomach, but they are
likely to lead to dilatation if unchecked, and, what is of practical
importance, they require essentially the same treatment as dilatation.A differential diagnosis between chronic catarrhal gastritis and atonic
dyspepsia on the one hand, and the early stages of dilatation of the
stomach on the other, cannot be made with any positiveness.Of course, with our present means of diagnosis the confounding of
dilated stomachs with ascites, ovarian cysts, pregnancy, hydatid cysts
(of each of these errors there are recorded instances), is inexcusable.PROGNOSIS AND COURSE.--The prognosis of dilatation of the stomach
depends first of all upon the nature of the primary disease causing the
dilatation.The prognosis of cancerous dilatation is as unfavorable as
possible.In dilatation due to non-cancerous stenosis the prognosis is
in general more favorable.Life may be prolonged sometimes for many
years, and the patient's condition greatly benefited by proper
treatment.A permanent cure of stenotic dilatation is not impossible,
but it is rarely to be expected.Even if temporarily relieved, the
symptoms of dilatation are likely sooner or later to return and to lead
to a fatal termination.The progress of the disease depends upon the
degree and the stationary or advancing character of the stenosis.In
the article on GASTRIC ULCER mention has been made of the cure of a few
cases of desperate gastric dilatation due to cicatricial pyloric
stenosis by means of resection of the diseased pylorus.In general, the prognosis is more favorable in dilatation without
stenosis.If the degree of dilatation be only moderate, a permanent
cure may often be effected by proper treatment.If, however, the
dilatation be considerable, while the symptoms may be relieved or even
made to disappear for a time, relapses are prone to occur, and a
permanent cure is rarely obtained.Undoubtedly, Kussmaul's publication
in 1869, in giving to us a most valuable method of treatment, at the
same time raised extravagant expectations of the frequency with which
dilatation of the stomach can be cured.Too often the treatment with
the stomach-tube proves only palliative and not curative.The course of dilatation of the stomach is chronic.The mode of death
is usually by inanition, very rarely from rupture of the stomach.TREATMENT.--Reference to the causation of dilatation of the stomach
will show that there is considerable scope for the prophylactic
treatment of dilatation not referable to stenosis or incurable organic
disease.Thus, the correction of the habits of eating or drinking
inordinate quantities, or of imperfectly masticating the food in
consequence of haste or bad teeth or vicious custom, may avert the
development of gastric dilatation.Of especial importance is the timely
treatment of cases of dyspepsia or of chronic catarrhal gastritis which
are accompanied with fermentation or delayed digestion--conditions in
which the stomach-tube is of great service.Of the means at our disposal for meeting the causal and the symptomatic
indications of dilatation of the stomach, the most important by far is
the use of the stomach-tube for the purpose of emptying and of washing
out the stomach.The introduction of this procedure by Kussmaul in 1867
marked a new era in the treatment of gastric disorders.{604} By washing out the stomach we accomplish three important things:
first, we remove the weight which helps to distend the organ; secondly,
we remove mucus and stagnating and fermenting material which irritates
and often inflames the stomach and impedes digestion; and, thirdly, we
cleanse the inner surface of the stomach and obtain the beneficial
influence of the direct application of water, to which various
medicinal substances can be added.It is probable that in removing the
fermenting contents of the stomach we also remove a possible source of
self-infection of the system (see page 596).By accomplishing these things we may possibly also enable the stomach
to regain its lost elasticity and muscular contractility.But unless
the normal elastic and contractile powers of the stomach are restored,
the treatment with the stomach-tube, indispensable as it is for the
relief of symptoms, is only palliative and not curative.Whether or not
this restoration of the stomach to its normal functional activity is to
be expected depends chiefly upon the cause and the degree of the
dilatation.Unfortunately, as has already been stated under Prognosis,
the permanent cure of dilatation of the stomach due to organic
stenosis, although possible, is not to be expected, and the number of
cases in which largely dilated stomachs can be restored to their normal
volume or made to perform permanently their normal functions is small.There remains, however, a considerable number of curable cases--to be
sure, not always easily diagnosticated--in which the muscular coat of
the stomach has not been seriously damaged and in which the dilatation
is generally only moderate.Furthermore, excellent results are obtained
by the use of the stomach-tube in the cases which have been designated
insufficiency of the stomach, and which are closely allied to
dilatation--in fact, often represent its early stage.As has already
been mentioned, the most important criteria of this so-called
insufficiency are the fermentation of the contents of the stomach and
the presence therein of undigested food after the period required for
normal digestion (six to seven hours for an ordinary meal).There are two principal methods of washing out the stomach--one by the
stomach-pump, the other by the siphon process.The stomach-pump is the
older method, and still has its advocates.The pump used by Kussmaul is
the Wyman pump, described by Bowditch in the _American Journal of
Medical Sciences_, vol.This (which is also called
the Weiss pump), as well as other forms of stomach-pump, consists in
principle simply of an aspirating syringe having at its anterior
extremity two openings communicating with the barrel of the syringe.These openings can be alternately opened and closed by means of an
arrangement of valves.Through one opening, which is made to
communicate with an incompressible tube inserted into the stomach (the
other opening being now closed), the gastric contents are drawn into
the barrel of the syringe.This opening is now closed, and through the
other opening the contents of the syringe are discharged through a tube
externally.In a similar way fluid can be drawn into the syringe and
pumped into the stomach.In the siphon process the outer end of the tube inserted into the
stomach is connected with a piece of elastic tubing about three and a
half feet long, in the free end of which is inserted the extremity of a
medium-sized glass funnel.A single elastic tube about six feet long
may also be used.{605} When the funnel is elevated, water which has
been poured into it will run into the stomach.If now, before the water
has all run out, the funnel be depressed below the level of the
stomach, the fluid contents of the stomach will flow out through the
tube according to the principle of the siphon.20 and 21 will
make clear the mode of operation of this process.(The tube shown in
these figures is the Faucher tube, commonly used in France, and
consisting, with the funnel, of one piece.A longer tube than that
shown in the figure should be used.)[29]]

[Illustration: FIG.[29]]

[Footnote 29: From Souligoux, _De la Dilatation de l'Estomac_, Paris,
1883.]Another convenient but somewhat more complicated method of employing
the siphon process is according to Rosenthal's principle, and is
represented in Fig.To the outer end of the stomach-tube is
attached a Y-shaped glass tube, one arm of which is connected with an
elastic tube running to an irrigator, while the other arm is connected
with the discharging tube.Through the irrigating tube water runs into
the stomach, the discharging tube being compressed.If the discharging
tube be opened while the fluid is flowing from the irrigator, and if
then, after the establishment of a column of water in the discharging
tube, the irrigating tube be compressed or the stopcock of the
irrigator be closed, a siphon communicating with the stomach is formed
and empties this organ of its fluid contents.[30]]

[Footnote 30: From Leube, in _Ziemssen's Handb.u.
Therap._, Bd.In the siphon process the tube inserted into the stomach may be an
incompressible hard-rubber tube like that employed with the
stomach-pump, but by far the simplest, most convenient, and safest form
of stomach-tube is the soft, flexible, red rubber tube, resembling the
Jacques catheter, but of course larger and longer.[31] This soft tube
can inflict no {606} injury, and in most cases it is readily
introduced.Generally, the patient himself can best manipulate the
introduction of the tube.After the tube is introduced into the
pharynx, the patient, who should be in a sitting posture, makes
repeated acts of swallowing, by means of which, accompanied by
directing and gently pushing the tube with the fingers, the tube passes
along the oesophagus into the stomach.Often at first the nervousness
and inexperience of the patient occasion some trouble, but after a
little practice he generally succeeds in introducing the tube without
discomfort or difficulty.Before its introduction the tube should be
anointed with a little vaseline or some similar substance.In an adult
the tube is introduced for a length of at least 20 to 25 inches, and in
cases of dilatation of the stomach of course for a greater distance.Whatever form of stomach-tube be used, it is important that the tube
should be at least 30 inches long, and should be provided with one, and
preferably with two, large eyes at its distal extremity.[Footnote 31: Such a tube (marked 19 A) is made by Tieman & Co.of New
York, and is to be had of most surgical instrument-makers.(For a
fuller description of the tube and the mode of its employment see
article by W. B. Platt, "The Mechanical Treatment of Diseases of the
Stomach," _Maryland Medical Journal_, March 8, 1884.)Oser's tube is 2 meters long, and is made of mineralized rubber.The smaller has a lumen of 8 mm.The thickness of the
wall is 2-1/2 mm.In the larger tube the lumen is 10 mm., and the
thickness of the wall 3 mm.Faucher's tube is 1-1/2 meters long.The external diameter of the tube
is 10 to 12 mm.The walls are of such thickness that the tube can be
bent without effacing its lumen.At one extremity is a lateral eye with
two orifices.To the other extremity is adapted a funnel with a
capacity of about 500 grammes.]Although the stomach-pump has the advantage of more completely
evacuating the stomach and of removing coarser solid particles than is
possible with the siphon, nevertheless its disadvantages--namely, the
possibility of inflicting injury to the mucous membrane of the
stomach,[32] the expense and greater complexity of the instrument, and
the circumstance that it should be used only by the physician--in
contrast with the advantages of the siphon--namely, its cheapness,
simplicity, safety, and possible employment by the patient or his
attendants--have led to the general adoption of the latter process.Only the soft-rubber stomach-tube should be left to the employment of
the patient.[Footnote 32: A number of cases have been recorded in which pieces of
the mucous membrane of the stomach have been detached by the
stomach-pump.Although as yet no serious effects have followed this
accident, the possibility of its occurrence can certainly not be
regarded with equanimity.]Sometimes the flow through the siphon is interrupted by occlusion of
the eye of the stomach-tube by a solid mass or by some cause not always
clear.As already mentioned, it is desirable that there should be two
openings at the gastric extremity of the tube.When the flow is {607}
interrupted the position of the tube in the stomach may be changed, or
the patient may be directed to cough or to exert the pressure of the
abdominal muscles, or more water may be allowed to run into the stomach
in order to displace an occluding mass in the tube.It is, however,
well for such cases to have, if possible, a stomach-pump and an
incompressible tube in reserve.Moreover, as is apparent from the
foregoing statement of the advantages of the stomach-pump, there are
cases in which this instrument is much more useful than the siphon, so
that one cannot decide unconditionally in favor of one instrument over
the other.The stomach-tube should be secured so that there can be no possibility
of its being swallowed entirely.A string may be attached to the distal
end of the tube.Leube[33] has reported an instance in which the whole
tube disappeared into the stomach, and Jackson[34] has also narrated a
case in which an insane patient swallowed the stomach-tube.In both
cases the tube was subsequently rejected by vomiting.[Footnote 33: _Deutsches Arch.[Footnote 34: _Extracts from the Records of the Boston Society for
Medical Improvement_, vol.For washing out the stomach after the greater part of the contents have
been withdrawn, about a pint of tepid fluid is allowed to slowly run
into the stomach, and is then siphoned out.This process is to be
repeated several times.In general, tepid water suffices for washing
out the stomach, but it is often better to use, at least a part of the
time, a 1 to 2 per cent.solution of bicarbonate of sodium, which
facilitates the removal of mucus.The artificial and the natural Vichy
and Carlsbad waters are also excellent for this purpose.Various
additions are also made to the water with the view of counteracting
fermentative changes in the stomach.For this purpose perhaps the best
agents are salicylate of sodium (1 per cent.solution) or resorcin (2
per cent.Other substances which have also been recommended
are carbolic acid, permanganate of potassium, hyposulphite of sodium,
creasote, benzine.Simple water, however, accomplishes about all that
is possible, and many are satisfied to use it without any medication.As regards the frequency with which the stomach is to be washed out,
one is to be guided by the symptoms and the effect obtained by the use
of the stomach-tube.As a general rule, it suffices to wash out the
stomach once a day, and often the process need be repeated only every
second or third day.Opinions are divided as to the best time of day to select for washing
out the stomach.Kussmaul recommends the morning before breakfast, and
the majority have followed his advice; others prefer the evening.There
is much, however, in favor of washing out the stomach about half an
hour before the principal meal of the day.The best opportunity has
been offered for the digestion and absorption of the food taken at the
previous main meal, and the stomach is placed in the best possible
condition for the reception of more food.The habitual washing out of the stomach is not without its drawbacks.We often remove, as has been pointed out especially by Leube, not only
noxious substances from the stomach, but also the completed products of
digestion.To withdraw from the nourishment of the body this chyme
which the stomach has laboriously manufactured cannot be a matter of
indifference.Still, with the weakened absorptive powers of the
stomach, {608} and its inability to properly propel its contents into
the intestine, it is a question how much of this chyme would eventually
be utilized for nutrition.The
relief which the patient experiences when his overloaded stomach is
freed of its burden, and the knowledge that this method of relief is
always at hand, may make him careless in the observance of the dietetic
rules which are of great importance in the treatment of this disease.It is well, therefore, not to wash out the stomach oftener than is
necessary, nor to continue the habitual use of the stomach-tube longer
than is required.There are contraindications to the use of the stomach-tube.In very
rare instances the attempt to introduce the tube causes the patient so
much distress, produces such violent spasm of the pharyngeal and
adjacent muscles, or induces so much retching and vomiting, or is
attended with such prostration or even syncope, that this method of
treatment has to be abandoned.Great weakness, recent gastric
hemorrhage, ulcer of the stomach in most cases (see page 523), often
cancer of the cardia or of the oesophagus, and aneurism of the aorta,
are contraindications to the use of the stomach-tube.If we group together the results obtained by the use of the
stomach-tube in gastric dilatation, we shall find cases in which no
benefit results; cases which are benefited, but are obliged to continue
the use of the stomach-tube throughout life; cases in which recovery is
slow and gradual; cases with more or less speedy relief or apparent
cure, but followed by relapses; and cases of prompt relief and
permanent cure.The regulation of the diet is never to be neglected in cases of
dilatation of the stomach.Here the guiding principles are that little
fluid should be taken, and that the food should be small in bulk,
nutritious, easily digestible, and not readily undergoing fermentation.The patient should drink as little water as possible, and should
therefore avoid whatever occasions thirst.It is hardly practicable to
carry out the plan of giving water mostly by the rectum, as has been
proposed.In most cases milk is useful, but an exclusively milk diet is
not generally well borne on account of the quantity of fluid required.Leube's beef-solution is often serviceable.Soft-boiled eggs and tender
meats are to be allowed, particularly the white meat of fowl and rare
beefsteak, especially that prepared from scraped and finely-chopped
beef, as recommended in the treatment of gastric ulcer (page 521).Fatty, saccharine, and amylaceous articles of food--hence most
vegetables and fruits--are to be avoided on account of their tendency
to undergo fermentation in the stomach.Alcohol in any form is usually
detrimental.If gastric symptoms, particularly vomiting, be very
urgent, or if food introduced into the stomach affords little or no
nourishment, as in some cases of tight pyloric stricture, then rectal
alimentation is to be resorted to.An important indication is to restore the tone and contractile power of
the muscular coat of the stomach.For this purpose electricity, in the
form both of the constant and of the faradic current, has been
beneficially employed.The best results are reported from the use of
the faradic current.Both poles may be applied over the region of the
stomach.The application of electricity to the inside of the stomach by
means of electrodes attached to stomach-tubes or bougies is a more
{609} difficult procedure, but has its advocates.Uniformly good
results are not obtained by the use of electricity in gastric
dilatation, but there can be no doubt that in some cases decided
benefit follows this method of treatment.Nux vomica, particularly its alkaloid strychnia, has been much employed
with the view of stimulating the muscular power of the stomach.Strychnia is given either internally or hypodermically.Hypodermic
injections of ergotin have also been used for the same purpose.It has
been hoped to increase the contraction of the stomach by cold
applications to the abdomen, as by ice-bags applied immediately after
washing out the stomach.The benefit derived from these various
attempts to increase the tonicity of the gastric muscle is not very
apparent.A belt or bandage around the abdomen in order to support the stomach
sometimes makes the patient feel more comfortable; in other cases it
aggravates the symptoms.In many cases digestion is promoted by giving dilute hydrochloric acid
with or without pepsin.About ten drops of dilute hydrochloric acid may
be given half an hour to an hour after each meal.When the stomach is systematically washed out, the individual symptoms
of dilatation of the stomach will rarely require special treatment.The
sensation of fulness and weight in the stomach, the eructations, the
vomiting, and the constipation are generally relieved, at least
temporarily, by washing out the stomach.The appetite is improved, and
an increase in weight is usually soon noticeable.If heartburn and eructations of gas continue troublesome, an antacid,
such as bicarbonate of sodium or prepared chalk, will be found useful.Leube, in order to relieve constipation and to increase the peristalsis
of the stomach, administers Carlsbad water (see page 522).Not more
than five or six ounces of the water need be given, and this should be
taken slowly in divided doses.A laxative pill containing rhubarb may
be given occasionally.If anaemia be the cause or a prominent accompaniment of dilatation of
the stomach, iron may be administered in a form as little disturbing
the digestion as possible, as the effervescing citrate or the lactate,
or arsenic in the form of Fowler's solution may be tried.In general,
however, all drugs which impair the appetite or digestion are to be
withheld.The digestion and the general condition of the patient are
often benefited by massage.Resection of the pylorus in cases of cancerous and of cicatricial
stenosis of this orifice has been performed in several instances.The
subject, as regards its medical in distinction from its surgical
bearings, has already been discussed in connection with cancer of the
stomach (see page 577).Here it may be added that the propriety of
resection is less open for dispute in cases of non-cancerous pyloric
stenosis than it is in cancer of the pylorus.Remarkable results have been reported by Loreta in cases of cicatricial
stenosis of the pylorus.After performing gastrotomy he inserts his
fingers through the constricted pyloric orifice and forcibly dilates
the stricture.[35] To judge from experience in divulsing strictures in
other parts of {610} the body, it does not seem probable that a
permanent cure can be often effected by this bold and dangerous
procedure.[Footnote 35: Loreta has performed this operation successfully no less
than nine times (_The Lancet_, April 26, 1884).]Acute Dilatation of the Stomach.Under the name acute dilatation of the stomach[36] have been described
cases in which it has been supposed that a more or less suddenly
developed paralysis of the muscular coat of the stomach exists.But the
propriety of the term acute dilatation, and the very existence of an
acute paralysis of the stomach, are, to say the least, questionable.[Footnote 36: The literature pertaining to the subject of acute
dilatation of the stomach is to be found in Poensgen, _Die Motorischen
Verrichtungen des Menschlichen Magens_, Strasburg, 1882, p.As causes of this so-called acute dilatation of the stomach have been
assigned injuries, particularly those affecting the abdomen, surgical
operations involving the peritoneum, acute inflammations of the mucous
and of the peritoneal coats of the stomach, acute fevers, especially
during convalescence, and overloading the stomach with food or with
liquids.The symptoms which have been chiefly emphasized are severe abdominal
pain, tympanitic distension of the stomach, and absence or cessation of
vomiting if this has previously existed.It will be noted that
inability to vomit under these circumstances implies not only paralysis
of the stomach, but also that of the abdominal muscles.The prognosis depends on the character of the primary disease causing
the alleged paralysis.If there be acute distension of the stomach with inability of the organ
to expel its contents either externally or into the intestine, the
stomach-tube may be employed to evacuate the gas and other material
present.In a case described by Hilton Fagge[37] as acute dilatation of the
stomach the symptoms of dilatation appeared suddenly and ran an acute
course, but the autopsy showed that the dilatation was doubtless of
much longer development than the symptoms indicated.In a case reported
by Nauwerk[38] of extreme dilatation in consequence of hypertrophic
stenosis of the pylorus, after ten months of insignificant dyspeptic
symptoms there suddenly appeared, after excess in eating, symptoms of
dilatation of great severity, which continued until a fatal termination
at the end of three months.Thus it appears that chronic dilatation of
the stomach may cause little disturbance for a considerable time and
then run a rapid course.[Footnote 37: "On Acute Dilatation of the Stomach," _Guy's Hosp.[Footnote 38: _Deutsches Arch.{611}

MINOR ORGANIC AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH.(CIRRHOSIS; HYPERTROPHIC STENOSIS OF PYLORUS; ATROPHY; ANOMALIES IN THE
FORM AND THE POSITION OF THE STOMACH; RUPTURE; GASTROMALACIA.)BY W. H. WELCH, M.D.CIRRHOSIS OF THE STOMACH.DEFINITION.--Cirrhosis of the stomach is characterized by thickening of
the walls of the greater part or of the whole of the stomach in
consequence of a new growth of fibrous tissue, combined usually with
hypertrophy of the muscular layers of the stomach.The cavity of the
stomach is usually contracted, but sometimes it is of normal size or
even dilated.SYNONYMS.--Fibroid induration of the stomach; Hypertrophy of the walls
of the stomach; Chronic interstitial gastritis; Sclerosis of the
stomach; Plastic linitis.HISTORY.--The writings of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
contain many records of extremely contracted stomachs with uniformly
and greatly thickened walls (Butzen, Loseke, Storck, Portal, Lieutaud,
Pohl, etc.).In the works of Lieutaud and of Voigtel may be found
references to many such cases.[1] Doubtless, some of these cases were
examples of cirrhosis of the stomach, but in the absence of
microscopical examination it is not possible to separate these from
cancer.[Footnote 1: Lieutaud, _Historia anat.-med._, t. i. p.8, Venet., 1779;
Voigtel, _Handb.Here it
may be mentioned that Diemerbroeck's case, which is so often quoted to
prove that polyphagia instead of causing gastric dilatation may produce
hypertrophy of the muscular coat of the stomach, with contraction, was
probably an instance of cirrhosis of the stomach.]Andral[2] was the first to describe fully and systematically
hypertrophy of the walls of the stomach.He attributed the lesion to
chronic inflammation.He erroneously supposed that scirrhus of the
stomach was only hypertrophy of the gastric walls.Cruveilhier[3]
distinguished between scirrhous induration and hypertrophy, which he
considered to be a final result of the irritation accompanying chronic
diseases of the stomach.Rokitansky's[4] description of fibroid
induration of the stomach, although brief, is accurate.He says that
the process usually involves the whole {612} stomach, and that it
originates in an inflammation of the submucous connective tissue.This
inflammation may occur either independently or in combination with
gastritis mucosa.Rokitansky emphasizes the error of confounding the
disease with scirrhous cancer.Bruch[5] made an elaborate study of
hypertrophy of the walls of the stomach, which he considered to be the
final stage of various chronic diseases of the stomach.Fibrous or
scirrhous cancer he considered to be nothing but this hypertrophy.[Footnote 2: _Precis d'Anat.[Footnote 3: _Anatomie pathologique_, Paris, 1830-42.]Anat._, Wien, 1855-61.]The best descriptions of cirrhosis of the stomach have been furnished
by English writers, by most of whom it is properly regarded as an
independent disease.Brinton[6] first employed the names cirrhosis of
the stomach and plastic linitis.Excellent descriptions of the disease
have been given by Hodgkin, Budd, Brinton, Habershon, H. Jones, Wilks,
Quain, and Smith.[Footnote 6: _Diseases of the Stomach_.]While in former times cirrhosis of the stomach was confounded with
cancer, in recent times it has not been separated by many from chronic
catarrhal gastritis.In German systematic works the disease receives,
as a rule, only passing mention in connection with chronic catarrhal
gastritis.ETIOLOGY.--Cirrhosis of the stomach is rare, but it is not so
exceptional as to be without any clinical importance.I have met with
three cases at post-mortem examination.The disease is more frequent in men than in women.A considerable
number of cases have occurred between thirty and forty years of age,
but the greatest frequency is after forty.At an earlier age than
twenty the disease is very rare.The causation of cirrhosis of the stomach is obscure.Nearly all
writers upon the subject have emphasized the abuse of alcohol as an
important cause in this as in other diseases of the stomach.Intemperance cannot, however, be the only cause; and here, as
elsewhere, it is not easy to say what importance is to be attached to
it as an etiological factor.In only one of the three cases which I
examined post-mortem could it be determined that the patient was an
immoderate drinker, and in one case intemperance could be positively
excluded.Other cases have been recorded in which the abuse of spirits
could be positively excluded.In one of my cases syphilis existed, as
was established by the presence of gummata in the liver.In some cases
the disease has been attributed to cicatrization of a gastric ulcer.In
a case reported by Snellen the disease followed an injury to the
epigastric region.[7]

[Footnote 7: _Canstatt's Jahresbericht_, 1856, iii.Cirrhosis of the stomach, as well as cancer, ulcer, and most other
chronic structural diseases of this organ, is usually associated with
chronic catarrhal gastritis.There is, however, no proof of the
prevalent idea that chronic catarrhal gastritis is the cause of the
enormous new growth of fibrous tissue which characterizes typical cases
of this disease.SYMPTOMATOLOGY AND DIAGNOSIS.--The symptoms of cirrhosis of the stomach
are not sufficiently characteristic to warrant a positive diagnosis.Like cancer of the
stomach, it may put on various disguises.Thus, in a case of cirrhosis
of the stomach reported by Nothnagel[8] the symptoms were {613}
typically those of progressive pernicious anaemia.Association with
ascites or with chronic peritonitis may lead to a false diagnosis.Thus, in one of the cases which I examined after death, and in which
there was chronic peritonitis with abundant fluid exudation, the
disease during life was diagnosticated as cirrhosis of the liver.Most
frequently, however, cirrhosis of the stomach is mistaken for gastric
cancer, from which, in fact, it can rarely be positively
diagnosticated.[Footnote 8: _Deutsches Arch.The symptoms are usually those of chronic dyspepsia, which sooner or
later assumes a severity which leads to the diagnosis of some grave
structural disease of the stomach, usually of cancer.Indigestion, loss of appetite, oppression in the epigastrium, vomiting,
are the common but in no way characteristic symptoms of cirrhosis of
the stomach.There may be severe gastralgia, but in general the disease
is less painful than either ulcer or cancer of the stomach.The
inability to take more than a small quantity of food or of drink at a
time, with the sense of fulness which even this small quantity
occasions, has been considered somewhat characteristic of cirrhosis of
the stomach, but this symptom is too inconstant, and occurs in too many
other affections of the stomach, to be of much service in diagnosis.The symptoms of dyspepsia are often of much longer duration than in
cancer, existing sometimes for many years (up to fifteen years), but on
the other hand there have been cases in which the clinical history of
gastric cirrhosis was as rapid in its progress as cancer.Moreover,
cancer may be preceded by dyspeptic symptoms of long duration, but long
duration is the exception with cancer and the rule with cirrhosis of
the stomach.As the disease progresses the patient loses flesh and strength, and
usually dies in a condition of marasmus.Blood is rarely present in the
vomit, but in a few cases the vomiting of coffee-ground material has
been noted.By physical examination sometimes a tumor in the region of the stomach
can be felt.Under favorable circumstances it can sometimes be
determined that this tumor is smooth, elastic, tympanitic on
percussion, and presents more or less distinctly the contours of the
stomach.By administering effervescing powder it may be possible to
obtain further evidence that the tumor corresponds in its form to the
stomach.The diagnosis of contraction of the cavity of the stomach is
not easy.Some information may be afforded by noting the length to
which the inflexible stomach-tube can be passed.The quantity of water
which can be poured into the stomach until it begins to run out of the
stomach-tube may also bring some confirmatory evidence as to the
existence of contraction of the stomach.Even should the physical signs suffice to determine that the tumor is
the thickened and contracted stomach, still cancer cannot be excluded,
for this also may grow diffusely in the gastric walls and may cause
contraction of the cavity of the stomach.With our present means of
diagnosis, therefore, the most which can be said is, that a special
combination of favorable circumstances may render probable the
diagnosis of cirrhosis of the stomach, but a positive diagnosis is
impossible.MORBID ANATOMY.--In most cases of cirrhosis of the stomach the stomach
is contracted.The cavity of the stomach has been found not larger than
would suffice to contain a hen's egg, but such extreme {614}
contraction is very rare.When the stomach in this disease is found
dilated, either the thickening involves only or chiefly the walls of
the pyloric portion, or the morbid process probably began there and was
followed by dilatation.In typical cases the walls of the entire stomach are thickened, but
frequently the thickening is most marked in the pyloric region.The
walls may measure an inch and even more in thickness.The thickened
walls are dense and firm, so that often upon incision the stomach does
not collapse.Upon transverse section the different coats of the stomach can be
distinguished.The mucous membrane is least affected, being sometimes
thickened, sometimes normal or atrophied.The muscularis mucosae is
hypertrophied, and is evident to the naked eye as a grayish band.The
submucous coat is of all the layers the most thickened, being sometimes
ten to fifteen times thicker than normal.It appears as a dense white
mass of fibrous tissue.The main muscular coat is also, as a rule,
greatly hypertrophied; the grayish, translucent muscular tissue is
pervaded with streaks of white fibrous tissue prolonged from the
submucous and subserous coats.This last coat resembles in appearance
the submucous coat, which, however, it does not equal in thickness,
although it is, proportionately to its normal thickness, much
hypertrophied.The free peritoneal surface usually appears opaque and
dense.To the naked eye it is apparent that the new growth of fibrous tissue
is most extensive in the submucous coat, which it is probably correct
to regard as the starting-point of the disease.The hypertrophy of the
muscular layers is also in most cases an important element in the
increased thickness of the gastric walls.Microscopical examination[9] shows sometimes a nearly normal mucous
membrane.The tubules, however, are usually more or less atrophied.In
the case reported by Nothnagel tubules could be found only in the
pyloric region of the stomach.The essential lesion is the new growth
of fibrillated connective tissue pervading all of the coats of the
stomach.In an interesting case reported by Marcy and Griffith,[10]
which was believed to be caused by an extensive cicatrized ulcer, a new
formation of smooth muscular tissue was found not only in the main
muscular tunic and the muscularis mucosae, but also throughout the
submucosa.This peculiarity was probably referable to the cicatrization
of the ulcer.[Footnote 9: Microscopical examination is always necessary for a
positive diagnosis of cirrhosis of the stomach.In a case which I
examined post-mortem of double ovarian cancer, with multiple secondary
deposits in the peritoneum and with chronic peritonitis, the stomach
presented the typical gross appearances of cirrhosis, but here and
there were to be found nests of cancer-cells in the prevailing new
growth of fibrous tissue in the walls of the stomach.]Sci._, July, 1884, p.Not infrequently adhesions exist between the stomach and surrounding
organs.Exceptionally, a diffuse growth of fibrous tissue may invade
the greater part of the peritoneum, particularly the visceral layer,
and cause a thickening similar to that existing in the stomach.In such
cases ascites is usually a marked symptom.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of cirrhosis of the stomach is grave.The
disease runs a chronic course, and usually terminates in death by
asthenia.There is no reason to believe that the stomach can ever be
restored to its {615} normal condition.Still, cases have been reported
in which it has been supposed that cirrhosis of the stomach has
terminated in recovery.[11] The diagnosis, however, in such cases must
remain doubtful.[Footnote 11: Lesser, _Cirrhosis Ventriculi_, Inaug.Diss., Berlin,
1876; Smith, "Cirrhosis of the Stomach," _Edinb.TREATMENT.--The treatment is symptomatic, and is to be guided by the
general principles developed in previous articles concerning the
regulation of the diet and the administration of remedies.HYPERTROPHIC STENOSIS OF THE PYLORUS.The various causes of stenosis of the pylorus have already been
mentioned under DILATATION OF THE STOMACH, and the most important of
these causes have received full consideration in connection with ULCER
and with CANCER OF THE STOMACH.Only one of the varieties of pyloric stenosis can claim consideration
as an independent disease.This variety is the so-called hypertrophic
stenosis of the pylorus (Lebert) or fibroid degeneration of the pylorus
(Habershon[12]).Under the name of hypertrophic stenosis have been
described cases in which the stenosis was due to hypertrophy of only
one of the coats of the stomach, usually either the submucous or the
muscular coat, sometimes only the mucous coat.In most cases, however,
all of the coats of the stomach are involved, and the lesion is similar
to that of cirrhosis of the stomach, but it is confined to the pylorus
or to the pyloric region.In such cases there is new growth of fibrous
tissue, most marked in the submucous coat, and hypertrophy of the
muscular coat.The appearance of the pylorus in some instances of
hypertrophic stenosis has been not inappropriately compared to that of
the cervix uteri.[Footnote 12: Habershon, _On Diseases of the Abdomen_, London, 1862;
Lebert, _Die Krankh.d. Magens_, Tubingen, 1878; Nauwerk, _Deutsches
Arch.In the majority of cases the change here described is the result of
cicatrization of a gastric ulcer, and some believe that all cases of
so-called hypertrophic stenosis or fibroid degeneration of the pylorus
are referable to ulcer, although it may be very difficult to discover
the cicatrix of the ulcer.It is certainly not always possible to
detect either ulcer or cicatrix, so that it seems proper to regard the
hypertrophic stenosis in such cases as constituting an independent
affection.The symptoms are those of dilatation of the stomach, sometimes preceded
by evidences of chronic catarrhal gastritis.The thickened pylorus can
sometimes be felt during life as a small, cylindrical, usually movable
tumor, either stationary in progress or of very slow growth.In most cases the diagnosis of organic stenosis of the pylorus can be
made.Cancer may sometimes be excluded by the long duration of the
symptoms and the stationary character of the tumor if a tumor can be
felt.The exclusion of ulcer is more difficult and hardly possible, for
ulcer may have existed without producing characteristic symptoms.The prognosis and treatment have been considered under DILATATION OF
THE STOMACH.{616} ATROPHY OF THE STOMACH.Atrophy of the stomach may be the result of stenosis of the cardia or
of the oesophagus.The stomach may participate with other organs in the
general atrophy attending inanition and marasmus.The walls of a
dilated stomach may be very thin.Especial importance has been attached in recent years to degeneration
and atrophy of the gastric tubules.The glands of the stomach may
undergo degeneration and atrophy in various diseases of the stomach,
such as chronic catarrhal gastritis, phlegmonous gastritis, cirrhosis
of the stomach, and cancer of the stomach.Parenchymatous and fatty
degeneration of the glandular cells of the stomach occurs in acute
infectious diseases, as typhoid fever and yellow fever, also as a
result of poisoning with phosphorus, arsenic, and the mineral acids.It is claimed by Fenwick that atrophy of the stomach may occur not only
as a secondary change, but also as a primary disease attended by grave
symptoms.Fenwick has described a number of cases in which the gastric
tubules were atrophied without thickening of the walls of the stomach
and without diminution in the size of the cavity of the stomach--cases,
therefore, which cannot be classified with cirrhosis of the
stomach.[13] He attributes in many cases the atrophy of the tubules to
an increase in the connective tissue of the mucous membrane, and draws
a comparison between atrophy of the stomach and the atrophic form of
chronic Bright's disease.[Footnote 13: _The Lancet_, 1877, July 7 _et seq._]

In 1860, Flint[14] called attention to the relation between anaemia and
atrophy of the gastric glands.He expressed the opinion that some cases
of obscure and profound anaemia are dependent upon degeneration and
atrophy of the glands of the stomach.Since Flint's publication cases
have been reported by Fenwick, Quincke, Brabazon, and Nothnagel, in
which lesions supposed to be due to pernicious anaemia have been found
after death associated with atrophy of the gastric tubules.[15]
Nothnagel's case, which has already been mentioned, was one of
cirrhosis of the stomach.[Footnote 14: A. Flint, _American Medical Times_, 1860.Further
contributions of Flint to this subject are to be found in the _New York
Medical Journal_, March, 1871, and in his _Treatise on the Principles
and Practice of Medicine_, p.[Footnote 15: Fenwick, _loc.cit._; Quincke, _Volkmann's Samml.100 (case _b_); Brabazon, _British Med.Journ._, 1878,
July 27 (without microscopical examination!); Nothnagel, _Deutsches
Arch.The symptoms which have been referred to primary atrophy of the stomach
are severe anaemia and disturbances of digestion, such as anorexia,
eructations, and vomiting.The digestive disturbances are often not
greater than are frequently observed in cases of severe anaemia.In my opinion, the existence of atrophy of the stomach as a primary and
independent disease has not been established.In many cases which have
been described as primary atrophy the histological investigation of the
stomach has been very defective.Degeneration and atrophy of the
gastric tubules secondary to various diseases of the stomach and to
certain general diseases is an important lesion when it is extensive,
and must seriously impair the digestion, and consequently the
nutrition, of the patient.{617} ANOMALIES IN THE FORM AND IN THE POSITION OF THE STOMACH.These anomalies, so far as they have not received consideration in
previous articles, are of more anatomical than clinical interest, and
therefore here require only brief mention.The stomach may have an hour-glass shape in consequence of a
constriction separating the cardiac from the pyloric half of the organ.This constriction is sometimes congenital,[16] sometimes caused by
cicatrization of a gastric ulcer, and sometimes caused by spasmodic
contraction of the muscle, which may persist after death, but
disappears when the stomach is artificially distended.Hour-glass shape
of the stomach has been diagnosed during life by administering an
effervescing powder according to Frerichs' method.[Footnote 16: A careful study of the congenital form of hour-glass
contraction of the stomach has been made by W. R. Williams ("Ten Cases
of Congenital Contraction of the Stomach," _Journ.and
Physiology_, 1882-83, p.Foreign substances of hard consistence which have been swallowed
sometimes cause diverticula of the stomach.Sometimes the fundus of the stomach is but little developed, so that
the organ is long and narrow like a piece of intestine.The stomach may be variously distorted by external pressure, as from
tumors and by adhesions.The loop-shaped stomach and vertical position of the stomach have been
already considered in connection with DILATATION OF THE STOMACH (page
602).In transposition of the viscera the stomach is also transposed.In such
a case difficulties may arise in the diagnosis of pyloric cancer, as in
a case described by Legroux.The stomach may be found in hernial sacs.Mention has already been made
of the presence of dilated stomachs in scrotal hernia.More frequently
the stomach is found in umbilical hernias.In diaphragmatic hernia the
stomach is found more frequently in the thorax than is any other
abdominal viscus.In 266 diaphragmatic hernias collected by Lascher[17]
the stomach was found either wholly or partly in the thorax in 161
cases.The clinical consideration of diaphragmatic hernia, however,
does not belong here.[Footnote 17: _Deutsches Arch.Furthermore, the stomach may be displaced by tumors, enlargement of
neighboring organs, tight-lacing, adhesions, and the weight of hernias.These displacements, however, are generally inconsiderable and of
little importance.In a case described by Mazotti[18] the stomach, of which the pyloric
portion was fixed by adhesions, was twisted around its long axis.[Footnote 18: _Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1874, ii.{618} RUPTURE OF THE STOMACH.Sufficient attention has already been given to perforation of the
stomach in consequence of diseases of its walls, such as ulcer, cancer,
abscesses, and toxic gastritis.A healthy stomach may be ruptured by violent injury to the abdomen even
when no external wound is produced.An example of rupture of the
stomach from this cause is that sometimes produced when a person has
been run over by a heavy vehicle.It has been claimed that a stomach with healthy walls may burst in
consequence of over-distension of the organ with solids or with gas.The older literature is especially rich in reports of so-called
spontaneous rupture of the stomach.Most of these cases were examples
of perforation of gastric ulcer.In a case of apparently spontaneous
rupture of a stomach which had become abnormally distended with gas,
Chiari[19] found that the rupture was through the cicatrix of a simple
ulcer in the lesser curvature.It is hardly conceivable that rupture of
the healthy stomach from over-distension can occur so long as the
orifices of the organ are unobstructed.Lautschner[20] reports a case of spontaneous rupture of the stomach in
a woman seventy years old with an enormous umbilical hernia which
contained the pyloric portion of the stomach.After drinking eight
glasses of water and two cups of tea and eating meat, she was seized
with vomiting, during which the stomach burst with a report which was
audible to the patient and to those around her.She passed into a state
of collapse and died in thirteen hours.A rent several centimeters long
was found in the posterior wall of the stomach.Lautschner thinks that
the pylorus was bent in the hernial sac so as to be obstructed.In the
walls of the stomach he found no evidence of pre-existing disease.[Footnote 20: _Virchow und Hirsch's Jahresbericht_, 1881, ii.]There is no satisfactory proof of the possibility of the occurrence of
rupture of a stomach with healthy walls except as a result of external
violence.The symptoms and treatment of rupture of the stomach are those of
perforation of the stomach, and have already been described.That the subject of gastromalacia should still occupy so much space in
medical works the purpose of which is mainly clinical proves that many
physicians still cling to the belief that this process may occur during
life.It is, nevertheless, certain that the condition which, according
to the ordinary and traditional use of the term, is designated
gastromalacia, is always a post-mortem process and is without the
slightest clinical significance.So long as the circulation of the
blood in the walls of the stomach is undisturbed, self-digestion of
this organ cannot occur.No one doubts {619} that parts of the gastric
walls in which the circulation has been arrested, and which are exposed
to the gastric juice, undergo self-digestion, as has already been set
forth in the article on GASTRIC ULCER.To describe cases of this nature
under the name of gastromalacia, however, is misleading, and can cause
only confusion, for the long-continued discussion as to whether
gastromalacia is a vital or a cadaveric process applied certainly to a
different conception of the term.In some of the cases which have been
published, even in recent years, in support of the vitalistic theory of
gastromalacia, and in which it has been proven that perforation of the
stomach occurred during life, the solution of continuity took place
through parts of the gastric walls in which the circulation had already
been obstructed, particularly by extensive hemorrhagic infiltration.Some of these cases are probably also examples of perforation of
gastric ulcer or of rupture of cicatrices from over-distension of the
stomach, in which post-mortem digestion of the edges of the ulcer or of
the cicatrix obscured the real nature of the process.The subject of
gastromalacia should be relegated wholly to works on physiology and on
pathological anatomy.{620}

INTESTINAL INDIGESTION.BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.NATURE.--The term indigestion in its most common meaning refers to
gastric indigestion only.This limitation has arisen from the fact that
gastric digestion has been more thoroughly understood than intestinal
digestion, and because the symptoms, flatulence, acidity, eructations
of gas, pyrosis, and vomiting of unaltered food, are readily referred
to the stomach as their source.Intestinal digestion has not been well
known until within a recent date, and its phenomena in disease have
been mistaken for other pathological conditions.From the important and complex function of the intestinal juices, and
the very great share they take in the solution of food, there must be
many phases of departure from the normal state.The processes of
intestinal digestion are more intricate than those of gastric
digestion, of a higher grade, and the chemical reactions are more
numerous, depending upon the participation of the bile, the pancreatic
juice, and the succus entericus; while intestinal absorption is a more
complex act than that of gastric absorption.A brief review of the physiology of intestinal digestion will be of aid
in making clear its pathology.The object of all digestion is to make such a solution of the ingesta
that they may pass through animal membrane and so enter the system.Mechanical disintegration and simple solution do something toward this,
but for substances insoluble in water a more thorough change is brought
about by ferments which convert insoluble into soluble compounds.Mastication breaks up the
masses of food; the saliva softens them, dissolves soluble substances,
as salt and sugar, and thus the pleasures of the palate are enhanced.The ferment ptyalin acts upon starch (boiled starch being more rapidly
altered than unboiled), and changes it to dextrin and grape-sugar, both
of which are diffusible through animal membrane, entering lymph-spaces
and blood-vessels.The greater part of the saliva secreted is swallowed
with the food or in the intervals of eating.The amount formed in
twenty-four hours varies from 1500 gm.(Bidder and Schmidt) to 700 gm.It must therefore serve some ulterior purpose in the stomach.Ewald[1] says that saliva converts starch into sugar in acid as well as
in alkaline and neutral solutions.But Langley[2] asserts that the
ferment of {621} saliva is destroyed by the hydrochloric acid of the
gastric juice.The longer food is subjected to mastication and
insalivation, the more thorough is the mouth digestion and the better
prepared is the mass for the action of the gastric and intestinal
juices.It is asserted that fatty matters are emulsified to a certain
extent by the alkaline ferments of the saliva.[Footnote 1: _Lectures on Digestion_, New York, 1881, p.[Footnote 2: "On the Destruction of Ferments in the Alimentary Canal,"
_Journal of Physiology_, London, Jan., 1882, p.When the food enters the stomach the nitrogenous (albuminoid) elements
are attacked by the gastric juice, the bundles of muscular fibre are
broken up, the fibrillae are reduced to a granular mass, but not
completely dissolved (Frerichs), the fat-globules are freed from their
envelopes of connective tissue, milk is coagulated, and the casein is
dissolved."The tangible, practical object of this change is to form out of a
little-diffusible body (albumen) one easily diffusible (peptone), which
is capable of absorption through animal membrane in a higher degree
than ordinary albumen" (Ewald).Peptone is formed out of ordinary
albumen, as grape-sugar is formed out of starch, by taking up water; it
is therefore the hydrate of albumen.The more tardy the digestion in the stomach the more highly charged
with acid is the gastric juice.According to Wright, the degree of
alkalinity of the saliva is in proportion to the acidity of the stomach
fluids, and Bence Jones has observed that during the excretion of acid
in the stomach the total alkalinity of all alkaline digestive fluids is
increased.The lesson is thus learned that a too careful preparation of
food, so as to shorten and lessen gastric labor, diminishes the
activity of the gastric juice as well as that of all other digestive
fluids.Intestinal digestion begins when the softened mass passes through the
pylorus.This mass (chyme) is composed of (1) the products of gastric
digestion which have not been absorbed--peptone, dextrose, levulose,
peptonized gelatin, with mucus and gastric juice; (2) all matters which
have escaped digestion--the starch of vegetable substances, dissolved
gelatin and albumen which have not been peptonized, and some unaltered
muscle-structure; and (3) fat, fatty acids, and cellulose upon which
neither saliva nor gastric juice has had any influence (Ewald).This complex semi-fluid mass with an acid reaction enters the duodenum
and comes in contact with fluids and ferments destined to work
remarkable changes in its composition.The first of these fluids is the
bile, which is alkaline and composed of the glycocholate and
taurocholate of sodium, cholesterin, soaps, etc., phosphates and
carbonates of lime and sodium, chlorides of potassium and sodium,
bile-pigment, etc.The outflow of bile is excited by the contact of the
chyme with the orifice of the bile-duct.When the alkaline bile is
mingled with the acid mass in the duodenum, it neutralizes its acidity,
precipitates the peptones, and therefore stops all further action of
the gastric juice.Fats containing free fatty acids are emulsified,
soaps being formed by a combination of the alkalies of the bile with
the fatty acids.Lastly, bile hinders fermentation in the intestine and
acts as a purgative by exciting peristalsis.Absorption is probably
also favored by bile, as it has been found that emulsified fats pass
more readily through an animal membrane which has been wet with
bile.[3]

[Footnote 3: Ewald thinks this result is doubtful: in animals killed
during digestion he has found an acid reaction in the contents of the
intestine beyond the opening of the bile-duct, with no precipitation of
the albumen (_op.{622} As far as we now know, the function of the bile is to neutralize
the acidity of the duodenal contents, and thus pave the way for the
action of a digesting fluid of much greater potency and of much higher
function.[4]

[Footnote 4: In order still further to demonstrate the necessity of
bile-action as a preparation for pancreatic digestion, it may be
mentioned that in artificial experiments, with a heat equal to that of
the body, if antiseptics analogous to gastric juice and bile are not
used, there is a too rapid change from alkalinity to acidity, and
consequently all of the starch is not converted into sugar before it
develops lactic acid with putrefactive disorganization.A deficiency of
bile, therefore, is a cause of intestinal indigestion (Bartlett, _op.This fluid, the pancreatic juice, is composed of inorganic salts,
albuminoids, and certain specific ferments, and has an alkaline
reaction.It has a threefold operation upon the softened mass with
which it now comes in contact: 1.The starch of vegetable matter, which
has been only slightly acted on up to this time, is now rapidly
converted into grape-sugar by a peculiar diastatic ferment more active
than any other known ferment.Albuminous matters (proteids) which
have escaped digestion in the stomach are changed into a soluble and
absorbable pancreas--peptone.Trypsin is the active ferment in this
case (Kuhne), and it is only in alkaline or neutral solutions that the
albuminoids are readily dissolved.The necessity of neutralization by
the alkaline bile is thus demonstrated.A ferment distinct from the
others splits the fats into fatty acids and glycerin, and emulsifies
them so that they can be taken up by the lacteals lower down.Experiments made by mixing albuminates with pancreatic gland-extract,
under favorable conditions, show after a certain time the presence of
leucin, tyrosin, hypoxanthin, and asparaginic acid.In a feebly
alkaline or neutral solution a faint putrefactive odor is soon noticed,
with the development of bacteria; ammonia, sulphuretted hydrogen,
hydrogen, and carbonic acid--evidences of the putrefaction of
albumen--are also detected.It is difficult to tell when normal digestion in the intestines ends
and putrefaction begins.The conclusion is, that the normal action of
pancreatic juice (trypsin) gives origin to bodies met with in the
ordinary putrefaction of albumen.[5] This thin border-line between
normal intestinal digestion and the decomposition of the intestinal
contents has an important bearing on the facts of intestinal
indigestion.[Footnote 5: Ewald, _op.The intestinal juice performs a minor but independent part in
digestion.It converts albuminous matter into peptone, and hydrated
starch into sugar.Its function is therefore supplementary to that of
the gastric and pancreatic secretions.[6]

[Footnote 6: Ewald, _op.103; also, "The Functions of the
Intestinal Juice," Charles L. Dana, _Med.News_, Philada., July 15,
1882, p.When food enters the mouth the process of digestion begins, and all the
activities of the glands concerned in digestion are probably at once
set in motion.Mastication excites, by reflex action, pancreatic
secretion; the acid chyme touches the orifice of the common bile-duct
and stimulates the outflow of bile; the neutralized chyme next invites
pancreatic digestion.For the integrity of intestinal digestion it is
required that mastication and stomach digestion should be normally
performed.The intestinal movements which are so necessary to digestion by making
successive changes in the position of the intestinal contents are {623}
controlled by nervous arrangements, but may occur independently of the
central nervous system.The ganglia of Auerbach and of Meissner in the
intestinal wall are sufficient for the development of peristaltic
waves.The irritation of the mucous membrane by food, hyperaemia, and
the pouring out of digestive juices, and intestinal movements, are
parts of one process.Paralysis by section of the splanchnic leads to
hyperaemia of the intestinal vessels and increased peristalsis;
stimulation of the splanchnic causes anaemia of the intestinal wall and
arrest of movement.Local cold by producing anaemia brings about the
same result.The products of digestion as they pass toward the jejunum consist of
diffusible peptones, sugar, emulsified fats and oils, and substances
which have escaped digestion, as fragments of muscular fibre,
starch-corpuscles, connective tissue, hairs, or other foreign matters.The bowel contains also carbonic acid, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphuretted
hydrogen, and marsh gas.The mass, alkaline or neutral in the duodenum
and jejunum, becomes acid in the ileum from the putrefaction of albumen
and fermentation.The peptones and sugar pass by osmosis into the
blood-vessels of the portal system and thence to the liver.In the
liver the sugar is converted into glycogen (carbohydrate), and stored
in the liver-cells until needed for the maintenance of animal heat and
for the nutrition of the tissues.The peptones are used in part to
supply the nitrogenous waste of tissue, but much of the albuminoid
matter is broken up in the liver into glycogen and urea, the latter of
which is excreted by the kidneys as waste matter.The minute granules of oil in emulsion are taken up by the epithelial
cells covering the villi; thence they enter the adenoid tissue of the
villi on their way to the lymphatic radicles, the lacteals.From here
the passage is open to the underlying lymphatic vessels and to the
larger abdominal lymph-vessels and the thoracic duct beyond.Intestinal digestion is not completed and the body does not receive its
pabulum until the products of digestion have reached the liver and the
thoracic duct.ETIOLOGY.--It is usually said that intestinal dyspepsia is more common
in women than in men, but the contrary is the rule.Some of its most
common causes--over-eating and the eating of indigestible food--are
especially vices of men.It is more frequent between the ages of forty and fifty, but no age is
exempt.Infants at the breast, children of any age, adults, and old men
and women are alike subject to it.Men in middle life begin to suffer
from the imprudence and carelessness of youth and from the anxiety and
cares of business.The indulged children of rich parents and improperly
bottle-fed infants frequently suffer.Heredity and idiosyncrasy have a certain influence in determining the
prevalence of intestinal dyspepsia.The distaste for and inability to
digest vegetables, fruits, and fats are often peculiarities of family
history.The occurrence of cases in the same family is often explained
by improper food, bad cooking, and irregular hours, to the evil
influences of which all the members are similarly subjected.All conditions of the organism which result in a depraved or altered
blood-supply, as anaemia, primary and secondary rachitis, chronic
syphilis, and continued febrile diseases, are causes of intestinal
indigestion.{624} The connection of the indigestion of fats with the
strumous diathesis and with phthisis is undisputed.J. Hughes Bennett
traced the origin of phthisis to defective fat-digestion; strumous
indigestion and the indigestion of fat are synonymous terms.Debilitating influences, such as bad air, want of cleanliness and
outdoor exercise, impair functional activity in the intestines as
elsewhere.Sexual excesses, but especially masturbation, have a special
influence for evil in this direction.The influence of the mind upon the digestion of starch and fats is even
greater than upon gastric digestion, for no other reason perhaps than
that the former is a more complex function and less easily relieved
than the latter.Prolonged or excessive mental labor does not do so
much harm as mental worry, over-anxiety, and the strain and overwork of
business.Professional men--lawyers, physicians, and clergymen--who
become over-burdened with responsibilities, and who sympathize too much
with the distresses of others, are very prone to suffer.The careworn
face with lines about the mouth and forehead is one of the plainest
signs of duodenal defect.The proper secretion of the juices of the
intestine and normal peristalsis are impossible where brain and nerves
get no rest.The too rapid mental development of the children of the
present day is a fruitful source of weakened fat-and-starch digestion
and of impaired development.So long as children are sent to the public
school at four and six years of age, there will continue to grow up a
precocious race with active brains in feeble bodies.[7] This injurious
result is largely brought about by the direct interference of premature
brain-development with the complex intestinal processes of digestion
and absorption.[Footnote 7: In eight of the States and Territories the minimum age for
entering the public school is fixed at four years; in seventeen States
at five years; in the others, except two, at six years.The two notable
exceptions are Alabama and New Mexico, where children do not enter
school until the age of seven.]Wealth, with ease and inactivity, and sedentary occupations, contribute
to the same end by lessening the need of food, and thus debilitating
the organs of digestion by inaction.Sedentary pursuits, especially
those in which the body is bent forward and constricted or compressed
at the waist, interfere with active function in the intestine.This is
the case in tailors, shoemakers, etc.Tight-lacing in women and a too
tight trouser-band in men are injurious.Hot climates, especially when combined with dampness, lead to disorder
in the intestine and liver.This effect is most marked among persons
coming from colder climates, as among the English in India, who keep up
the habits of eating to which they have been accustomed at home.The
lessened demand destroys the appetite, and stimulants and condiments
are resorted to to whip up the inactive functions.The intestine is
loaded with a mass of crude, unaltered matter which can with difficulty
be disposed of.Chronic indigestion results, varied with acute attacks
of diarrhoea or dysentery.The portal system is filled with an excess
of albuminoid material which the liver is unable to store away.The
excess is got rid of by conversion into uric acid.Lithaemia and
chronic congestion and enlargement of the overloaded liver result, with
their many attendant evils.Over-eating occasions first gastric and then intestinal indigestion by
the {625} entrance of unaltered food into the duodenum.Eating without
hunger often involves the taking of food which the body does not need
and which the stomach cannot digest.Diners-out rarely go through a
season without one or more internal revolts.A too-varied diet, a
dinner of many dishes, is faulty in variety as well as in excess.On
the other hand, a too great sameness in diet and the prolonged use of
one or two articles of food which are not easy of digestion, and which
have a great deal of waste, fatigue and then disorder intestinal
digestion.This is a fault into which children are often allowed to
fall.Indigestible food and an excess of starchy or fatty food conduce to
disorder of duodenal digestion.In conditions of debility and anaemia
and in the convalescence of fevers the deficiency of saliva involves an
inability to digest starch in the mouth and points to a corresponding
want in the duodenal secretions.The improper use of alcoholic liquors,
taking them on an empty stomach between meals and in excess, tends to
direct irritation of the mucous tract.Condiments in large quantity
have the same effect.Irregularity in the hours of eating and a faulty distribution of the
amount of food disturb the perfect working of the mechanism of
digestion.Very light breakfasts and very late and large dinners are
injurious.The habit, now quite general in cities, of deferring the
breakfast proper until midday, leaves the system too long--fifteen to
sixteen hours--without proper food and weakens digestive activity.Intestinal indigestion is very common among Americans who have lived
abroad and adopted European customs.Another cause which is unfortunately very common is the imperfect
mastication and insalivation of food, due to too great haste in eating,
to defects in the teeth or gums, or to a deficiency of saliva.The
saliva no doubt sometimes possesses a feeble diastatic power, although
abundant in amount.Carnivorous animals bolt their food, but
vegetable-eaters must masticate.Slow mastication transforms starch
into sugar, and at the same time excites secretive activity in the
glands of the digestive tract, especially in the pancreas.The more
thoroughly this preliminary function is performed the better
preparation is there for the subsequent acts of digestion.[8]

[Footnote 8: "The familiar act of chewing is seldom a subject of
reflection, yet it throws into motion a more complicated system of
levers, accompanied by a drain of fluids from more curiously adapted
apparatus, than the arts can parallel" (Leared, _On Indigestion_,
London, 1863, p.The chewing of tobacco, a wretched habit which is much less common now
than formerly, and to a less extent the habit of smoking, are causes of
deficient, altered, or depraved saliva, and secondarily of altered
pancreatic secretion.The thin smoker grows fat when he abandons the
weed.The normal functions of the intestines are interfered with and
indigestion is set up by constipation.Every one has felt the activity
in digestion which accompanies the regular habit of defecation, and the
torpor and oppression which depend upon an unemptied colon."There is a
concert of action in virtue of which the whole muscular apparatus of
the digestive tube sympathizes with that of the large intestine.This
concert of action, which induces pathological states, is the reason why
in the {626} physiological state a regular contraction of the whole
intestinal tube, including the stomach, is the consequence of the
regular contraction of the large intestine."[9]

[Footnote 9: Trousseau, "Les Dyspepsies," _L'Union medicale_, tome xi.,
1857, p.An excess of acid in the stomach would enfeeble the solvent power of
the intestinal fluids by antagonizing neutralization by the alkaline
bile; the same effect follows any cause which prevents the outflow of
the bile, as the plugging of the common bile-duct by mucus and
epithelium in catarrh or by an impacted gall-stone.The emulsification
of fats is incomplete and decomposition in the intestine follows.The
antagonism of the saliva and the gastric juice, of the gastric juice
(or the chyme) and the bile, must preserve their delicate and nice
adjustment in order for digestion to be properly performed.Diseases of the pancreas seriously embarrass digestion in the
intestine.Lesions of this organ, as catarrh of the duct, cancer, fatty
degeneration, etc., may result in impaired emulsification of fats,
fatty diarrhoea, and wasting.Intestinal indigestion accompanies hyperaemia and catarrh of the
intestinal mucous membrane, diseases of the heart, lungs, and liver,
and all other causes which impede portal circulation.SYMPTOMS.--Intestinal indigestion cannot be so clearly pictured as that
of gastric dyspepsia.This is owing to the frequent concurrence of the
two conditions, the gastric symptoms taking precedence of the others.The more complex nature of the intestinal function is another reason,
intestinal indigestion having more modifications in its phenomena.In
the stomach there is only one active secretion; in the intestine there
are three, all participants in the act of solution.An alteration in
the quality or quantity of one of these--the bile, for example--would
lead to different symptomatic results than would follow another
defective secretion, as that of the pancreas, for instance.Clinical
study has not yet fully differentiated the forms of indigestion due to
these several deficiencies.But there are certain well-defined symptoms
associated with intestinal disorders which are distinguished by their
seat, time of their appearance, and their character from analogous
symptoms connected with the stomach.Intestinal indigestion may be acute or chronic.The latter is the more
typical and more common form.When a sudden attack of indigestion in the intestine results from the
entrance into the duodenum of food in such a state that it cannot be
digested, the result is the rapid development of pain, flatulence,
borborygmi, and frequently of fever, ending in diarrhoea, with the
escape perhaps of the offending matter: a condition then exists which
may be called acute or subacute intestinal catarrh or acute intestinal
indigestion.One name would be as correct as the other.Slight acute
forms are marked by a coated tongue, loss of appetite, headache, pains
in the limbs, distress in the epigastrium or right hypochondrium,
flatulence, and constipation.These might be accompanied by symptoms
indicating a disorder of the liver functions--light- stools,
slight jaundice, lithates in the urine.But intestinal indigestion
alone can cause these symptoms without the condition of so-called
biliousness being present.The local symptoms are due to the presence
in the intestine of an {627} imperfectly-altered mass and the
development of gas; some of the general symptoms are reflex; others, as
headache and lassitude and pain in the limbs, come from the absorption
into the blood of the gases, particularly sulphuretted hydrogen.The
participation of the stomach in acute attacks of this sort modifies the
symptoms as here described.Such attacks are apt to recur at intervals.If the causes which bring about acute disorder in the intestine are
allowed to continue, the intervals between the acute or subacute
attacks diminish, and there is in time a fixed state of chronic
intestinal dyspepsia in which the partly-altered food coming from the
stomach is not properly prepared for absorption.Instead of digestion
there is decomposition; the transition is easy from the one to the
other of these states.The symptoms connected in this case with the
digestive organs are pain, occurring from two to six hours after
eating, in the right hypochondrium, the epigastrium, or the umbilical
region, due to distension of the intestine with gas.This pain is dull,
not always fixed, lasts from one to three hours, and is accompanied by
tenderness on pressure over its seat.Tympanites, borborygmi, and a sensation of fulness in the abdomen
accompany the pain or may exist without it.Gaseous accumulations in
the intestine, the cause of these symptoms, have an independent source,
being produced by decomposition in the gut itself, and are not due to
the descent of gases from the stomach through the pylorus.What is a
physiological and temporary condition becomes in disease a distressing
symptom of long duration.In intestinal indigestion the gut is nearly
always inflated with gas, which in its movement produces rumbling
noises.In acute indigestion it is rapidly formed in large amount, and
by the stretching of the wall of the bowel and pressure on
nerve-filaments causes intense pain--colic.In the chronic form the
distension excites uneasy sensations, prevents sleep, and may be so
great as to cause dyspnoea by pushing the diaphragm upward.When the
small intestine is distended the greatest swelling may be about the
umbilicus, or the abdomen may be evenly rounded.When the colon is
chiefly or solely inflated, its outline across the upper part or at the
sides of the abdomen can be easily made out.It is produced by a loss of
contractility of the intestinal wall.The more direct causes are
over-distension of the gut and disturbance in the circulation and
innervation of its walls.The stools are hard and dry, and are expelled
with difficulty.Sometimes they are coated with shreds or films of
mucus, the product of a chronic catarrh of the mucous membrane of the
colon, or mucus from the small intestine is intimately mixed with the
mass.Diarrhoea may alternate with constipation.The passage of
unaltered food, as fragments of meat, vegetables, or fruit, clearly
shows the extent to which indigestion exists.By the microscope
particles of food which have escaped complete disintegration may be
detected.Very dark-green or black discharges
show an excess of bile; light-yellow or gray slate-, a
deficiency.Stools of the latter character are highly offensive in
odor.Hemorrhoids are often present, being due to the sluggish portal
circulation and to the pressure of hard fecal masses in the rectum.The
appetite is not impaired, as a rule, but it may be fitful or irregular.A bad {628} taste in the mouth, and a swollen, relaxed, and coated
tongue may exist without any decided gastric disease.The symptoms of disorder of the nervous system are more marked than in
gastric dyspepsia.This results not so much from the depressing
influences of pain as from the peculiar malnutrition of the
nerve-tissue.In order to have furnished to the blood the pabulum out
of which the nerve-elements are reconstructed the digestion of fat must
be normally performed.Lecithin, which is found conspicuously in the
brain and nerves, is a complex fat containing phosphorus and
nitrogen.[10] Anaemia and waste follow directly from interference with
the digestion and absorption of fats and starch in the intestine, but
the most delicate, the most easily-disorganized solid of the body, the
nerve-tissue, is the first to feel and to manifest its want of natural
supply.And so the dyspeptic whose intestine is at fault becomes
depressed in spirits, hypochondriacal, absorbed in the contemplation of
his sufferings, analyzing them and referring them to the most serious
organic changes.There are sleeplessness, disturbing dreams, the habit
of waking at a fixed hour, dizziness, uneasy sensations or pain in the
head, and disturbances of the special senses, as buzzing in the ears,
muscae volitantes, and attacks of blindness.Headache assumes often the
form of hemicrania; it may be in the forehead or about the eyes.Attacks of vertigo and sensations as if the ground were rising beneath
the feet accompany intestinal flatulence.Confusion of thought, loss of
the power of application, and mental inertia are frequent sources of
anxiety.Paralysis has been noted as following indigestion.Epileptiform convulsions and milder epileptic attacks can be traced to
undigested matter in the intestine.[11] Various modifications of
general sensibility also happen: there are pains in the back and limbs,
hyperaesthesia, and anaesthesia.An inaptitude for exertion, especially
for mental labor, forces the boy to give up school and college life.Successful careers are abandoned by men who at the cost of neglecting
all the rules of health have succeeded for a brief period in passing
their fellows in the race.Sudden attacks of fainting have been noted,
with very grave collapse.These are the effect upon the nervous centres
of the absorption of sulphuretted hydrogen which has been evolved in
large quantities in the intestine.[12] The daily occurrence of
vertiginous and other morbid sensations, with melancholia, may be due
to the daily toxic absorption of gas from the intestine.[Footnote 10: Fothergill, _Indigestion and Biliousness_, New York,
1881, p.[Footnote 11: Chambers, _The Indigestions_, London, 1867, pp.[Footnote 12: Tyrell, case of a man with eructations smelling of
sulphuretted hydrogen who had vertigo and sudden collapse; symptoms
relieved by purgative (_Pacific Med.Journ._, May, 1882, p.The action of the heart is disturbed as in stomach indigestion.Irritability of the heart and palpitation are in part due to anaemia
and in part to mechanical pressure and reflex influences.The nervous,
anaemic, thin dyspeptic has among his chief troubles a throbbing heart,
which keeps him awake at night and fixes his attention upon this organ
as the seat of his disease.The general circulation is languid; cold
hands and feet and cold sweats testify to this, and the irregularity or
suppression of catamenia follows upon the irregular blood-supply.The urine is usually high-, has an abnormally high density, is
acid, and on cooling deposits lithates, uric acid, and oxalate-of-lime
{629} crystals.The urine is most heavily loaded with sediment when
digestion has been recently completed.Therefore, the morning urine
after a heavy dinner of the night before contains the largest amount of
lithates.Albuminuria is occasionally a symptom of indigestion in the
bowel.The eating of cheese or pastry in excess may cause it.[13]
Seminal emissions at night frequently occur.The action and reaction
upon each other of this perversion of the sexual function, the
indigestion, and the mental disorder, reduce the poor sufferer to a
most pitiable condition of despondency and prostration.[14]

[Footnote 13: Warburton Begbie's _Works_, Sydenham Society's
Publications, 1882, p.[Footnote 14: The writer has observed cases in which an exaggeration of
the sexual instinct in men of middle age was associated with intestinal
indigestion.]Anaemia is one of the earliest indications of impaired nutrition.It
precedes loss of flesh and the wrinkled and dry condition of the skin
which may be a marked symptom in cases of long standing.Various
eruptions appear on the skin.In the strumous dyspepsia of children the
white, almost waxy, skin is covered with dry scales, which may be seen
over the whole body from head to foot.No symptom is more
characteristic of intestinal indigestion and of imperfect fat digestion
and absorption than this.Eczema and psoriasis, pityriasis, impetigo,
and porrigo decalvans are forms of skin eruption seen.Closely allied to the symptoms caused by indigestion in the intestine
are those due to functional disorder of the liver.The liver completes
the work which the intestine has begun.It receives directly from the
intestine blood laden with the products of digestion, and further
transforms them into substances to be used in the economy.The symptoms
which result from disturbances in the performance of these functions
are, as has been said, closely connected with the symptoms of
intestinal indigestion.This association is shown by the tendency among
older writers to trace all such symptoms to the liver, the terms
bilious and biliousness including all the phenomena of derangement of
the function of digestion in the intestine, as well of the function of
the liver.Later writers excluded the part of the liver to a great
extent in giving rise to the so-called bilious symptoms.Recent
physiological study has shown how closely the intestine and the liver
are associated in health and in disease.When the liver is implicated
in indigestion the symptoms which follow are due either to a deficiency
of the secretion of bile, and the resultant disturbance of digestion in
the intestine, or to a derangement in the transformation in the liver
of the products of albuminoid digestion.When the disorganization of
the peptones is imperfectly performed in the liver, instead of urea
there is a production of lithates and lithic acid, constituting the
condition called lithaemia.The lithates pass into the urine and are
deposited.The occurrence of this urinary sediment after excesses and
imprudences in diet is well known.The continuance of lithaemia leads
to the development of symptoms more or less characteristic.These are a
loss of appetite and coated tongue, flatulence, oppression after
eating, and constipation.The nervous system is soon disturbed, and
often to a marked extent.Vertigo, headache, disturbances of the
special senses, sleeplessness at night, drowsiness during the day,
annoy the patient and induce extreme hypochondria.He is worried,
moreover, with numbness and tingling in one or both arms or in the
{630} legs, and hence spring fears of paralysis.The heart is disturbed
in action, and is irregular and feeble.Emaciation in previously
corpulent persons is not unfrequent.COURSE, TERMINATION, AND SEQUELAE.--Acute dyspepsia in the bowel lasts
from a few hours to a day or two, and ends in leaving the patient as
well as before.A diarrhoea of indefinite duration may follow.Chronic intestinal indigestion in infants and young children often
continues until the diet is changed to one suited to the powers of
digestion.In adults interference with so important a function cannot
but have the most serious results.While the progress is slow, lasting
many years, there is a steady march from bad to worse.The character and conduct are so altered by the disease that a man may
be said to be just what his digestion makes him.Amiability under the
daily goad of intestinal dyspepsia is an impossibility.The
irreconcilables, the men out of joint with the world, are living
witnesses of the antagonism and disaffection within their intestines.The deterioration in health paves the way for many diseases, and there
is hardly an organ in the body which may not ultimately become the seat
of organic change.In the young, phthisis is frequently the ultimate result of the
malassimilation and malnutrition; in men beyond middle life
degenerative changes in the intestine, liver, and kidneys close the
series of morbid changes which began in the intestine.Thomas N.
Reynolds attributes bronchitis and phthisis in part to the local
influence of septic matter carried by the portal and lacteal vessels to
the lungs in cases of intestinal dyspepsia, with constipation and
septic fermentation of the ingesta.[15]

[Footnote 15: Paper read before section of Practical Medicine at
meeting of Am.In many cases business and professions are abandoned, and men become,
under the influence of despair and complete absorption in their
symptoms, intellectual and moral wrecks, burdens to themselves and to
all around them.In this stage the primary cause, the dyspepsia, is
lost in the exaggerated prominence of the nervous symptoms.DIAGNOSIS.--The acute variety is known by the seat of the abdominal
symptoms, the pain, distension, and movement of gas not being in the
stomach, but in the intestines.The pain is like colic; the abdomen is
sensitive to the touch; tympanites is general and may be very great.If
vomiting occurs, the symptoms continue after the stomach is empty.Diarrhoea may quickly come on, and is followed by relief.There is no sleep, but restlessness, and in children
delirium.In the chronic form the history of the case and the study of the causes
are of great value in formulating an opinion.The persistent abuse of
the pleasures of the table sooner or later develops intestinal
indigestion.Inquiry into the mode of life, hours of eating, manner of
eating, kinds of food taken, etc.The
teeth are defective, and mastication and insalivation are neglected.There is distress in the pit of the stomach or in the right
hypochondrium, beginning about two hours after eating and lasting from
four to six hours; intestinal distension with gas, either in the small
intestine or colon, with borborygmi and constipation, is generally
present.The nervous symptoms are characteristic: they are depression
of spirits, irritability, sleeplessness, vertigo, and {631} headache.The man is more completely altered mentally than in gastric dyspepsia.The urine contains lithates in excess; anaemia and emaciation progress
rapidly.Seminal emissions and weight and heaviness about the loins are
present.The following symptoms distinguish gastric dyspepsia, and do not occur
in intestinal indigestion unless the stomach is at the same time
involved: pain or weight in the epigastrium immediately after eating,
vomiting of unaltered food, of food in a state of acid fermentation,
eructations of ill-tasting or bad-smelling gas or of acid fluid,
water-brash, and heartburn.Loss of flesh may not take place to any
extent even in very bad forms.The diagnosis of differences in the forms of indigestion due to defects
in the pancreatic, biliary, or intestinal secretions is not at present
a matter of precise knowledge.A pancreatic indigestion would be
followed, it might be supposed invariably, by fatty stools; but such is
not the case, since degeneration of the pancreas and closure of the
duct have occurred without fatty evacuations from the bowels.[16]
Moreover, ulceration of the duodenum is followed sometimes by fat in
the stools.Still, if the symptoms of intestinal indigestion include
rapid wasting and fatty diarrhoea, we may conclude that the pancreas is
at fault.It may be seen as
oil-drops passed alone or with fecal matter, or as lumps of fat, pale
yellow and tallow-like.Glycosuria[17] bears some relation to
pancreatic diseases, and therefore may be an aid in diagnosis.[Footnote 16: Ewald, _op.95; D. S. Haldane, "Cancer of
Pancreas," _Edin.77; J. S.

Head of Pancreas," _ibid._, vol.[Footnote 17: Bright, "Cases and Observation connected with Diseases of
the Pancreas," _Med.-Chir.A deficient excretion of bile is indicated by a whitish or yellowish
coating of the tongue, with loss of appetite and bad taste in the
mouth.The stools are scanty, dry, slate- or white, and
offensive in smell.The patient is languid,
often irritable and hypochondriacal.He complains of headache, and is
dull and drowsy after eating.The heart's action is unsteady,
intermittent, or frequent.It is impossible to recognize indigestion
due solely to a deficiency of the intestinal juice or to feeble
peristalsis, granting that such forms exist.PROGNOSIS.--A fatal result does not follow directly from intestinal
indigestion.Its complications and results are frequently the causes of
death.Treated early and with decision, a cure can be expected.Everything depends upon the extent to which the patient submits to the
strict directions of his physician; his whole life must be made
subordinate to the plan of treatment.When the general health has become profoundly altered there is less
chance to do good.Discouraging symptoms are anaemia, debility,
coexisting gastric dyspepsia, an inherited hypochondriacal tendency, or
the strumous diathesis in children.When the disease has so far progressed that the patient is unable to
{632} rouse himself to the point of wishing to be well, only the most
severe measures directed to the control of an irresponsible person can
save him from ruin.In organic disease of the pancreas, intestine,
liver, or heart the result will depend upon the nature and curability
of the lesion.TREATMENT.--Acute intestinal indigestion due to the presence of
undigested food and gas in the intestine is treated by relieving
present distress and procuring a free movement from the bowels.A large
enema or a quick cathartic followed by an opiate--hypodermic injection
of morphia, paregoric, or other preparation--may give early relief.A
strict diet, warm poultices over the abdomen, and an anodyne may be
needed for several days after.The integrity of intestinal digestion depends upon the normal
performance of all the preceding stages of digestion.Perfect
insalivation, mastication, and gastric digestion are necessary to a
proper action of the intestinal juices.The first rule of treatment in
the chronic form is to examine into the condition of the mouth and
teeth--to insist upon a slow and thorough mastication of food,
especially of starchy food.Mastication is under the control of the
individual, and he refuses to exercise this salutary means of
prevention and cure at his own risk.The habit of chewing on both sides
should be cultivated.All habits which waste and weaken the saliva
should be given up, as smoking, chewing, and needless expectoration.Where the teeth are imperfect they should be attended to; false teeth
should replace absent ones.All means should be used for improving
gastric digestion: complete solution of food here means easier work for
the intestine, and sometimes the cure of intestinal indigestion by
removal of its cause.The rules which more directly bear upon the
subject of intestinal dyspepsia are these: All the causes which have
acted to bring about the disease should be removed.A change from a hot
climate to a cooler and dry one will sometimes have an immediate good
effect.Especially is this the case if travel is combined with change
of scene.The substitution of exercise for inertia, of fresh for
confined air, and the abandoning of occupations and habits of dress
which hinder the freedom of movement of the abdominal muscles are of
the highest importance.The patient should be made to cultivate
pleasure instead of work if his mind has been overtaxed in his
profession or business.Relaxation of the strained energies is
indispensable to recovery.This rule is as applicable to
school-children as it is to the overworked adult, man or woman.The
benefits of travel, with change of scene and air, cannot be
overestimated.Pedestrian tours in the mountains for young men, a trip
to Europe for men and women in middle life, will secure the best
results.For men who work much with their brains nothing is more
conducive to aiding intestinal digestion than manual labor in the
garden or workshop as a recreation.Exercise on horseback is
pleasurable and improves a sluggish abdominal circulation.Rowing is
good for younger men if it is confined to the field of pleasure, and is
not made a task.For very feeble persons, especially for women, massage
serves the purpose of exercise.The Swedish movement cure expands the
thorax and abdomen, hastens the circulation, and quickens all the
functions of nutrition and secretion.A course of treatment would be incomplete without suggestions as to
bathing.Life at the seashore would be of little service without the
daily plunge in the surf.Still salt-water bathing is better for
children and {633} delicate women.The reaction should be thorough to
secure the best results.It is much to be regretted that hydrotherapy
is not available and is not made use of more generally.A well-managed
establishment where appropriate regimen and good and sufficient food
could be combined with the renewal of the tissues by bathing would be
of great advantage in all forms of indigestion.Nearly all of the
benefit derived from the Hot Springs of Arkansas in chronic cachectic
diseases follows upon the immediate improvement of the digestion and
nutrition.The Warm and Hot Springs of Virginia have an equally good
effect upon torpid abdominal functions.The Russian bath, the very hot
bath, the cold plunge, the cold douche to the back or abdomen, and the
cold pack to the abdomen, are means which may be employed at home for
inducing a revolution ending in reform in the state of the digestive
organs.Irregularity in the hours of eating is of so much injury that rules
must be given to enforce uniform habits.Instead of the light breakfast
and heavy dinner, a good breakfast, a midday dinner, and a light tea
are to be preferred.It is of much value to regulate the appetite
according to the needs of the body and to avoid excess in everything.In this disease eating too little or starvation to a moderate degree
gives that rest to the intestine which is necessary to its restoration
to health.The selection of the food should not be left to the patient; the
dietary should be chosen for him with a view to lessening intestinal
labor.In general terms, this should consist of a moderate amount of
albuminoid food of the most digestible kind, and of farinaceous food
and fats in an acceptable and digestible form.In other words, as the
intestine digests proteids, starch, and fats, no exclusive diet can be
devised which will secure a perfect result.In each case the
examination of the stools and experience with different articles of
diet must be made the means for determining upon a suitable regimen.The exclusive milk diet is the best starting-point in feeding a patient
suffering from acute or chronic indigestion.In addition to the fact
that milk has all the elements of a perfect food, it contains sugar and
fat in the most favorable condition for absorption; the casein of milk
alone requires transformation into peptone.The pancreatic juice has
the greatest activity in its effect upon milk, as is easily
demonstrated by the artificial digestion of milk by pancreatic extract.In milk, therefore, we find a most easily digestible and most highly
nutritious food for such cases.Instead of milk with cream, skimmed
milk will be found sometimes to serve better the purpose of an
exclusive diet, because it has less fat and because larger quantities
can be taken without distaste or a sense of repletion.Koumiss may be
added to the milk diet; it is digestible, palatable, and nutritious.The peculiar and very active diastatic ferment of pancreatic juice
converts starch into sugar very readily.Farinaceous articles of diet
can be added to milk with advantage.Digestion takes place more slowly
and more thoroughly in consequence, and an additional article of
nutriment is obtained.Thus, milk can be diluted with a thick gruel of
barley or oatmeal, or some of the best of the various artificial foods
can be stirred in.To the milk diet may be added animal broths or soups
prepared with vegetables, animal jellies, or some of the ready-prepared
beef-essences.They may not in themselves be highly nutritious, but
they contain at least {634} the salts of meat, and act as stimulants to
the appetite and to the secreting glands.Such a rigid diet cannot be kept up for a very long time without
change; the appetite craves variety.Therefore solid albuminoid food in
small quantity may be added to milk and farinaceous diet.Sweetbread
boiled in milk, without dressing of any kind, is well suited for a
beginning of animal diet.Oysters for some palates make an agreeable
variety without putting much strain upon the digestive powers.They
should be eaten uncooked, as cooking in any way renders them less
digestible, and for greater precaution the hard part, or the adductor
muscle which serves to keep the two shells together, should be removed.Fish boiled or plainly cooked and eaten without sauce is very easily
digested.White-fleshed fish which has but little fat incorporated with
the muscle-fibre is to be preferred.The patient may have eggs uncooked
or slightly boiled, but one to two daily will be as much as he can well
digest.The meat of poultry and game, especially that from the wings
and breast, may be given even in a very feeble state of the digestive
organs.When a more solid or satisfying diet is craved the patient may
have beef or mutton cooked rare.Tripe and rabbit are suitable to some
cases.Bread, one day old and made light and porous, need not be denied the
patient.To many, well-made biscuits or
crackers are agreeable.Vegetables should be given in small quantities, as the intestine is
almost solely the seat of their digestion, and excess will tax too much
a function which should be allowed as much rest as possible.The green
vegetables contain less starch, and are therefore to be preferred.Lettuce, cabbage, kale, spinach, and celery come under this class, but
even these are to be given to patients under treatment in moderation,
with the intention of pleasing the palate rather than for purposes of
nutrition.Macaroni and rice are easily digested.Fruit contains very little nitrogenous matter and much water, and
therefore has but little nutritive value, but it may be given to
relieve the tedium of a restricted diet of milk or broths.Grapes,
oranges, figs, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and peaches are
the most digestible.Fruit-juices, especially if acid and fresh, are unobjectionable.Coffee
should not be allowed; its effect upon the nervous system is sufficient
objection to its use.Tea can be given diluted largely with milk;
cocoa, racahout, and broma are nutrient and make pleasant drinks.Sugar
need not be excluded if used sparingly, and butter and oil in
moderation may be permitted.If the stomach is not disturbed thereby, wine may be taken with food to
excite appetite.But except in the case of those who have always taken
it, and cannot do without it, it is better to dispense with alcohol
altogether.A red wine well diluted with water is a pleasant addition
to the meal.Old wine is to be preferred to new, as being softer and
less alcoholic.Good pure American wine from California or Virginia
will answer the purpose when reliable French wine cannot be secured.The value of mineral waters in the treatment of indigestion is great,
but without proper dietetic regimen they can accomplish but little.The
good results following a visit to Saratoga, Bedford, or other
watering-place are due to other causes than the waters.In combination,
however, {635} with the advantages of change of scene, air, good hours,
and a simple diet the mineral waters aid in bringing about a cure.They
are especially useful in men who drink too little water at home, in
gouty and plethoric subjects, and in states of acid stomach digestion
and chronic constipation.The alkaline and saline waters are the best,
the former containing a notable proportion of the carbonate or
bicarbonate of sodium, potassium, or lithium--the latter having neutral
salts in considerable quantity.The articles of food to be avoided are pastry, cheese, much butter or
fat, meat richly dressed or over-cooked, pork, veal, lobsters, crabs,
vegetable matter in excess, very cold or very hot fluids or solids.All of the methods so far described are designed to accelerate the
circulation in the abdominal organs and in the tissues generally, to
quicken the secretory and nutritive processes, and to give to the
intestinal secretions the foods which they can most readily digest.In
the event of such means failing to accomplish the desired end, is there
any direct stimulus which can be brought to bear on the intestinal
glands concerned in digestion?The pancreas being the most active and
most important of these, it would be desirable to have some agent which
could excite its gland-structure to greater activity.Sulphuric ether
has been found to have this effect; it may be given before meals.The
salivary secretion begins pancreatic digestion (the digestion of
starch), and therefore its outflow should be stimulated at the same
time; but thorough mastication does this usually without need of
further aid.When all plans fail to secure a thorough digestion in the intestine,
and unaltered food and fat are passed, while the patient grows thinner
and feebler daily, artificially-digested food may be given.The
intestine is thus relieved of labor, and time is given for a
restoration of activity by rest and an improved tone of all the tissues
and organs.Rice, bread, baked flour, potatoes, or barley may be given
in combination with malt extract, which converts starch into
grape-sugar and dextrin.As pancreatic juice acts both upon proteids and starch, an extract of
the pancreas has a more general application than an extract of the
stomach--pepsin.Roberts of Manchester has given full directions for
the method of digesting food by pancreatic extract.Beef, milk, and the
farinacea may be digested, the albuminoid substances being changed into
peptones, the starchy matters into dextrin and sugar, capable of being
absorbed readily with but little or no further alteration in the
digestive tract.[18] Pancreatic emulsion (Dobell) is another method of
giving fat emulsified.[Footnote 18: Fresh pancreatic extract is made by cutting into small
pieces the pancreas of the pig (which is the best), the ox, or sheep.The pancreas of the calf yields an extract which acts only on
albuminous substances, but not on starchy matters.The divided pieces
of the pancreas, well freed from fat, are put in a well-corked,
wide-mouthed bottle with four times their weight of dilute alcohol (one
part of rectified spirit to three parts of water).The mixture should
be agitated once daily: at the end of a week the mixture is filtered
through paper until it is clear.A well-made liquid extract of pancreas
is made and sold by Metcalfe of Boston, and a solid extract by
Fairchild Bros.No doubt improvements will be
made in the processes of manufacture of these extracts, and better
results will in time be obtained from their use.]A less successful way of gaining the same object is by administering
the pancreatic extract internally.The difficulty lies in conveying the
extract (the ferment of which is destroyed by the acid gastric juice)
through the stomach in safety.This chemical danger is thought to be
obviated by giving the extract one to two hours after eating with a
{636} protecting guard of an alkali, the bicarbonate of sodium; but the
mechanical difficulty of securing direct transit through the stomach to
the intestine early enough and in quantity enough to digest the
duodenal contents is as great as the chemical obstacle.It is very
doubtful whether this method of use can be of any real service.In those cases in which the form of indigestion is due to, or is
associated with, a deficient hepatic secretion--a condition indicated
by offensive and light- stools and other symptoms--it is
advisable to stimulate the liver to increased secretion.It is probable
that the same remedies which excite a flow of bile do at the same time
stimulate the pancreas.The best of these are euonymin, sanguinarin,
iridin, ipecacuanha, colocynth, jalap, podophyllin, sodium sulphate,
and potassium sulphate.Sodium benzoate, ammonium benzoate, and the
salicylate of sodium are also powerful hepatic stimulants.As one of
the purposes of the bile is to create the alkaline medium necessary for
pancreatic digestion, the administration of an alkaline[19] solution in
full doses, as in the form of mineral water, when gastric digestion is
finished, may make amends for the lack of bile.A combination of an
antiseptic and the alkali may to some extent supply the deficiency
still better, as the bile is the antiseptic of the intestinal canal.[Footnote 19: The waters of Ems, Vichy (Grande Ville or Hopital
Springs), Vals, or Bilin may be used for this purpose.]Atony of the intestinal wall leads to flatulence, colics, and
constipation, and would be a cause of indigestion if none other
existed.It is to be treated by the general rules already given, by
electrical stimulation of the abdominal muscles with the faradic
current, or by the effort to stimulate the intestinal wall more
effectively with the galvanic current.Strychnia in small doses should
be given for some time.In women of relaxed muscular fibre with
enlarged abdomens an elastic belt may be worn with advantage.After the special aids to the parts concerned in digestion, tonics are
called for to combat the general want of tone and anaemia.The
saccharated iron, the carbonate, potassio-tartrate, lactate,
pyrophosphate, or the ferrum redactum may be given.The syrup of the
iodide of iron is the best form for children.The bitter tonics are
inadvisable except for loss of appetite in cases where the stomach is
not disordered.Quinia is available in a large number of cases in which
malarial influence plays a part.Strychnia is a good general tonic, and
may be prescribed combined with mineral acids, particularly with the
dilute hydrochloric acid.The special symptoms which call for treatment are flatulence, abdominal
pains, and constipation.All the remedies already described are
directed toward their relief.But sometimes they appear in so
exaggerated a form as to need immediate attention.The many remedies
for colic and tympanitic distension which have the property of
relieving spasm and absorbing gas find application in these conditions.Constipation is not to be treated by laxatives if it can be avoided.But the bitter waters, Friedrichshall, Pullna, Hunyadi Janos, and
Rakoczy, by exciting bile outflow, are sometimes of undoubted curative
value.The form of dyspepsia called strumous, as it occurs in children of
anaemic appearance with dry skin covered with minute scales, and with
bad breath and light ill-smelling stools, demands a very thorough and
{637} persevering treatment.The advantages of climate must be
sought--seashore in summer with bathing, dry and moderately warm air in
winter.Outdoor life in the sun, with active exercise, is to be had at
the expense of education within-doors.Study is not good for children
of this class except when health is made paramount to it.Cod-liver
oil, either pure, in phosphatic emulsion, or in the pancreatic
emulsion, is a necessity.Malt extract with the hypophosphites is
beneficial.The food must be carefully selected, and the child educated
to a varied diet, including fats.The skin should be anointed daily
with cocoanut oil, olive, cottonseed oil, or cod-liver oil.{638}

CONSTIPATION.BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.SYNONYMS.--Costiveness, Fecal retention, Fecal accumulation, Alvine
obstruction, Obstipation._Ger._ Koprostase, Stuhlverstopfung,
Hartleibigkeit, Kothstanung._Fr._ Constipation, Paresse du ventre,
Echauffement.Older synonyms: Constipatio vel
obstipatio alvi; Alvus tarda, dura, adstricta; Tarda alvi dejectio;
Obstipatio alvarina; Stypsis; Coprostasis (Good).NATURE AND DEFINITION.--The act of defecation is almost wholly due to
the working of an involuntary mechanism which may be set in play by the
will, and is in part dominated by it, but which is frequently
independent and uncontrolled by volition.Deep inspiration, closure of
the glottis, downward pressure of the diaphragm, and contraction of the
abdominal muscles are accessory, but not essential, to the expulsion of
feces from the rectum.In certain persons, and occasionally in all
persons, especially in diseases where the fecal mass is in a semi-fluid
or fluid form, the strongest effort of the will cannot resist the
expulsive contractions of the rectal muscle.The sphincter is kept in a
state of tonic contraction by a nervous centre situated in the lumbar
portion of the spinal cord.The fecal mass, supported by the bladder
and the rectum, does not at first touch the sphincter; the rectum is
usually empty; but when the column has been well driven into the rectum
peristaltic action is excited in the rectal walls and the sphincter is
firmly pressed upon.The lumbar sphincter centre is now inhibited, and
the ring of muscle opens, the accessory and voluntary muscles contract,
and the expulsive act is completed.In the well-ordered and healthy
individual the rectal walls and the sphincter do not receive the
maximum of irritation from pressure of the advancing column but once in
twenty-four hours.The habit of having one movement in each day is, it
may be believed, in accordance with the natural and physiological
demand, although both the number and the hours of evacuating are fixed
to a great extent by education.The habit once established, the
mechanism of expulsion recurs at the same hour and entirely without the
direction of the will.If the desire be resisted, it will be most apt
not to return until the same hour on the next day.Defecation depends for its normal character upon the healthy
functioning of the organism, but especially upon the normal processes
of digestion.The character of the rectal contents as to composition
and consistence, and the time of the arrival of the mass at the
sphincter, are {639} regulated by the taking of food at stated hours
and by its normal digestion and absorption.Unaltered or partly-changed
remains of the ingesta pass down the bowel, mingling with the secretion
from the intestinal glands and with mucus and epithelium.As this mass
passes into and through the colon, being propelled by regular
peristaltic waves, it acquires odor from the development of a substance
which is a final product of the putrefaction of albumen.[1] Gradually
the more fluid elements are absorbed, and in the descending colon a
less fluid or semi-solid consistence of the feces is reached.A healthy
digestion and assimilation, with active and regular contractile
movements of the muscular walls of the small and large intestines, are
essential to normal defecation.[Footnote 1: Ewald, _Lectures on Digestion_, New York, 1881, p.Constipation may be defined to be that condition in which there is a
prolonged retention of the feces or in which they are habitually
expelled with difficulty or in insufficient quantity.[2] While there
are individual peculiarities due to habit or nature, the custom with
most persons of having one movement in the twenty-four hours would
cause any longer retention of the rectal contents to be considered
constipation.The limits between health and disease are not well
defined, and a failure to evacuate the bowels for several days need not
be considered pathological nor require medical interference.In persons
otherwise in good health such an occurrence due to neglect, change of
habit or diet, as in travelling, would cause no interruption to health
or comfort.Nature brings relief sooner or later and re-establishes
order and regularity.In many cases constipation is a primary disease
and the cause of many secondary disturbances, but it is often the
effect or the symptom of various acute and chronic diseases.[Footnote 2: Cases of constipation due to mechanical obstruction from
changes in the wall of the intestine or to exterior pressure will not
be considered in this article.]In long-continued constipation the intestinal contents are so retarded
in their progression along the canal that they undergo a too early and
too complete absorption of their fluid portion.In time there are an
accumulation and impaction of dry fecal masses in the rectum, sigmoid
flexure, descending transverse colon, or caecum.An obstacle is thus
created which may ultimately close the tube entirely and cause
intestinal obstruction.It
is the effect of loss of peristaltic force and of a diminution of
sensibility in the lower bowel, and is associated with general
functional inactivity and with muscular degeneration and obesity.Infants are more subject to constipation than children of one year and
over.In many instances this is due to artificial feeding with cow's
milk, condensed milk, and the patent foods so largely used, or with any
diet unsuited to the digestive organs.Imperfect digestion of casein or
other food, the filling of the bowel with a dry mass difficult to
propel, and the consequent catarrhal state of the mucous membrane, are
causes of both constipation and diarrhoea.Feeble, delicate children
with imperfect muscular development, and children born rachitic,
scrofulous, or syphilitic, are generally constipated.Women are prone to constipation much more than men.False modesty,
which imposes restraint upon young girls, and their ignorance {640} of
the necessity of regularity, their habits of indoor life, and avoidance
of exercise, are largely the causes of this.But the anatomical
structure and physiological life of the woman offer another
explanation.At every menstrual period the uterus enlarges and
exercises a greater compression upon the rectum.A tender and enlarged
ovary (and at the menstrual epoch the ovary is always tender and
enlarged) exercises an inhibiting action upon the muscles which bring
the feces in contact with it in their downward passage.In the married
woman recurring pregnancies lead to the habit of constipation from the
long-continued pressure upon the colon, sigmoid flexure, and rectum,
from the extreme stretching of the abdominal muscles, and from the
paralyzing effect of compression during labor.The relaxed condition of
the pelvic and abdominal organs after labor offers no resistance to the
distension of the rectum and sigmoid flexure.The cessation of the
catamenia is accompanied with constipation, nervousness, and a feeling
of ill-defined apprehension when the bowels are moved, or abdominal
pains deter many persons, chiefly women, from habits of regularity.All
uterine and ovarian derangements by mechanical or reflex means bring
about the same result.Chlorosis and anaemia in girls are almost
invariably associated with constipation.Hereditary influence shows itself very markedly in the tendency to
constipation which is seen in many members of the same family.This is
probably more often apparent than real, and is the result of neglect of
the proper attention to the wants of children and of the perpetuation
of vicious habits of taking purgatives.The habits of life and the occupation of the individual have much to
do with the causation of constipation.Those who lead active outdoor
lives are generally regular in their daily movements, but persons of
sedentary pursuits or who work in constrained attitudes--lawyers,
clerks, tailors, shoemakers, and seamstresses--are predisposed to
constipation.Intellectual work, not only from the muscular inactivity
which it entails, but from the diversion of energy to the
nerve-centres, develops the constipated habit as well as indigestion.Men who are overworked in business, employes in banks, government
offices, shops, etc., bring on the habit from the hurry incident to
their occupations.Luxurious and enervating habits of life, over-eating
and sloth, with the over-indulgence in alcohol and tobacco, have the
same effect.All the influences which deteriorate health, such as bad
ventilation and over-heating of rooms, foul air, want of cleanliness of
the person, indigestible food, imperfect mastication, tight-lacing in
women, compression of the abdominal organs in men, can be said to share
in bringing it about.Servants, especially women, are constipated more
frequently than their masters.This is due to ignorance and neglect,
and sometimes to excessive tea-drinking and irregularity in eating.Neglect to establish or continue a habit of daily regularity in
defecation leads to the accumulation in the rectum of masses of feces.Resisting the desire to empty the bowel interrupts the necessary reflex
acts, and finally the muscular excitability and response to the
presence of feces are entirely wanting.The continued contact of fecal
matter with the mucous membrane wears out its susceptibility; the
over-distension of the rectum enfeebles the power of its muscular wall,
as is the case when all hollow muscular organs--stomach, heart,
bladder--are overstretched.Thus a {641} neglect to answer the demand
for a daily movement and the failure to completely empty the rectum
will gradually develop constipation in a person who has before been
perfectly well regulated.In childhood failure to teach and to insist
upon good habits is the cause of much of the trouble of after-life.Acute and chronic diseases of the brain and spinal cord bring about
constipation.Meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis, senile dementia
and softening, have it as a symptom at some time or other.In
encephalitis and myelitis there is an interruption of motor
nerve-currents.In meningitis and tetanus the muscular walls of the
bowel and the abdominal muscles are in a state of tonic contraction.The use of aperients is an important agent in developing the
constipated habit by over-stimulating and wearing out muscular
activity.The idea that a daily movement is a necessity, and that an
occasional purgative is useful in relieving the system of morbid matter
which would otherwise induce disease, is the chief source of this
hurtful custom.The traditional meaning attached to the term
biliousness implied the resort to cathartics for its relief, and it is
much to be regretted that with our more advanced knowledge the effort
should be made to revive the use of this term, which was wellnigh
abandoned.More ignorance and erroneous treatment has hung upon the
theory of biliousness than upon any other doctrine of medicine within
the past thirty years: it is well for physicians to condemn it and to
resist its reintroduction into scientific phraseology.[3] If the term
bilious as applied to diseases were abandoned, much good would come of
it.The general use of purgative mineral waters has added to this evil.Among the better classes these waters play the same part as the liver
regulators and vegetable pills do among laborers and servant-maids.Both gratify the innate love for self-medication by a resort to
cathartics for the slightest ailment.At first the injurious effects
are not apparent, but in time the reflex function is not brought into
activity except by artificial aids.The intestinal and rectal muscles
must be whipped into action, their normal contractile power being lost.[Footnote 3: For an excellent and dispassionate statement of the
reasons for abandoning the theory of the influences of bile as a cause
of disease, and the use of the term bilious, consult _The Bile,
Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, by J. Wickham Legg, chaps.The Hippocratic and Galenical belief has been transmitted with
but little alteration through Stoll, Andrie, Abernethy, and Copland to
the writers of to-day on biliousness.]Certain vegetable and mineral substances taken either intentionally
or by accident constipate the bowels.Chief among these stand opium and
its preparations.All opium-eaters are constipated.Lead which is
accidentally taken into the system by workers in metals, painters, etc.The use of tobacco in
excess has the effect of deranging digestion and causing constipation
in many persons, but this result is occasional only.Chronic diseases of the lungs and heart, by enfeebling the muscular
movements which take part in defecation, as well as by the general
feebleness and the chronic intestinal catarrh and indigestion which
they create, are causes of constipation.Chronic diseases of the liver,
especially cirrhosis, are also causes.Constipation accompanies
obesity, for in very fat persons the abdominal walls have but little
power of contraction; the {642} muscle-layer is thin and flaccid.There
is also in such persons in advanced life an accumulation of fat in the
mesentery and around the colon.The muscle of the bowel is in a state
of fatty degeneration, and atony and dilatation of the gut follow.Painful affections about the rectum and anus deter persons from
yielding to the desire for defecation.Fissure of the anus is the
principal one of these, but fistula, hemorrhoids, and local eczema have
a similar influence.A simple rigidity or spasmodic stricture of the
anal sphincter creates constipation.[4]

[Footnote 4: Kunemann, _De la Constipation compliques de Contraction du
Sphincter anal, et de son Traitement par la Dilatation de l'Anus_,
Paris, 1851.]Constipation is a symptom in chronic cachexiae and wasting
diseases, in the convalescence of acute exhausting illness, as typhoid
fever and pneumonia, or in persons bedridden from any cause.Defective
nutrition and degeneration of the muscle-fibre of the intestine explain
these cases.In some of them, with improved nutrition, regeneration
takes place with a return of contractility.Disorders of the digestive system have constipation as a
consequence and a symptom.The reflex sympathy between the movements of
the stomach and of the intestines brings this about in gastric
diseases.[5] It occurs in gastric cancer and ulcer, in acute and
chronic gastritis, in dilatation of the stomach, and in pyloric
stricture.The small amount of ingesta entering the duodenum in these
diseases diminishes the bulk of fecal matter.In acute intestinal
catarrh diarrhoea is the rule, but the bowels may be constipated in
intense inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membrane, as is often
the case in typhoid fever.In chronic intestinal catarrh constipation
is more common in the mild forms than diarrhoea.The thickening and
irritation of the mucous membrane lead to a diminution of reflex
excitability and loss of elasticity and contractility in the muscular
coat.Hence, except in cases where the inflammation is low down or
where ulcers have formed, constipation is a more frequent symptom than
diarrhoea.The alteration in the quantity and character of the
intestinal secretions in chronic catarrh is stated to be an important
element.Mucus, which is the chief product
of this condition, leads to indigestion and fermentation of the
intestinal contents and to increased irritation of the mucous membrane.The evolved gas distends the bowel and weakens its contractile power.The fecal mass when it reaches the rectum has an excess of mucus within
it or around it which makes its expulsion more difficult.But the
diminution or absence of bile does not constipate.In simple jaundice
diarrhoea is not uncommon, and an excess of bile does not of necessity
cause diarrhoea.[6]

[Footnote 5: Leube, in _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, vol.[Footnote 6: Legg, _op.The effects of the modifications of the pancreatic secretion are not
well known.Pancreatitis is attended by constipation.Fatty diarrhoea
is believed to follow occlusion of the pancreatic duct by pancreatic
calculi and chronic catarrh of the duct.Peristalsis is lost in
peritonitis from the muscular coat being infiltrated with serum and
paralyzed, but tuberculous peritonitis is frequently accompanied by
diarrhoea.Loss of fluids by abundant perspiration, by diuresis, diabetes and
lactation, increases the dryness of the bowel contents and hinders free
{643} evacuations.This is observed as a result of the arrival in a
tropical climate and in very hot weather in any climate.The profuse
sweats accompanying phthisis, acute rheumatism, intermittent fever, and
unusual exercise cause constipation.Another explanation which applies
to this has been offered by Good and Eberle, who ascribe constipation
to the excessive action of the absorbents in the small intestine, by
which the fluid portion is too rapidly and too thoroughly removed.[7]
Exercise by promoting activity of the functions in general may induce
constipation in this way.In spermatorrhoea the stools are infrequent.An insufficient amount of water taken with food is another cause.[Footnote 7: Dick, _Braithwaite's Retrospect_, xvii.Food which has but little waste to be got rid of--as milk or
beef--leaves a small residuum to be propelled along the intestine, and
therefore in one sense is constipating.Insufficient food acts in the
same way.An indigestible diet in excess, especially vegetable food, a
large part of which is insoluble, constipates by filling the bowel with
matter which cannot be got rid of, and chronic catarrh results.The
stones and seeds of fruits, as cherry- and plum-stones, raspberry- and
currant-seeds, husks of corn and oats, produce acute or chronic
constipation with serious symptoms.Intestinal worms (generally
lumbricoids) when in large numbers cause obstruction of the bowel;[8]
and various foreign substances taken by caprice or to take the place of
food have produced the same result: among these stick cinnamon,[9]
sawdust,[10] and clay (among the clay-eaters of the South) have been
mentioned.Magnesia, insoluble pills, and other medicines sometimes
form concretions in the bowel.Enteroliths and accidental concretions
form in the intestinal canal and are sources of obstruction.Any
foreign body is a nucleus around which concentric layers of phosphate
of lime are deposited, and thus a hard calculus is formed.Gall-stones
may pass into the canal and there accumulate in such numbers as to
interfere with the passage of the fecal matter.[Footnote 8: Copland, _Medical Repository_, vol.[Footnote 9: Ware, _Boston Med.and Surgical Journal_, 1858, vol.[Footnote 10: Bonney, _ibid._, 1859, vol.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--In cases where constipation has lasted many
years no alteration of the parts involved may be found.When lesions do
occur the pathological anatomy includes changes in the position,[11]
calibre, and in the walls and contents of the intestines.The most
common displacement is that of the transverse colon, which is depressed
in its centre; the acute angle of the descending part may reach as far
down as the hypogastrium.The caecum sometimes lies in the centre of
the abdomen.Dislocations of the intestines are congenital, due to
anomalies of intra-uterine development, in which case they become
causes of death in newly-born children from obstruction, or if
insufficient to cause death they establish habitual and incurable
constipation; or constipation may bring about displacement by the
greater weight of a portion of the bowel constantly loaded with fecal
matter.[Footnote 11: Votsch, _Koprostase_, Erlangen, 1874.]The sigmoid flexure is usually the seat of the greatest dilatation; its
expansion may be a cause or a consequence of constipation.[12] It may
reach a maximum of distension when it fills the entire abdominal
cavity, compressing all the abdominal organs and pushing the stomach,
liver, {644} and intestines into the thorax.In a case of this kind the
circumference of the dilated part was twenty-seven inches.[13] The
descending colon may be distended with the sigmoid flexure, or the
whole colon may be dilated from the upper part of the rectum to the
caecum;[14] the same thing happens rarely in the small intestine.In
one case, in which there was an accumulation of feces in the sigmoid
flexure, the large intestine presented itself as two immense cylinders
lying side by side, extending from the epigastrium to the pelvis.[15]
Each was about five and a half inches in diameter, and together they
filled the abdominal cavity.The circumference of the stretched colon
varies from ten to thirty inches.Pouches forming little rounded tumors
are seen on the outer surface of the colon; they are sometimes hernial
protrusions of the mucous membrane through the muscular coat (Wilks and
Moxon), or if large they are dilatations of the pouches of the
colon.[16]

[Footnote 12: Trastour, "De la Dilatation passive de l'Iliaque, et de
ses consequences," _Journal de Med.de l'Ouest_, 1878-79, tome xii.[Footnote 13: Dupleix, _Le Progres medicale_, Paris, 1877, tome v. p.[Footnote 14: Peacock, "Fatal Constipation, with Excessive Dilatation
of the Colon," _Tr.[Footnote 15: Lewitt, _Chicago Med.[Footnote 16: Gay, "Sacculated Colon, Prolonged Constipation," _Tr.But little weight can be
attached to this anomaly, as there is a difference in the length of the
colon in different nations and individuals, depending upon the
character of the food, being longer in those who eat largely of
vegetable food.[17]

[Footnote 17: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, vol.The mucous membrane is normal or hyperaemic, or is in various stages of
chronic catarrh.Proctitis may exist with follicular ulcers; ulcers
form in the caecum, sigmoid flexure, and in the bends of the colon;
perforations and peritonitis rarely occur.Chronic peritonitis has
resulted from the stretching of the bowel from retained and hardened
feces; adhesions may form which ultimately cause death by obstructing
the canal.The walls of the intestines are in long-standing cases much
thinned.There are many reasons to believe that fatty degeneration of
the smooth muscular fibre takes place, in consequence of which it loses
its contractile power and atrophies.This lesion is most common in
advanced life, and accompanies fatty accumulation and degeneration
elsewhere.Its results would be constipation, distension of the bowel
with gas, and sometimes symptoms of intestinal obstruction.[18] A
thinned and dilated bowel may easily be lacerated under unusual
stimulation, as from a purgative.In a case recently seen by the writer
such an accident, rupture of the colon and death from peritonitis,
occurred from the effects of an active purge taken to bring on
abortion.Hypertrophy of the wall, especially of the muscular coat,
coexists with dilatation, and is most common in the upper part of the
rectum and sigmoid flexure.It is caused by overwork in expelling fecal
accumulations.The walls never become as much thickened as in
constipation from organic stricture.[Footnote 18: Cases are recorded of death with symptoms of intestinal
obstruction in which no lesion was found beyond a dilated colon; as,
for example, in _British Medical Journal_, April, 1879, p.Collections of fecal matter may be found in any portion of the colon,
but more frequently in the rectum, sigmoid flexure, descending or {645}
transverse colon, or caecum.They lie within the intestinal tube,
partly or wholly occluding it, or within lateral pouches, forming
tumors which are sometimes quite large.In this last form there is no
obstacle to the free passage of feces along the canal.Fecal
accumulations occur as small round, oval, or irregularly-shaped lumps
(scybalae), and are often covered with layers of transparent semi-fluid
mucus, puriform mucus, or mucus in filaments.The small concretions
vary in density; they may be so hard as to resist the knife, and may be
mistaken for gall-stones; larger masses, semi-solid or solid, are most
commonly seen in the rectum and sigmoid flexure.Here the collection
may reach an immense size.In one case fifteen quarts of semi-solid,
greenish- fecal matter were removed at the autopsy.[19] In two
other cases the weight of the feces found in the bowel was thirteen and
a half[20] and twenty-six pounds[21] respectively.The whole colon from
the anus to the caecum may be filled with such a mass, as in a case
mentioned by Bristowe, where the colon "was completely full of
semi-solid olive-green  feces.The small intestines were also
considerably distended,... and were filled throughout with semi-fluid
olive-green contents."[22]
