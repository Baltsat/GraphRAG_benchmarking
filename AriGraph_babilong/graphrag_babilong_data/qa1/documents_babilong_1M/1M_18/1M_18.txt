Let courtiers and sycophants flatter
power and desert misfortune; I will neither do the one nor the other.""And if you are determined to act what my feeble judgment must still term
rashly, why give yourself the pain of this untimely meeting?""Were it not enough to answer," said Lord Evandale, "that, ere rushing on
battle, I wished to bid adieu to my betrothed bride?Surely it is judging
coldly of my feelings, and showing too plainly the indifference of your
own, to question my motive for a request so natural.""But why in this place, my lord," said Edith; "and why with such peculiar
circumstances of mystery?""Because," he replied, putting a letter into her hand, "I have yet
another request, which I dare hardly proffer, even when prefaced by these
credentials."In haste and terror, Edith glanced over the letter, which was from her
grandmother."My dearest childe," such was its tenor in style and spelling, "I
     never more deeply regretted the reumatizm, which disqualified me
     from riding on horseback, than at this present writing, when I would
     most have wished to be where this paper will soon be, that is at
     Fairy Knowe, with my poor dear Willie's only child.But it is the
     will of God I should not be with her, which I conclude to be the
     case, as much for the pain I now suffer, as because it hath now not
     given way either to cammomile poultices or to decoxion of wild
     mustard, wherewith I have often relieved others.Therefore, I must
     tell you, by writing instead of word of mouth, that, as my young
     Lord Evandale is called to the present campaign, both by his honour
     and his duty, he hath earnestly solicited me that the bonds of holy
     matrimony be knitted before his departure to the wars between you
     and him, in implement of the indenture formerly entered into for
     that effeck, whereuntill, as I see no raisonable objexion, so I
     trust that you, who have been always a good and obedient childe,
     will not devize any which has less than raison.It is trew that the
     contrax of our house have heretofore been celebrated in a manner
     more befitting our Rank, and not in private, and with few witnesses,
     as a thing done in a corner.But it has been Heaven's own free will,
     as well as those of the kingdom where we live, to take away from us
     our estate, and from the King his throne.Yet I trust He will yet
     restore the rightful heir to the throne, and turn his heart to the
     true Protestant Episcopal faith, which I have the better right to
     expect to see even with my old eyes, as I have beheld the royal
     family when they were struggling as sorely with masterful usurpers
     and rebels as they are now; that is to say, when his most sacred
     Majesty, Charles the Second of happy memory, honoured our poor house
     of Tillietudlem by taking his _disjune_ therein," etc., etc., etc.We will not abuse the reader's patience by quoting more of Lady
Margaret's prolix epistle.Suffice it to say that it closed by laying her
commands on her grandchild to consent to the solemnization of her
marriage without loss of time."I never thought till this instant," said Edith, dropping the letter from
her hand, "that Lord Evandale would have acted ungenerously.""And how can you apply such a
term to my desire to call you mine, ere I part from you, perhaps for
ever?""Lord Evandale ought to have remembered," said Edith, "that when his
perseverance, and, I must add, a due sense of his merit and of the
obligations we owed him, wrung from me a slow consent that I would one
day comply with his wishes, I made it my condition that I should not be
pressed to a hasty accomplishment of my promise; and now he avails
himself of his interest with my only remaining relative to hurry me with
precipitate and even indelicate importunity.There is more selfishness
than generosity, my lord, in such eager and urgent solicitation."Lord Evandale, evidently much hurt, took two or three turns through the
apartment ere he replied to this accusation; at length he spoke: "I
should have escaped this painful charge, durst I at once have mentioned
to Miss Bellendon my principal reason for urging this request.It is one
which she will probably despise on her own account, but which ought to
weigh with her for the sake of Lady Margaret.My death in battle must
give my whole estate to my heirs of entail; my forfeiture as a traitor,
by the usurping Government, may vest it in the Prince of Orange or some
Dutch favourite.In either case, my venerable friend and betrothed bride
must remain unprotected and in poverty.Vested with the rights and
provisions of Lady Evandale, Edith will find, in the power of supporting
her aged parent, some consolation for having condescended to share the
titles and fortunes of one who does not pretend to be worthy of her."Edith was struck dumb by an argument which she had not expected, and was
compelled to acknowledge that Lord Evandale's suit was urged with
delicacy as well as with consideration."And yet," she said, "such is the waywardness with which my heart reverts
to former times that I cannot," she burst into tears, "suppress a degree
of ominous reluctance at fulfilling my engagement upon such a brief
summons.""We have already fully considered this painful subject," said Lord
Evandale; "and I hoped, my dear Edith, your own inquiries, as well as
mine, had fully convinced you that these regrets were fruitless."said Edith, with a deep sigh, which, as if by an
unexpected echo, was repeated from the adjoining apartment.Miss
Bellenden started at the sound, and scarcely composed herself upon Lord
Evandale's assurances that she had heard but the echo of her own
respiration."It sounded strangely distinct," she said, "and almost ominous; but my
feelings are so harassed that the slightest trifle agitates them."Lord Evandale eagerly attempted to soothe her alarm, and reconcile her to
a measure which, however hasty, appeared to him the only means by which
he could secure her independence.He urged his claim in virtue of the
contract, her grandmother's wish and command, the propriety of insuring
her comfort and independence, and touched lightly on his own long
attachment, which he had evinced by so many and such various services.These Edith felt the more, the less they were insisted upon; and at
length, as she had nothing to oppose to his ardour, excepting a causeless
reluctance which she herself was ashamed to oppose against so much
generosity, she was compelled to rest upon the impossibility of having
the ceremony performed upon such hasty notice, at such a time and place.But for all this Lord Evandale was prepared, and he explained, with
joyful alacrity, that the former chaplain of his regiment was in
attendance at the Lodge with a faithful domestic, once a non-commissioned
officer in the same corps; that his sister was also possessed of the
secret; and that Headrigg and his wife might be added to the list of
witnesses, if agreeable to Miss Bellenden.As to the place, he had chosen
it on very purpose.The marriage was to remain a secret, since Lord
Evandale was to depart in disguise very soon after it was solemnized,--a
circumstance which, had their union been public, must have drawn upon him
the attention of the Government, as being altogether unaccountable,
unless from his being engaged in some dangerous design.Having hastily
urged these motives and explained his arrangements, he ran, without
waiting for an answer, to summon his sister to attend his bride, while he
went in search of the other persons whose presence was necessary.When Lady Emily arrived, she found her friend in an agony of tears, of
which she was at some loss to comprehend the reason, being one of those
damsels who think there is nothing either wonderful or terrible in
matrimony, and joining with most who knew him in thinking that it could
not be rendered peculiarly alarming by Lord Evandale being the
bridegroom.Influenced by these feelings, she exhausted in succession all
the usual arguments for courage, and all the expressions of sympathy and
condolence ordinarily employed on such occasions.But when Lady Emily
beheld her future sister-in-law deaf to all those ordinary topics of
consolation; when she beheld tears follow fast and without intermission
down cheeks as pale as marble; when she felt that the hand which she
pressed in order to enforce her arguments turned cold within her grasp,
and lay, like that of a corpse, insensible and unresponsive to her
caresses, her feelings of sympathy gave way to those of hurt pride and
pettish displeasure."I must own," she said, "that I am something at a loss to understand all
this, Miss Bellenden.Months have passed since you agreed to marry my
brother, and you have postponed the fulfilment of your engagement from
one period to another, as if you had to avoid some dishonourable or
highly disagreeable connection.I think I can answer for Lord Evandale
that he will seek no woman's hand against her inclination; and, though
his sister, I may boldly say that he does not need to urge any lady
further than her inclinations carry her.You will forgive me, Miss
Bellenden; but your present distress augurs ill for my brother's future
happiness, and I must needs say that he does not merit all these
expressions of dislike and dolour, and that they seem an odd return for
an attachment which he has manifested so long, and in so many ways.""You are right, Lady Emily," said Edith, drying her eyes and endeavouring
to resume her natural manner, though still betrayed by her faltering
voice and the paleness of her cheeks,--"you are quite right; Lord
Evandale merits such usage from no one, least of all from her whom he has
honoured with his regard.But if I have given way, for the last time, to
a sudden and irresistible burst of feeling, it is my consolation, Lady
Emily, that your brother knows the cause, that I have hid nothing from
him, and that he at least is not apprehensive of finding in Edith
Bellenden a wife undeserving of his affection.But still you are right,
and I merit your censure for indulging for a moment fruitless regret and
painful remembrances.It shall be so no longer; my lot is cast with
Evandale, and with him I am resolved to bear it.Nothing shall in future
occur to excite his complaints or the resentment of his relations; no
idle recollections of other days shall intervene to prevent the zealous
and affectionate discharge of my duty; no vain illusions recall the
memory of other days--"

As she spoke these words, she slowly raised her eyes, which had before
been hidden by her hand, to the latticed window of her apartment, which
was partly open, uttered a dismal shriek, and fainted.Lady Emily turned
her eyes in the same direction, but saw only the shadow of a man, which
seemed to disappear from the window, and, terrified more by the state of
Edith than by the apparition she had herself witnessed, she uttered
shriek upon shriek for assistance.Her brother soon arrived, with the
chaplain and Jenny Dennison; but strong and vigorous remedies were
necessary ere they could recall Miss Bellenden to sense and motion.Even
then her language was wild and incoherent.[Illustration: Uttered A Dismal Shriek, And Fainted--224]


"Press me no farther," she said to Lord Evandale,--"it cannot be; Heaven
and earth, the living and the dead, have leagued themselves against this
ill-omened union.Take all I can give,--my sisterly regard, my devoted
friendship.I will love you as a sister and serve you as a bondswoman,
but never speak to me more of marriage."The astonishment of Lord Evandale may easily be conceived."Emily," he said to his sister, "this is your doing.I was accursed when
I thought of bringing you here; some of your confounded folly has driven
her mad!""On my word, Brother," answered Lady Emily, "you're sufficient to drive
all the women in Scotland mad.Because your mistress seems much disposed
to jilt you, you quarrel with your sister, who has been arguing in your
cause, and had brought her to a quiet hearing, when, all of a sudden, a
man looked in at a window, whom her crazed sensibility mistook either for
you or some one else, and has treated us gratis with an excellent tragic
scene."said Lord Evandale, in impatient displeasure."Miss Bellenden is incapable of trifling with me; and yet what else could
have--"

"Hush!said Jenny, whose interest lay particularly in shifting
further inquiry; "for Heaven's sake, my lord, speak low, for my lady
begins to recover."Edith was no sooner somewhat restored to herself than she begged, in a
feeble voice, to be left alone with Lord Evandale.All retreated,--Jenny
with her usual air of officious simplicity, Lady Emily and the chaplain
with that of awakened curiosity.No sooner had they left the apartment
than Edith beckoned Lord Evandale to sit beside her on the couch; her
next motion was to take his hand, in spite of his surprised resistance,
to her lips; her last was to sink from her seat and to clasp his knees.I must deal most
untruly by you, and break a solemn engagement.You have my friendship, my
highest regard, my most sincere gratitude; you have more,--you have my
word and my faith; but--oh, forgive me, for the fault is not mine--you
have not my love, and I cannot marry you without a sin!""You dream, my dearest Edith!"said Evandale, perplexed in the utmost
degree, "you let your imagination beguile you; this is but some delusion
of an over-sensitive mind.The person whom you preferred to me has been
long in a better world, where your unavailing regret cannot follow him,
or, if it could, would only diminish his happiness.""You are mistaken, Lord Evandale," said Edith, solemnly; "I am not a
sleep-walker or a madwoman.No, I could not have believed from any one
what I have seen.But, having seen him, I must believe mine own eyes."asked Lord Evandale, in great anxiety."Henry Morton," replied Edith, uttering these two words as if they were
her last, and very nearly fainting when she had done so."Miss Bellenden," said Lord Evandale, "you treat me like a fool or a
child.If you repent your engagement to me," he continued, indignantly,
"I am not a man to enforce it against your inclination; but deal with me
as a man, and forbear this trifling."He was about to go on, when he perceived, from her quivering eye and
pallid cheek, that nothing less than imposture was intended, and that by
whatever means her imagination had been so impressed, it was really
disturbed by unaffected awe and terror.He changed his tone, and exerted
all his eloquence in endeavouring to soothe and extract from her the
secret cause of such terror.she repeated,--"I saw Henry Morton stand at that window, and
look into the apartment at the moment I was on the point of abjuring him
for ever.His face was darker, thinner, and paler than it was wont to be;
his dress was a horseman's cloak, and hat looped down over his face; his
expression was like that he wore on that dreadful morning when he was
examined by Claverhouse at Tillietudlem.Ask your sister, ask Lady Emily,
if she did not see him as well as I. I know what has called him up,--he
came to upbraid me, that, while my heart was with him in the deep and
dead sea, I was about to give my hand to another.My lord, it is ended
between you and me; be the consequences what they will, she cannot marry
whose union disturbs the repose of the dead."said Evandale, as he paced the room, half mad himself with
surprise and vexation, "her fine understanding must be totally
overthrown, and that by the effort which she has made to comply with my
ill-timed, though well-meant, request.Without rest and attention her
health is ruined for ever."At this moment the door opened, and Halliday, who had been Lord
Evandale's principal personal attendant since they both left the Guards
on the Revolution, stumbled into the room with a countenance as pale and
ghastly as terror could paint it."What is the matter next, Halliday?""Any
discovery of the--"

He had just recollection sufficient to stop short in the midst of the
dangerous sentence."No, sir," said Halliday, "it is not that, nor anything like that; but I
have seen a ghost!"said Lord Evandale, forced altogether out
of his patience."Has all mankind sworn to go mad in order to drive me
so?"The ghost of Henry Morton, the Whig captain at Bothwell Bridge," replied
Halliday."He passed by me like a fire-flaught when I was in the garden!""This is midsummer madness," said Lord Evandale, "or there is some
strange villainy afloat.Jenny, attend your lady to her chamber, while I
endeavour to find a clue to all this."But Lord Evandale's inquiries were in vain.Jenny, who might have given
(had she chosen) a very satisfactory explanation, had an interest to
leave the matter in darkness; and interest was a matter which now weighed
principally with Jenny, since the possession of an active and
affectionate husband in her own proper right had altogether allayed her
spirit of coquetry.She had made the best use of the first moments of
confusion hastily to remove all traces of any one having slept in the
apartment adjoining to the parlour, and even to erase the mark of
footsteps beneath the window, through which she conjectured Morton's face
had been seen, while attempting, ere he left the garden, to gain one look
at her whom he had so long loved, and was now on the point of losing for
ever.That he had passed Halliday in the garden was equally clear; and
she learned from her elder boy, whom she had employed to have the
stranger's horse saddled and ready for his departure, that he had rushed
into the stable, thrown the child a broad gold piece, and, mounting his
horse, had ridden with fearful rapidity down towards the Clyde.The
secret was, therefore, in their own family, and Jenny was resolved it
should remain so."For, to be sure," she said, "although her lady and Halliday kend Mr.Morton by broad daylight, that was nae reason I suld own to kenning him
in the gloaming and by candlelight, and him keeping his face frae Cuddie
and me a' the time."So she stood resolutely upon the negative when examined by Lord Evandale.As for Halliday, he could only say that as he entered the garden-door,
the supposed apparition met him, walking swiftly, and with a visage on
which anger and grief appeared to be contending."He knew him well," he said, "having been repeatedly guard upon him, and
obliged to write down his marks of stature and visage in case of escape.But what should make him
haunt the country where he was neither hanged nor shot, he, the said
Halliday, did not pretend to conceive.Lady Emily confessed she had seen the face of a man at the window, but
her evidence went no farther.John Gudyill deponed _nil novit in causa_.He had left his gardening to get his morning dram just at the time when
the apparition had taken place.Lady Emily's servant was waiting orders
in the kitchen, and there was not another being within a quarter of a
mile of the house.Lord Evandale returned perplexed and dissatisfied in the highest degree
at beholding a plan which he thought necessary not less for the
protection of Edith in contingent circumstances, than for the assurance
of his own happiness, and which he had brought so very near perfection,
thus broken off without any apparent or rational cause.His knowledge of
Edith's character set her beyond the suspicion of covering any capricious
change of determination by a pretended vision.But he would have set the
apparition down to the influence of an overstrained imagination, agitated
by the circumstances in which she had so suddenly been placed, had it not
been for the coinciding testimony of Halliday, who had no reason for
thinking of Morton more than any other person, and knew nothing of Miss
Bellenden's vision when he promulgated his own.On the other hand, it
seemed in the highest degree improbable that Morton, so long and so
vainly sought after, and who was, with such good reason, supposed to be
lost when the "Vryheid" of Rotterdam went down with crew and passengers,
should be alive and lurking in this country, where there was no longer
any reason why he should not openly show himself, since the present
Government favoured his party in politics.When Lord Evandale reluctantly
brought himself to communicate these doubts to the chaplain, in order to
obtain his opinion, he could only obtain a long lecture on demonology, in
which, after quoting Delrio and Burthoog and De L'Ancre on the subject of
apparitions, together with sundry civilians and common lawyers on the
nature of testimony, the learned gentleman expressed his definite and
determined opinion to be, either that there had been an actual apparition
of the deceased Henry Morton's spirit, the possibility of which he was,
as a divine and a philosopher, neither fully prepared to admit or to
deny; or else that the said Henry Morton, being still in _rerum natura_,
had appeared in his proper person that morning; or, finally, that some
strong _deceptio visus_, or striking similitude of person, had deceived
the eyes of Miss Bellenden and of Thomas Halliday.Which of these was the
most probable hypothesis, the doctor declined to pronounce, but expressed
himself ready to die in the opinion that one or other of them had
occasioned that morning's disturbance.Lord Evandale soon had additional cause for distressful anxiety.Miss
Bellenden was declared to be dangerously ill."I will not leave this place," he exclaimed, "till she is pronounced to
be in safety.I neither can nor ought to do so; for whatever may have
been the immediate occasion of her illness, I gave the first cause for it
by my unhappy solicitation."He established himself, therefore, as a guest in the family, which the
presence of his sister, as well as of Lady Margaret Bellenden (who, in
despite of her rheumatism, caused herself to be transported thither when
she heard of her granddaughter's illness), rendered a step equally
natural and delicate.And thus he anxiously awaited until, without injury
to her health, Edith could sustain a final explanation ere his departure
on his expedition."She shall never," said the generous young man, "look on her engagement
with me as the means of fettering her to a union, the idea of which seems
almost to unhinge her understanding."Where once my careless childhood strayed,
               A stranger yet to pain.Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College.It is not by corporal wants and infirmities only that men of the most
distinguished talents are levelled, during their lifetime, with the
common mass of mankind.There are periods of mental agitation when the
firmest of mortals must be ranked with the weakest of his brethren, and
when, in paying the general tax of humanity, his distresses are even
aggravated by feeling that he transgresses, in the indulgence of his
grief, the rules of religion and philosophy by which he endeavours in
general to regulate his passions and his actions.It was during such a
paroxysm that the unfortunate Morton left Fairy Knowe.To know that his
long-loved and still-beloved Edith, whose image had filled his mind for
so many years, was on the point of marriage to his early rival, who had
laid claim to her heart by so many services as hardly left her a title to
refuse his addresses, bitter as the intelligence was, yet came not as an
unexpected blow.During his residence abroad he had once written to Edith.It was to bid
her farewell for ever, and to conjure her to forget him.He had requested
her not to answer his letter; yet he half hoped, for many a day, that she
might transgress his injunction.The letter never reached her to whom it
was addressed, and Morton, ignorant of its miscarriage, could only
conclude himself laid aside and forgotten, according to his own
self-denying request.All that he had heard of their mutual relations
since his return to Scotland prepared him to expect that he could only
look upon Miss Bellenden as the betrothed bride of Lord Evandale; and
even if freed from the burden of obligation to the latter, it would still
have been inconsistent with Morton's generosity of disposition to disturb
their arrangements, by attempting the assertion of a claim proscribed by
absence, never sanctioned by the consent of friends, and barred by a
thousand circumstances of difficulty.Why then did he seek the cottage
which their broken fortunes had now rendered the retreat of Lady Margaret
Bellenden and her granddaughter?He yielded, we are under the necessity
of acknowledging, to the impulse of an inconsistent wish which many might
have felt in his situation.Accident apprised him, while travelling towards his native district, that
the ladies, near whose mansion he must necessarily pass, were absent; and
learning that Cuddie and his wife acted as their principal domestics, he
could not resist pausing at their cottage to learn, if possible, the real
progress which Lord Evandale had made in the affections of Miss Bellen
den--alas!This rash experiment ended as we have
related, and he parted from the house of Fairy Knowe, conscious that he
was still beloved by Edith, yet compelled, by faith and honour, to
relinquish her for ever.With what feelings he must have listened to the
dialogue between Lord Evandale and Edith, the greater part of which he
involuntarily overheard, the reader must conceive, for we dare not
attempt to describe them.An hundred times he was tempted to burst upon
their interview, or to exclaim aloud, "Edith, I yet live!"and as often
the recollection of her plighted troth, and of the debt of gratitude
which he owed Lord Evandale (to whose influence with Claverhouse he
justly ascribed his escape from torture and from death), withheld him
from a rashness which might indeed have involved all in further distress,
but gave little prospect of forwarding his own happiness.He repressed
forcibly these selfish emotions, though with an agony which thrilled his
every nerve.was his internal oath, "never will I add a thorn to thy
pillow.That which Heaven has ordained, let it be; and let me not add, by
my selfish sorrows, one atom's weight to the burden thou hast to bear.I
was dead to thee when thy resolution was adopted; and never, never shalt
thou know that Henry Morton still lives!"As he formed this resolution, diffident of his own power to keep it, and
seeking that firmness in flight which was every moment shaken by his
continuing within hearing of Edith's voice, he hastily rushed from his
apartment by the little closet and the sashed door which led to the
garden.But firmly as he thought his resolution was fixed, he could not leave the
spot where the last tones of a voice so beloved still vibrated on his
ear, without endeavouring to avail himself of the opportunity which the
parlour window afforded to steal one last glance at the lovely speaker.It was in this attempt, made while Edith seemed to have her eyes
unalterably bent upon the ground, that Morton's presence was detected by
her raising them suddenly.So soon as her wild scream made this known to
the unfortunate object of a passion so constant, and which seemed so
ill-fated, he hurried from the place as if pursued by the furies.He
passed Halliday in the garden without recognising or even being sensible
that he had seen him, threw himself on his horse, and, by a sort of
instinct rather than recollection, took the first by-road in preference
to the public route to Hamilton.In all probability this prevented Lord Evandale from learning that he was
actually in existence; for the news that the Highlanders had obtained a
decisive victory at Killiecrankie had occasioned an accurate look-out to
be kept, by order of the Government, on all the passes, for fear of some
commotion among the Lowland Jacobites.They did not omit to post
sentinels on Bothwell Bridge; and as these men had not seen any traveller
pass westward in that direction, and as, besides, their comrades
stationed in the village of Bothwell were equally positive that none had
gone eastward, the apparition, in the existence of which Edith and
Halliday were equally positive, became yet more mysterious in the
judgment of Lord Evandale, who was finally inclined to settle in the
belief that the heated and disturbed imagination of Edith had summoned up
the phantom she stated herself to have seen, and that Halliday had, in
some unaccountable manner, been infected by the same superstition.Meanwhile, the by-path which Morton pursued, with all the speed which his
vigorous horse could exert, brought him in a very few seconds to the
brink of the Clyde, at a spot marked with the feet of horses, who were
conducted to it as a watering-place.The steed, urged as he was to the
gallop, did not pause a single instant, but, throwing himself into the
river, was soon beyond his depth.The plunge which the animal made as his
feet quitted the ground, with the feeling that the cold water rose above
his swordbelt, were the first incidents which recalled Morton, whose
movements had been hitherto mechanical, to the necessity of taking
measures for preserving himself and the noble animal which he bestrode.A
perfect master of all manly exercises, the management of a horse in water
was as familiar to him as when upon a meadow.He directed the animal's
course somewhat down the stream towards a low plain, or holm, which
seemed to promise an easy egress from the river.In the first and second
attempt to get on shore, the horse was frustrated by the nature of the
ground, and nearly fell backwards on his rider.The instinct of
self-preservation seldom fails, even in the most desperate circumstances,
to recall the human mind to some degree of equipoise, unless when
altogether distracted by terror, and Morton was obliged to the danger in
which he was placed for complete recovery of his self-possession.A third
attempt, at a spot more carefully and judiciously selected, succeeded
better than the former, and placed the horse and his rider in safety upon
the farther and left-hand bank of the Clyde."But whither," said Morton, in the bitterness of his heart, "am I now to
direct my course?or rather, what does it signify to which point of the
compass a wretch so forlorn betakes himself?I would to God, could the
wish be without a sin, that these dark waters had flowed over me, and
drowned my recollection of that which was, and that which is!"The sense of impatience, which the disturbed state of his feelings had
occasioned, scarcely had vented itself in these violent expressions, ere
he was struck with shame at having given way to such a paroxysm.He
remembered how signally the life which he now held so lightly in the
bitterness of his disappointment had been preserved through the almost
incessant perils which had beset him since he entered upon his public
career.he said, "and worse than a fool, to set light by that
existence which Heaven has so often preserved in the most marvellous
manner.Something there yet remains for me in this world, were it only to
bear my sorrows like a man, and to aid those who need my assistance.What
have I seen, what have I heard, but the very conclusion of that which I
knew was to happen?They"--he durst not utter their names even in
soliloquy--"they are embarrassed and in difficulties.She is stripped of
her inheritance, and he seems rushing on some dangerous career, with
which, but for the low voice in which he spoke, I might have become
acquainted.Are there no means to aid or to warn them?"As he pondered upon this topic, forcibly withdrawing his mind from his
own disappointment, and compelling his attention to the affairs of Edith
and her betrothed husband, the letter of Burley, long forgotten, suddenly
rushed on his memory, like a ray of light darting through a mist."Their ruin must have been his work," was his internal conclusion."If it
can be repaired, it must be through his means, or by information obtained
from him.Stern, crafty, and enthusiastic as he
is, my plain and downright rectitude of purpose has more than once
prevailed with him.I will seek him out, at least; and who knows what
influence the information I may acquire from him may have on the fortunes
of those whom I shall never see more, and who will probably never learn
that I am now suppressing my own grief, to add, if possible, to their
happiness."Animated by these hopes, though the foundation was but slight, he sought
the nearest way to the high-road; and as all the tracks through the
valley were known to him since he hunted through them in youth, he had no
other difficulty than that of surmounting one or two enclosures, ere he
found himself on the road to the small burgh where the feast of the
popinjay had been celebrated.He journeyed in a state of mind sad indeed
and dejected, yet relieved from its earlier and more intolerable state of
anguish; for virtuous resolution and manly disinterestedness seldom fail
to restore tranquillity even where they cannot create happiness.He
turned his thoughts with strong effort upon the means of discovering
Burley, and the chance there was of extracting from him any knowledge
which he might possess favourable to her in whose cause he interested
himself; and at length formed the resolution of guiding himself by the
circumstances in which he might discover the object of his quest,
trusting that, from Cuddie's account of a schism betwixt Burley and his
brethren of the Presbyterian persuasion, he might find him less
rancorously disposed against Miss Bellenden, and inclined to exert the
power which he asserted himself to possess over her fortunes, more
favourably than heretofore.Noontide had passed away when our traveller found himself in the
neighbourhood of his deceased uncle's habitation of Milnwood.It rose
among glades and groves that were chequered with a thousand early
recollections of joy and sorrow, and made upon Morton that mournful
impression, soft and affecting, yet, withal, soothing, which the
sensitive mind usually receives from a return to the haunts of childhood
and early youth, after having experienced the vicissitudes and tempests
of public life.A strong desire came upon him to visit the house itself."Old Alison," he thought, "will not know me, more than the honest couple
whom I saw yesterday.I may indulge my curiosity, and proceed on my
journey, without her having any knowledge of my existence.I think they
said my uncle had bequeathed to her my family mansion,--well, be it so.I
have enough to sorrow for, to enable me to dispense with lamenting such a
disappointment as that; and yet methinks he has chosen an odd successor
in my grumbling old dame, to a line of respectable, if not distinguished,
ancestry.Let it be as it may, I will visit the old mansion at least once
more."The house of Milnwood, even in its best days, had nothing cheerful about
it; but its gloom appeared to be doubled under the auspices of the old
housekeeper.Everything, indeed, was in repair; there were no slates
deficient upon the steep grey roof, and no panes broken in the narrow
windows.But the grass in the court-yard looked as if the foot of man had
not been there for years; the doors were carefully locked, and that which
admitted to the hall seemed to have been shut for a length of time, since
the spiders had fairly drawn their webs over the door-way and the
staples.Living sight or sound there was none, until, after much
knocking, Morton heard the little window, through which it was
usual to reconnoitre visitors, open with much caution.The face of
Alison, puckered with some score of wrinkles in addition to those with
which it was furrowed when Morton left Scotland, now presented itself,
enveloped in a _toy_, from under the protection of which some of her grey
tresses had escaped in a manner more picturesque than beautiful, while
her shrill, tremulous voice demanded the cause of the knocking."I wish to speak an instant with one Alison Wilson, who resides here,"
said Henry."She's no at hame the day," answered Mrs.Wilson, _in propria persona_,
the state of whose headdress, perhaps, inspired her with this direct mode
of denying herself; "and ye are but a mislear'd person to speer for her
in sic a manner.Ye might hae had an M under your belt for Mistress
Wilson of Milnwood.""I beg pardon," said Morton, internally smiling at finding in old Ailie
the same jealousy of disrespect which she used to exhibit upon former
occasions,--"I beg pardon; I am but a stranger in this country, and have
been so long abroad that I have almost forgotten my own language."said Ailie; "then maybe ye may hae
heard of a young gentleman of this country that they ca' Henry Morton?""I have heard," said Morton, "of such a name in Germany.""Then bide a wee bit where ye are, friend; or stay,--gang round by the
back o' the house, and ye'll find a laigh door; it's on the latch, for
it's never barred till sunset.Ye 'll open 't,--and tak care ye dinna fa'
ower the tub, for the entry's dark,--and then ye'll turn to the right,
and then ye'll hand straught forward, and then ye'll turn to the right
again, and ye 'll tak heed o' the cellarstairs, and then ye 'll be at the
door o' the little kitchen,--it's a' the kitchen that's at Milnwood
now,--and I'll come down t'ye, and whate'er ye wad say to Mistress
Wilson ye may very safely tell it to me."A stranger might have had some difficulty, notwithstanding the minuteness
of the directions supplied by Ailie, to pilot himself in safety through
the dark labyrinth of passages that led from the back-door to the little
kitchen; but Henry was too well acquainted with the navigation of these
straits to experience danger, either from the Scylla which lurked on one
side in shape of a bucking tub, or the Charybdis which yawned on the
other in the profundity of a winding cellar-stair.His only impediment
arose from the snarling and vehement barking of a small cocking spaniel,
once his own property, but which, unlike to the faithful Argus, saw his
master return from his wanderings without any symptom of recognition.said Morton to himself, on being disowned by
his former favourite."I am so changed that no breathing creature that I
have known and loved will now acknowledge me!"At this moment he had reached the kitchen; and soon after, the tread of
Alison's high heels, and the pat of the crutch-handled cane which served
at once to prop and to guide her footsteps, were heard upon the
stairs,--an annunciation which continued for some time ere she fairly
reached the kitchen.Morton had, therefore, time to survey the slender preparations for
housekeeping which were now sufficient in the house of his ancestors.The
fire, though coals are plenty in that neighbourhood, was husbanded with
the closest attention to economy of fuel, and the small pipkin, in which
was preparing the dinner of the old woman and her maid-of-all-work, a
girl of twelve years old, intimated, by its thin and watery vapour, that
Ailie had not mended her cheer with her improved fortune.When she entered, the head, which nodded with self-importance; the
features, in which an irritable peevishness, acquired by habit and
indulgence, strove with a temper naturally affectionate and good-natured;
the coif; the apron; the blue-checked gown,--were all those of old Ailie;
but laced pinners, hastily put on to meet the stranger, with some other
trifling articles of decoration, marked the difference between Mrs.Wilson, life-rentrix of Milnwood, and the housekeeper of the late
proprietor."What were ye pleased to want wi' Mrs.Wilson,"
was her first address; for the five minutes time which she had gained for
the business of the toilet entitled her, she conceived, to assume the
full merit of her illustrious name, and shine forth on her guest in
unchastened splendour.Morton's sensations, confounded between the past
and present, fairly confused him so much that he would have had
difficulty in answering her, even if he had known well what to say.But
as he had not determined what character he was to adopt while concealing
that which was properly his own, he had an additional reason for
remaining silent.Wilson, in perplexity, and with some apprehension,
repeated her question."What were ye pleased to want wi' me, sir?"Pardon me, madam," answered Henry, "it was of one Silas Morton I spoke.""It was his father, then, ye kent o', the brother o' the late Milnwood?Ye canna mind him abroad, I wad think,--he was come hame afore ye were
born.I thought ye had brought me news of poor Maister Harry.""It was from my father I learned to know Colonel Morton," said Henry; "of
the son I know little or nothing,--rumour says he died abroad on his
passage to Holland.""That's ower like to be true," said the old woman with a sigh, "and mony
a tear it's cost my auld een.His uncle, poor gentleman, just sough'd awa
wi' it in his mouth.He had been gieing me preceeze directions anent the
bread and the wine and the brandy at his burial, and how often it was to
be handed round the company (for, dead or alive, he was a prudent,
frugal, painstaking man), and then he said, said he, 'Ailie,' (he aye
ca'd me Ailie; we were auld acquaintance), 'Ailie, take ye care and haud
the gear weel thegither; for the name of Morton of Milnwood's gane out
like the last sough of an auld sang.'And sae he fell out o' ae dwam into
another, and ne'er spak a word mair, unless it were something we cou'dna
mak out, about a dipped candle being gude eneugh to see to dee wi'.He
cou'd ne'er bide to see a moulded ane, and there was ane, by ill luck, on
the table."Wilson was thus detailing the last moments of the old miser,
Morton was pressingly engaged in diverting the assiduous curiosity of the
dog, which, recovered from his first surprise, and combining former
recollections, had, after much snuffing and examination, begun a course
of capering and jumping upon the stranger which threatened every instant
to betray him.At length, in the urgency of his impatience, Morton could
not forbear exclaiming, in a tone of hasty impatience, "Down, Elphin!"Ye ken our dog's name," said the old lady, struck with great and sudden
surprise,--"ye ken our dog's name, and it's no a common ane.And the
creature kens you too," she continued, in a more agitated and shriller
tone,--"God guide us!So saying, the poor old woman threw herself around Morton's neck, cling
to him, kissed him as if he had been actually her child, and wept for
joy.There was no parrying the discovery, if he could have had the heart
to attempt any further disguise.He returned the embrace with the most
grateful warmth, and answered,--

"I do indeed live, dear Ailie, to thank you for all your kindness, past
and present, and to rejoice that there is at least one friend to welcome
me to my native country."exclaimed Ailie, "ye'll hae mony friends,--ye 'll hae mony
friends; for ye will hae gear, hinny,--ye will hae gear.Heaven mak ye a
gude guide o't!she continued, pushing him back from her
with her trembling hand and shrivelled arm, and gazing in his face as if
to read, at more convenient distance, the ravages which sorrow rather
than time had made on his face,--"Eh, sirs!ye're sair altered, hinny;
your face is turned pale, and your een are sunken, and your bonny
red-and-white cheeks are turned a' dark and sun-burnt.mony's the comely face they destroy.--And when cam ye here, hinny?And what for did ye na
write to us?And how cam ye to pass yoursell for dead?And what for did
ye come creepin' to your ain house as if ye had been an unto body, to gie
poor auld Ailie sic a start?"It was some time ere Morton could overcome his own emotion so as to give
the kind old woman the information which we shall communicate to our
readers in the next chapter.Aumerle that was,
               But that is gone for being Richard's friend;
               And, madam, you must call him Rutland now.The scene of explanation was hastily removed from the little kitchen to
Mrs.Wilson's own matted room,--the very same which she had occupied as
housekeeper, and which she continued to retain.Mary moved to the bathroom."It was," she said,
"better secured against sifting winds than the hall, which she had found
dangerous to her rheumatisms, and it was more fitting for her use than
the late Milnwood's apartment, honest man, which gave her sad thoughts;"
and as for the great oak parlour, it was never opened but to be aired,
washed, and dusted, according to the invariable practice of the family,
unless upon their most solemn festivals.In the matted room, therefore,
they were settled, surrounded by pickle-pots and conserves of all kinds,
which the ci-devant housekeeper continued to compound, out of mere habit,
although neither she herself, nor any one else, ever partook of the
comfits which she so regularly prepared.Morton, adapting his narrative to the comprehension of his auditor,
informed her briefly of the wreck of the vessel and the loss of all
hands, excepting two or three common seamen who had early secured the
skiff, and were just putting off from the vessel when he leaped from the
deck into their boat, and unexpectedly, as well as contrary to their
inclination, made himself partner of their voyage and of their safety.Landed at Flushing, he was fortunate enough to meet with an old officer
who had been in service with his father.By his advice, he shunned going
immediately to the Hague, but forwarded his letters to the court of the
Stadtholder."Our prince," said the veteran, "must as yet keep terms with his
father-in-law and with your King Charles; and to approach him in the
character of a Scottish malecontent would render it imprudent for him to
distinguish you by his favour.Wait, therefore, his orders, without
forcing yourself on his notice; observe the strictest prudence and
retirement; assume for the present a different name; shun the company of
the British exiles; and, depend upon it, you will not repent your
prudence."The old friend of Silas Morton argued justly.After a considerable time
had elapsed, the Prince of Orange, in a progress through the United
States, came to the town where Morton, impatient at his situation and the
incognito which he was obliged to observe, still continued, nevertheless,
to be a resident.He had an hour of private interview assigned, in which
the prince expressed himself highly pleased with his intelligence, his
prudence, and the liberal view which he seemed to take of the factions of
his native country, their motives and their purposes."I would gladly," said William, "attach you to my own person; but that
cannot be without giving offence in England.But I will do as much for
you, as well out of respect for the sentiments you have expressed, as for
the recommendations you have brought me.Here is a commission in a Swiss
regiment at present in garrison in a distant province, where you will
meet few or none of your countrymen.Continue to be Captain Melville, and
let the name of Morton sleep till better days.""Thus began my fortune," continued Morton; "and my services have, on
various occasions, been distinguished by his Royal Highness, until the
moment that brought him to Britain as our political deliverer.His
commands must excuse my silence to my few friends in Scotland; and I
wonder not at the report of my death, considering the wreck of the
vessel, and that I found no occasion to use the letters of exchange with
which I was furnished by the liberality of some of them,--a circumstance
which must have confirmed the belief that I had perished.""But, dear hinny," asked Mrs.Wilson, "did ye find nae Scotch body at the
Prince of Oranger's court that kend ye?I wad hae thought Morton o'
Milnwood was kend a' through the country.""I was purposely engaged in distant service," said Morton, "until a
period when few, without as deep and kind a motive of interest as yours,
Ailie, would have known the stripling Morton in Major-General Melville.""Malville was your mother's name," said Mrs.Wilson; "but Morton sounds
far bonnier in my auld lugs.And when ye tak up the lairdship, ye maun
tak the auld name and designation again.""I am like to be in no haste to do either the one or the other, Ailie,
for I have some reasons for the present to conceal my being alive from
every one but you; and as for the lairdship of Milnwood, it is in as good
hands.""As gude hands, hinny!"re-echoed Ailie; "I'm hopefu' ye are no meaning
mine?The rents and the lands are but a sair fash to me.And I'm ower
failed to tak a helpmate, though Wylie Mactrickit the writer was very
pressing, and spak very civilly; but I'm ower auld a cat to draw that
strae before me.He canna whilliwhaw me as he's dune mony a ane.And then
I thought aye ye wad come back, and I wad get my pickle meal and my soup
milk, and keep a' things right about ye as I used to do in your puir
uncle's time, and it wad be just pleasure eneugh for me to see ye thrive
and guide the gear canny.Ye'll hae learned that in Holland, I'se
warrant, for they're thrifty folk there, as I hear tell.--But ye'll be
for keeping rather a mair house than puir auld Milnwood that's gave; and,
indeed, I would approve o' your eating butchermeat maybe as aften as
three times a-week,--it keeps the wind out o' the stamack.""We will talk of all this another time," said Morton, surprised at the
generosity upon a large scale which mingled in Ailie's thoughts and
actions with habitual and sordid parsimony, and at the odd contrast
between her love of saving and indifference to self-acquisition."You
must know," he continued, "that I am in this country only for a few days
on some special business of importance to the Government, and therefore,
Ailie, not a word of having seen me.At some other time I will acquaint
you fully with my motives and intentions.""E'en be it sae, my jo," replied Ailie, "I can keep a secret like my
neighbours; and weel auld Milnwood kend it, honest man, for he tauld me
where he keepit his gear, and that's what maist folk like to hae as
private as possibly may be.--But come awa wi' me, hinny, till I show ye
the oak-parlour how grandly it's keepit, just as if ye had been expected
haine every day,--I loot naebody sort it but my ain hands.It was a kind
o' divertisement to me, though whiles the tear wan into my ee, and I said
to mysell, What needs I fash wi' grates and carpets and cushions and the
muckle brass candlesticks ony mair?for they'll ne'er come hame that
aught it rightfully."With these words she hauled him away to this sanctum sanctorum, the
scrubbing and cleaning whereof was her daily employment, as its high
state of good order constituted the very pride of her heart.Morton, as
he followed her into the room, underwent a rebuke for not "dighting his
shune," which showed that Ailie had not relinquished her habits of
authority.On entering the oak-parlour he could not but recollect the
feelings of solemn awe with which, when a boy, he had been affected at
his occasional and rare admission to an apartment which he then supposed
had not its equal save in the halls of princes.It may be readily
supposed that the worked-worsted chairs, with their short ebony legs and
long upright backs, had lost much of their influence over his mind; that
the large brass andirons seemed diminished in splendour; that the green
worsted tapestry appeared no masterpiece of the Arras loom; and that the
room looked, on the whole, dark, gloomy, and disconsolate.Yet there were
two objects, "The counterfeit presentment of two brothers," which,
dissimilar as those described by Hamlet, affected his mind with a variety
of sensations.One full-length portrait represented his father in
complete armour, with a countenance indicating his masculine and
determined character; and the other set forth his uncle, in velvet and
brocade, looking as if he were ashamed of his own finery, though entirely
indebted for it to the liberality of the painter."It was an idle fancy," Ailie said, "to dress the honest auld man in thae
expensive fal-lalls that he ne'er wore in his life, instead o' his douce
Raploch grey, and his band wi' the narrow edging."In private, Morton could not help being much of her opinion; for anything
approaching to the dress of a gentleman sate as ill on the ungainly
person of his relative as an open or generous expression would have done
on his mean and money-making features.He now extricated himself from
Ailie to visit some of his haunts in the neighbouring wood, while her own
hands made an addition to the dinner she was preparing,--an incident no
otherwise remarkable than as it cost the life of a fowl, which, for any
event of less importance than the arrival of Henry Morton, might have
cackled on to a good old age ere Ailie could have been guilty of the
extravagance of killing and dressing it.The meal was seasoned by talk of
old times and by the plans which Ailie laid out for futurity, in which
she assigned her young master all the prudential habits of her old one,
and planned out the dexterity with which she was to exercise her duty as
governante.Morton let the old woman enjoy her day-dreams and
castle-building during moments of such pleasure, and deferred till some
fitter occasion the communication of his purpose again to return and
spend his life upon the Continent.His next care was to lay aside his military dress, which he considered
likely to render more difficult his researches after Burley.He exchanged
it--for a grey doublet and cloak, formerly his usual attire at Milnwood,
and which Mrs.Wilson produced from a chest of walnut-tree, wherein she
had laid them aside, without forgetting carefully to brush and air them
from time to time.Morton retained his sword and fire-arms, without which
few persons travelled in those unsettled times.When he appeared in his
new attire, Mrs.Wilson was first thankful "that they fitted him sae
decently, since, though he was nae fatter, yet he looked mair manly than
when he was taen frae Milnwood."Next she enlarged on the advantage of saving old clothes to be what she
called "beet-masters to the new," and was far advanced in the history of
a velvet cloak belonging to the late Milnwood, which had first been
converted to a velvet doublet, and then into a pair of breeches, and
appeared each time as good as new, when Morton interrupted her account of
its transmigration to bid her good-by.He gave, indeed, a sufficient shock to her feelings, by expressing the
necessity he was under of proceeding on his journey that evening.And whar wad ye
sleep but in your ain house, after ye hae been sae mony years frae hame?""I feel all the unkindness of it, Ailie, but it must be so; and that was
the reason that I attempted to conceal myself from you, as I suspected
you would not let me part from you so easily.""But whar are ye gaun, then?""Saw e'er mortal een
the like o' you, just to come ae moment, and flee awa like an arrow out
of a bow the neist?""I must go down," replied Morton, "to Niel Blane the Piper's Howff; he
can give me a bed, I suppose?"I'se warrant can he," replied Ailie, "and gar ye pay weel for 't
into the bargain.Laddie, I daresay ye hae lost your wits in thae foreign
parts, to gang and gie siller for a supper and a bed, and might hae baith
for naething, and thanks t' ye for accepting them.""I assure you, Ailie," said Morton, desirous to silence her
remonstrances, "that this is a business of great importance, in which I
may be a great gainer, and cannot possibly be a loser.""I dinna see how that can be, if ye begin by gieing maybe the feck o'
twal shillings Scots for your supper; but young folks are aye
venturesome, and think to get siller that way.My puir auld master took
a surer gate, and never parted wi' it when he had anes gotten 't."Persevering in his desperate resolution, Morton took leave of Ailie, and
mounted his horse to proceed to the little town, after exacting a solemn
promise that she would conceal his return until she again saw or heard
from him."I am not very extravagant," was his natural reflection, as he trotted
slowly towards the town; "but were Ailie and I to set up house together,
as she proposes, I think my profusion would break the good old creature's
heart before a week were out."Where's the jolly host
               You told me of?'T has been my custom ever
               To parley with mine host.Morton reached the borough town without meeting with any remarkable
adventure, and alighted at the little inn.It had occurred to him more
than once, while upon his journey, that his resumption of the dress which
he had worn while a youth, although favourable to his views in other
respects, might render it more difficult for him to remain incognito.But
a few years of campaigns and wandering had so changed his appearance that
he had great confidence that in the grown man, whose brows exhibited the
traces of resolution and considerate thought, none would recognise the
raw and bashful stripling who won the game of the popinjay.The only
chance was that here and there some Whig, whom he had led to battle,
might remember the Captain of the Milnwood Marksmen; but the risk, if
there was any, could not be guarded against.The Howff seemed full and frequented as if possessed of all its old
celebrity.The person and demeanour of Niel Blane, more fat and less
civil than of yore, intimated that he had increased as well in purse as
in corpulence; for in Scotland a landlord's complaisance for his guests
decreases in exact proportion to his rise in the world.His daughter had
acquired the air of a dexterous barmaid, undisturbed by the circumstances
of love and war, so apt to perplex her in the exercise of her vocation.Both showed Morton the degree of attention which could have been expected
by a stranger travelling without attendants, at a time when they were
particularly the badges of distinction.He took upon himself exactly the
character his appearance presented, went to the stable and saw his horse
accommodated, then returned to the house, and seating himself in the
public room (for to request one to himself would, in those days, have
been thought an overweening degree of conceit), he found himself in the
very apartment in which he had some years before celebrated his victory
at the game of the popinjay,--a jocular preferment which led to so many
serious consequences.He felt himself, as may well be supposed, a much changed man since that
festivity; and yet, to look around him, the groups assembled in the Howff
seemed not dissimilar to those which the same scene had formerly
presented.Two or three burghers husbanded their "dribbles o' brandy;"
two or three dragoons lounged over their muddy ale, and cursed the
inactive times that allowed them no better cheer.Their cornet did not,
indeed, play at backgammon with the curate in his cassock, but he drank
a little modicum of _aqua mirabilis_ with the grey-cloaked Presbyterian
minister.The scene was another, and yet the same, differing only in
persons, but corresponding in general character.Let the tide of the world wax or wane as it will, Morton thought as he
looked around him, enough will be found to fill the places which chance
renders vacant; and in the usual occupations and amusements of life,
human beings will succeed each other as leaves upon the same tree, with
the same individual difference and the same general resemblance.After pausing a few minutes, Morton, whose experience had taught him the
readiest mode of securing attention, ordered a pint of claret; and as the
smiling landlord appeared with the pewter measure foaming fresh from the
tap (for bottling wine was not then in fashion), he asked him to sit down
and take a share of the good cheer.This invitation was peculiarly
acceptable to Niel Blane, who, if he did not positively expect it from
every guest not provided with better company, yet received it from many,
and was not a whit abashed or surprised at the summons.He sat down,
along with his guest, in a secluded nook near the chimney; and while he
received encouragement to drink by far the greater share of the liquor
before them, he entered at length, as a part of his expected functions,
upon the news of the country,--the births, deaths, and marriages; the
change of property; the downfall of old families, and the rise of new.But politics, now the fertile source of eloquence, mine host did not care
to mingle in his theme; and it was only in answer to a question of Morton
that he replied, with an air of indifference, "Um!we aye hae sodgers
amang us, mair or less.There's a wheen German horse down at Glasgow
yonder; they ca' their commander Wittybody, or some sic name, though he's
as grave and grewsome an auld Dutchman as e'er I saw."said Morton,--"an old man, with grey hair and
short black moustaches; speaks seldom?""And smokes for ever," replied Niel Blane."I see your honour kens the
man.He may be a very gude man too, for aught I see,--that is,
considering he is a sodger and a Dutchman; but if he were ten generals,
and as mony Wittybodies, he has nae skill in the pipes; he gar'd me stop
in the middle of Torphichen's Rant,--the best piece o' music that ever
bag gae wind to.""But these fellows," said Morton, glancing his eye towards the soldiers
"that were in the apartment, are not of his corps?""Na, na, these are Scotch dragoons," said mine host,--"our ain auld
caterpillars; these were Claver'se's lads a while syne, and wad be again,
maybe, if he had the lang ten in his hand.""Is there not a report of his death?""Troth is there," said the landlord; "your honour is right,--there is sic
a fleeing rumour; but, in my puir opinion, it's lang or the deil die.I
wad hae the folks here look to themsells.If he makes an outbreak, he'll
be doun frae the Hielands or I could drink this glass,--and whare are
they then?A' thae hell-rakers o' dragoons wad be at his whistle in a
moment.Nae doubt they're Willie's men e'en now, as they were James's a
while syne; and reason good,--they fight for their pay; what else hae
they to fight for?They hae neither lands nor houses, I trow.There's ae
gude thing o' the change, or the Revolution, as they ca' it,--folks may
speak out afore thae birkies now, and nae fear o' being hauled awa to the
guard-house, or having the thumikins screwed on your finger-ends, just as
I wad drive the screw through a cork."There was a little pause, when Morton, feeling confident in the progress
he had made in mine host's familiarity, asked, though with the hesitation
proper to one who puts a question on the answer to which rests something
of importance, "Whether Blane knew a woman in that neighbourhood called
Elizabeth Maclure?""Whether I ken Bessie Maclure?"answered the landlord, with a landlord's
laugh,--"How can I but ken my ain wife's (haly be her rest!)--my ain
wife's first gudeman's sister, Bessie Maclure?An honest wife she is, but
sair she's been trysted wi' misfortunes,--the loss o' twa decent lads o'
sons, in the time o' the persecution, as they ca' it nowadays; and
doucely and decently she has borne her burden, blaming nane and
condemning nane.If there's an honest woman in the world, it's Bessie
Maclure.And to lose her twa sons, as I was saying, and to hae dragoons
clinked down on her for a month bypast,--for, be Whig or Tory uppermost,
they aye quarter thae loons on victuallers,--to lose, as I was saying--"

"This woman keeps an inn, then?""A public, in a puir way," replied Blane, looking round at his own
superior accommodations,--"a sour browst o' sma' ale that she sells to
folk that are over drouthy wi' travel to be nice; but naething to ca' a
stirring trade or a thriving changehouse.""Your honour will rest here a' the night?Ye'll hardly get accommodation
at Bessie's," said Niel, whose regard for his deceased wife's relative by
no means extended to sending company from his own house to hers."There is a friend," answered Morton, "whom I am to meet with there, and
I only called here to take a stirrup-cup and inquire the way.""Your honour had better," answerd the landlord, with the perseverance of
his calling, "send some ane to warn your friend to come on here.""I tell you, landlord," answered Morton, impatiently, "that will not
serve my purpose; I must go straight to this woman Maclure's house, and
I desire you to find me a guide.""Aweel, sir, ye'll choose for yoursell, to be sure," said Niel Blane,
somewhat disconcerted; "but deil a guide ye'll need if ye gae doun the
water for twa mile or sae, as gin ye were bound for Milnwoodhouse, and
then tak the first broken disjasked-looking road that makes for the
hills,--ye'll ken 't by a broken ash-tree that stands at the side o' a
burn just where the roads meet; and then travel out the path,--ye canna
miss Widow Maclure's public, for deil another house or hauld is on the
road for ten lang Scots miles, and that's worth twenty English.I am
sorry your honour would think o' gaun out o' my house the night.But my
wife's gude-sister is a decent woman, and it's no lost that a friend
gets."Morton accordingly paid his reckoning and departed.The sunset of the
summer day placed him at the ash-tree, where the path led up towards the
moors."Here," he said to himself, "my misfortunes commenced; for just here,
when Burley and I were about to separate on the first night we ever met,
he was alarmed by the intelligence that the passes were secured by
soldiers lying in wait for him.Beneath that very ash sate the old woman
who apprised him of his danger.How strange that my whole fortunes should
have become inseparably interwoven with that man's, without anything more
on my part than the discharge of an ordinary duty of humanity!Would to
Heaven it were possible I could find my humble quiet and tranquillity of
mind upon the spot where I lost them!"Thus arranging his reflections betwixt speech and thought, he turned his
horse's head up the path.Evening lowered around him as he advanced up the narrow dell which had
once been a wood, but was now a ravine divested of trees, unless where a
few, from their inaccessible situation on the edge of precipitous banks,
or clinging among rocks and huge stones, defied the invasion of men and
of cattle, like the scattered tribes of a conquered country, driven to
take refuge in the barren strength of its mountains.These too, wasted
and decayed, seemed rather to exist than to flourish, and only served to
indicate what the landscape had once been.But the stream brawled down
among them in all its freshness and vivacity, giving the life and
animation which a mountain rivulet alone can confer on the barest and
most savage scenes, and which the inhabitants of such a country miss when
gazing even upon the tranquil winding of a majestic stream through plains
of fertility, and beside palaces of splendour.The track of the road
followed the course of the brook, which was now visible, and now only to
be distinguished by its brawling heard among the stones or in the clefts
of the rock that occasionally interrupted its course."Murmurer that thou art," said Morton, in the enthusiasm of his reverie,
"why chafe with the rocks that stop thy course for a moment?There is a
sea to receive thee in its bosom; and there is an eternity for man when
his fretful and hasty course through the vale of time shall be ceased and
over.What thy petty fuming is to the deep and vast billows of a
shoreless ocean, are our cares, hopes, fears, joys, and sorrows to the
objects which must occupy us through the awful and boundless succession
of ages!"Thus moralizing, our traveller passed on till the dell opened, and the
banks, receding from the brook, left a little green vale, exhibiting a
croft, or small field, on which some corn was growing, and a cottage,
whose walls were not above five feet high, and whose thatched roof, green
with moisture, age, houseleek, and grass, had in some places suffered
damage from the encroachment of two cows, whose appetite this appearance
of verdure had diverted from their more legitimate pasture.An ill-spelt
and worse-written inscription intimated to the traveller that he might
here find refreshment for man and horse,--no unacceptable intimation,
rude as the hut appeared to be, considering the wild path he had trod in
approaching it, and the high and waste mountains which rose in desolate
dignity behind this humble asylum.It must indeed have been, thought Morton, in some such spot as this that
Burley was likely to find a congenial confident.As he approached, he observed the good dame of the house herself, seated
by the door; she had hitherto been concealed from him by a huge
alder-bush."Good evening, Mother," said the traveller."Your name is Mistress
Maclure?""Elizabeth Maclure, sir, a poor widow," was the reply."Can you lodge a stranger for a night?""I can, sir, if he will be pleased with the widow's cake and the widow's
cruse.""I have been a soldier, good dame," answered Morton, "and nothing can
come amiss to me in the way of entertainment."said the old woman, with a sigh,--"God send ye a better
trade!""It is believed to be an honourable profession, my good dame; I hope you
do not think the worse of me for having belonged to it?""I judge no one, sir," replied the woman, "and your voice sounds like
that of a civil gentleman; but I hae witnessed sae muckle ill wi'
sodgering in this puir land that I am e'en content that I can see nae
mair o't wi' these sightless organs."As she spoke thus, Morton observed that she was blind."Shall I not be troublesome to you, my good dame?"said he,
compassionately; "your infirmity seems ill calculated for your
profession.""Na, sir," answered the old woman, "I can gang about the house readily
eneugh; and I hae a bit lassie to help me, and the dragoon lads will look
after your horse when they come hame frae their patrol, for a sma'
matter; they are civiller now than lang syne.""Peggy, my bonny bird," continued the hostess, addressing a little girl
of twelve years old, who had by this time appeared, "tak the gentleman's
horse to the stable, and slack his girths, and tak aff the bridle, and
shake down a lock o' hay before him, till the dragoons come back.--Come
this way, sir," she continued; "ye'll find my house clean, though it's a
puir ane."Morton followed her into the cottage accordingly.Then out and spake the auld mother,
               And fast her tears did fa
               "Ye wadna be warn'd, my son Johnie,
               Frae the hunting to bide awa!"When he entered the cottage, Morton perceived that the old hostess had
spoken truth.The inside of the hut belied its outward appearance, and
was neat, and even comfortable, especially the inner apartment, in which
the hostess informed her guest that he was to sup and sleep.Refreshments
were placed before him such as the little inn afforded; and though he had
small occasion for them, he accepted the offer, as the means of
maintaining some discourse with the landlady.Notwithstanding her
blindness, she was assiduous in her attendance, and seemed, by a sort of
instinct, to find her way to what she wanted."Have you no one but this pretty little girl to assist you in waiting on
your guests?""None, sir," replied his old hostess; "I dwell alone, like the widow of
Zarephath.Few guests come to this puir place, and I haena custom eneugh
to hire servants.I had anes twa fine sons that lookit after a' thing.--But God gives and takes away,--His name be praised!"she continued,
turning her clouded eyes towards Heaven.--"I was anes better off, that
is, waridly speaking, even since I lost them; but that was before this
last change."said Morton; "and yet you are a Presbyterian, my good mother?""I am, sir; praised be the light that showed me the right way," replied
the landlady."Then I should have thought," continued the guest, "the Revolution would
have brought you nothing but good.""If," said the old woman, "it has brought the land gude, and freedom of
worship to tender consciences, it's little matter what it has brought to
a puir blind worm like me.""Still," replied Morton, "I cannot see how it could possibly injure you.""It's a lang story, sir," answered his hostess, with a sigh."But ae
night, sax weeks or thereby afore Bothwell Brigg, a young gentleman
stopped at this puir cottage, stiff and bloody with wounds, pale and dune
out wi' riding, and his horse sae weary he couldna drag ae foot after the
other, and his foes were close ahint him, and he was ane o' our enemies.You that's a sodger will think me but a silly auld
wife; but I fed him, and relieved him, and keepit him hidden till the
pursuit was ower.""And who," said Morton, "dares disapprove of your having done so?""I kenna," answered the blind woman; "I gat ill-will about it amang some
o' our ain folk.They said I should hae been to him what Jael was to
Sisera.But weel I wot I had nae divine command to shed blood, and to
save it was baith like a woman and a Christian.And then they said I
wanted natural affection, to relieve ane that belanged to the band that
murdered my twa sons.""Ay, sir; though maybe ye'll gie their deaths another name.The tane fell
wi' sword in hand, fighting for a broken national Covenant; the
tother,--oh, they took him and shot him dead on the green before his
mother's face!My auld een dazzled when the shots were looten off, and,
to my thought, they waxed weaker and weaker ever since that weary day;
and sorrow, and heart-break, and tears that would not be dried, might
help on the disorder.betraying Lord Evandale's young blood
to his enemies' sword wad ne'er hae brought my Ninian and Johnie alive
again.""Was it Lord Evandale whose
life you saved?""In troth, even his," she replied."And kind he was to me after, and gae
me a cow and calf, malt, meal, and siller, and nane durst steer me when
he was in power.But we live on an outside bit of Tillietudlem land, and
the estate was sair plea'd between Leddy Margaret Bellenden and the
present laird, Basil Olifant, and Lord Evandale backed the auld leddy for
love o' her daughter Miss Edith, as the country said, ane o' the best and
bonniest lassies in Scotland.But they behuved to gie way, and Basil gat
the Castle and land, and on the back o' that came the Revolution, and wha
to turn coat faster than the laird?for he said he had been a true Whig
a' the time, and turned <DW7> only for fashion's sake.And then he got
favour, and Lord Evandale's head was under water; for he was ower proud
and manfu' to bend to every blast o' wind, though mony a ane may ken as
weel as me that be his ain principles as they might, he was nae ill
friend to our folk when he could protect us, and far kinder than Basil
Olifant, that aye keepit the cobble head doun the stream.But he was set
by and ill looked on, and his word ne'er asked; and then Basil, wha's a
revengefu' man, set himsell to vex him in a' shapes, and especially by
oppressing and despoiling the auld blind widow, Bessie Maclure, that
saved Lord Evandale's life, and that he was sae kind to.But he's mistaen
if that's his end; for it will be lang or Lord Evandale hears a word frae
me about the selling my kye for rent or e'er it was due, or the putting
the dragoons on me when the country's quiet, or onything else that will
vex him,--I can bear my ain burden patiently, and warld's loss is the
least part o't."Astonished and interested at this picture of patient, grateful, and
high-minded resignation, Morton could not help bestowing an execration
upon the poor-spirited rascal who had taken such a dastardly course of
vengeance."Dinna curse him, sir," said the old woman; "I have heard a good man say
that a curse was like a stone flung up to the heavens, and maist like to
return on the head that sent it.But if ye ken Lord Evandale, bid him
look to himsell, for I hear strange words pass atween the sodgers that
are lying here, and his name is often mentioned; and the tane o' them has
been twice up at Tillietudlem.He's a kind of favourite wi' the laird,
though he was in former times ane o' the maist cruel oppressors ever rade
through a country (out-taken Sergeant Bothwell),--they ca' him Inglis.""I have the deepest interest in Lord Evandale's safety," said Morton,
"and you may depend on my finding some mode to apprise him of these
suspicious circumstances.And, in return, my good friend, will you
indulge me with another question?Do you know anything of Quintin Mackell
of Irongray?"echoed the blind woman, in a tone of great surprise and
alarm."Quintin Mackell of Irongray," repeated Morton."Is there anything so
alarming in the sound of that name?""Na, na," answered the woman, with hesitation; "but to hear him asked
after by a stranger and a sodger,--Gude protect us, what mischief is
to come next!""None by my means, I assure you," said Morton; "the subject of my inquiry
has nothing to fear from me if, as I suppose, this Quintin Mackell is the
same with John Bal-----.""Do not mention his name," said the widow, pressing his lips with her
fingers."I see you have his secret and his pass-word, and I'll be free
wi' you.But, for God's sake, speak lound and low.In the name of Heaven,
I trust ye seek him not to his hurt!"I said truly; but one he has nothing to fear from.I commanded a party
at Bothwell Bridge.""And verily there is something in your voice I
can trust.Ye speak prompt and readily, and like an honest man.""I trust I am so," said Morton."But nae displeasure to you, sir, in thae waefu' times," continued Mrs.Maclure, "the hand of brother is against brother, and he fears as mickle
almaist frae this Government as e'er he did frae the auld persecutors."said Morton, in a tone of inquiry; "I was not aware of that.But
I am only just now returned from abroad.""I'll tell ye," said the blind woman, first assuming an attitude of
listening that showed how effectually her powers of collecting
intelligence had been transferred from the eye to the ear; for, instead
of casting a glance of circumspection around, she stooped her face, and
turned her head slowly around, in such a manner as to insure that there
was not the slightest sound stirring in the neighbourhood, and then
continued,--"I'll tell ye.Ye ken how he has laboured to raise up again
the Covenant, burned, broken, and buried in the hard hearts and selfish
devices of this stubborn people.Now, when he went to Holland, far from
the countenance and thanks of the great, and the comfortable fellowship
of the godly, both whilk he was in right to expect, the Prince of Orange
wad show him no favour, and the ministers no godly communion.This was
hard to bide for ane that had suffered and done mickle,--ower mickle, it
may be; but why suld I be a judge?He came back to me and to the auld
place o' refuge that had often received him in his distresses, mair
especially before the great day of victory at Drumclog, for I sail ne'er
forget how he was bending hither of a' nights in the year on that e'ening
after the play when young Milnwood wan the popinjay; but I warned him off
for that time."exclaimed Morton, "it was you that sat in your red cloak by the
high-road, and told him there was a lion in the path?"said the old woman, breaking off her
narrative in astonishment."But be wha ye may," she continued, resuming
it with tranquillity, "ye can ken naething waur o' me than that I hae
been willing to save the life o' friend and foe.""I know no ill of you, Mrs.Maclure, and I mean no ill by you; I only
wished to show you that I know so much of this person's affairs that I
might be safely intrusted with the rest.Proceed, if you please, in your
narrative.""There is a strange command in your voice," said the blind woman, "though
its tones are sweet.The Stewarts hae been
dethroned, and William and Mary reign in their stead; but nae mair word
of the Covenant than if it were a dead letter.They hae taen the indulged
clergy, and an Erastian General Assembly of the ante pure and triumphant
Kirk of Scotland, even into their very arms and bosoms.Our faithfu'
champions o' the testimony agree e'en waur wi' this than wi' the open
tyranny and apostasy of the persecuting times, for souls are hardened and
deadened, and the mouths of fasting multitudes are crammed wi' fizenless
bran instead of the sweet word in season; and mony an hungry, starving
creature, when he sits down on a Sunday forenoon to get something that
might warm him to the great work, has a dry clatter o' morality driven
about his lugs, and--"

"In short," said Morton, desirous to stop a discussion which the good old
woman, as enthusiastically attached to her religious profession as to the
duties of humanity, might probably have indulged longer,--"In short, you
are not disposed to acquiesce in this new government, and Burley is of
the same opinion?""Many of our brethren, sir, are of belief we fought for the Covenant, and
fasted and prayed and suffered for that grand national league, and now we
are like neither to see nor hear tell of that which we suffered and
fought and fasted and prayed for.And anes it was thought something might
be made by bringing back the auld family on a new bargain and a new
bottom, as, after a', when King James went awa, I understand the great
quarrel of the English against him was in behalf of seven unhallowed
prelates; and sae, though ae part of our people were free to join wi' the
present model, and levied an armed regiment under the Yerl of Angus, yet
our honest friend, and others that stude up for purity of doctrine and
freedom of conscience, were determined to hear the breath o' the
Jacobites before they took part again them, fearing to fa' to the ground
like a wall built with unslaked mortar, or from sitting between twa
stools.""They chose an odd quarter," said Morton, "from which to expect freedom
of conscience and purity of doctrine."said the landlady, "the natural day-spring rises in the
east, but the spiritual dayspring may rise in the north, for what we
blinded mortals ken.""And Burley went to the north to seek it?""Truly ay, sir; and he saw Claver'se himsell, that they ca' Dundee now."exclaimed Morton, in amazement; "I would have sworn that meeting
would have been the last of one of their lives.""Na, na, sir; in troubled times, as I understand," said Mrs.Maclure,
"there's sudden changes,--Montgomery and Ferguson and mony ane mair that
were King James's greatest faes are on his side now.Claver'se spake our
friend fair, and sent him to consult with Lord Evandale.But then there
was a break-off, for Lord Evandale wadna look at, hear, or speak wi' him;
and now he's anes wud and aye waur, and roars for revenge again Lord
Evandale, and will hear nought of onything but burn and slay.And oh,
thae starts o' passion!they unsettle his mind, and gie the Enemy sair
advantages."Are ye acquainted familiarly wi' John Balfour o' Burley, and
dinna ken that he has had sair and frequent combats to sustain against
the Evil One?Did ye ever see him alone but the Bible was in his hand,
and the drawn sword on his knee?Did ye never sleep in the same room wi'
him, and hear him strive in his dreams with the delusions of Satan?Oh,
ye ken little o' him if ye have seen him only in fair daylight; for nae
man can put the face upon his doleful visits and strifes that he can do.I hae seen him, after sic a strife of agony, tremble that an infant might
hae held him, while the hair on his brow was drapping as fast as ever my
puir thatched roof did in a heavy rain."As she spoke, Morton began to
recollect the appearance of Burley during his sleep in the hay-loft at
Milnwood, the report of Cuddie that his senses had become impaired, and
some whispers current among the Cameronians, who boasted frequently of
Burley's soul-exercises and his strifes with the foul fiend,--which
several circumstances led him to conclude that this man himself was a
victim to those delusions, though his mind, naturally acute and forcible,
not only disguised his superstition from those in whose opinion it might
have discredited his judgment, but by exerting such a force as is said to
be proper to those afflicted with epilepsy, could postpone the fits which
it occasioned until he was either freed from superintendence, or
surrounded by such as held him more highly on account of these
visitations.It was natural to suppose, and could easily be inferred from
the narrative of Mrs.Maclure, that disappointed ambition, wrecked hopes,
and the downfall of the party which he had served with such desperate
fidelity, were likely to aggravate enthusiasm into temporary insanity.It
was, indeed, no uncommon circumstance in those singular times that men
like Sir Harry Vane, Harrison, Overton, and others, themselves slaves to
the wildest and most enthusiastic dreams, could, when mingling with the
world, conduct themselves not only with good sense in difficulties, and
courage in dangers, but with the most acute sagacity and determined
valour.Maclure's information confirmed
Morton in these impressions."In the grey of the morning," she said, "my little Peggy sail show ye the
gate to him before the sodgers are up.But ye maun let his hour of
danger, as he ca's it, be ower, afore ye venture on him in his place of
refuge.Peggy will tell ye when to venture in.She kens his ways weel,
for whiles she carries him some little helps that he canna do
without to sustain life.""And in what retreat, then," said Morton, "has this unfortunate person
found refuge?""An awsome place," answered the blind woman, "as ever living creature
took refuge in; they ca it the Black Linn of Linklater.It's a doleful
place, but he loves it abune a' others, because he has sae often been in
safe hiding there; and it's my belief he prefers it to a tapestried
chamber and a down bed.I hae seen it mysell mony a day
syne.I was a daft hempie lassie then, and little thought what was to
come o't.--Wad ye choose ony thing, sir, ere ye betake yoursell to your
rest, for ye maun stir wi' the first dawn o' the grey light?""Nothing more, my good mother," said Morton; and they parted for the
evening.Morton recommended himself to Heaven, threw himself on the bed, heard,
between sleeping and waking, the trampling of the dragoon horses at the
riders' return from their patrol, and then slept soundly after such
painful agitation.The darksome cave they enter, where they found
               The accursed man low sitting on the ground,
               Musing full sadly in his sullen mind.As the morning began to appear on the mountains, a gentle knock was heard
at the door of the humble apartment in which Morton slept, and a girlish
treble voice asked him, from without, "If he wad please gang to the Linn
or the folk raise?"He arose upon the invitation, and, dressing himself hastily, went forth
and joined his little guide.The mountain maid tript lightly before him,
through the grey haze, over hill and moor.It was a wild and varied walk,
unmarked by any regular or distinguishable track, and keeping, upon the
whole, the direction of the ascent of the brook, though without tracing
its windings.The landscape, as they advanced, became waster and more
wild, until nothing but heath and rock encumbered the side of the valley."Nearly a mile off," answered
the girl."And do you often go this wild journey, my little maid?""When grannie sends me wi' milk and meal to the Linn," answered the
child."And are you not afraid to travel so wild a road alone?""Hout na, sir," replied the guide; "nae living creature wad touch sic a
bit thing as I am, and grannie says we need never fear onything else when
we are doing a gude turn."said Morton to himself, and
followed her steps in silence.They soon came to a decayed thicket, where brambles and thorns supplied
the room of the oak and birches of which it had once consisted.Here the
guide turned short off the open heath, and, by a sheep-track, conducted
Morton to the brook.A hoarse and sullen roar had in part prepared him
for the scene which presented itself, yet it was not to be viewed without
surprise and even terror.When he emerged from the devious path which
conducted him through the thicket, he found himself placed on a ledge of
flat rock projecting over one side of a chasm not less than a hundred
feet deep, where the dark mountain-stream made a decided and rapid shoot
over the precipice, and was swallowed up by a deep, black, yawning gulf.The eye in vain strove to see the bottom of the fall; it could catch but
one sheet of foaming uproar and sheer descent, until the view was
obstructed by the proecting crags which enclosed the bottom of the
waterfall, and hid from sight the dark pool which received its tortured
waters; far beneath, at the distance of perhaps a quarter of a mile, the
eye caught the winding of the stream as it emerged into a more open
course.But, for that distance, they were lost to sight as much as if a
cavern had been arched over them; and indeed the steep and projecting
ledges of rock through which they wound their way in darkness were very
nearly closing and over-roofing their course.While Morton gazed at this scene of tumult, which seemed, by the
surrounding thickets and the clefts into which the waters descended, to
seek to hide itself from every eye, his little attendant as she stood
beside him on the platform of rock which commanded the best view of the
fall, pulled him by the sleeve, and said, in a tone which he could not
hear without stooping his ear near the speaker, "Hear till him!Morton listened more attentively; and out of the very abyss into which
the brook fell, and amidst the turnultuary sounds of the cataract,
thought he could distinguish shouts, screams, and even articulate words,
as if the tortured demon of the stream had been mingling his complaints
with the roar of his broken waters."This is the way," said the little girl; "follow me, gin ye please, sir,
but tak tent to your feet;" and, with the daring agility which custom had
rendered easy, she vanished from the platform on which she stood, and, by
notches and slight projections in the rock, scrambled down its face into
the chasm which it overhung.Steady, bold, and active, Morton hesitated
not to follow her; but the necessary attention to secure his hold and
footing in a descent where both foot and hand were needful for security,
prevented him from looking around him, till, having descended nigh twenty
feet, and being sixty or seventy above the pool which received the fall,
his guide made a pause, and he again found himself by her side in a
situation that appeared equally romantic and precarious.They were nearly
opposite to the waterfall, and in point of level situated at about
one-quarter's depth from the point of the cliff over which it thundered,
and three-fourths of the height above the dark, deep, and restless pool
which received its fall.Both these tremendous points--the first shoot,
namely, of the yet unbroken stream, and the deep and sombre abyss into
which it was emptied--were full before him, as well as the whole
continuous stream of billowy froth, which, dashing from the one, was
eddying and boiling in the other.They were so near this grand phenomenon
that they were covered with its spray, and well-nigh deafened by the
incessant roar.But crossing in the very front of the fall, and at scarce
three yards distance from the cataract, an old oak-tree, flung across the
chasm in a manner that seemed accidental, formed a bridge of fearfully
narrow dimensions and uncertain footing.The upper end of the tree rested
on the platform on which they stood; the lower or uprooted extremity
extended behind a projection on the opposite side, and was secured,
Morton's eye could not discover where.From behind the same projection
glimmered a strong red light, which, glancing in the waves of the falling
water, and tinging them partially with crimson, had a strange
preternatural and sinister effect when contrasted with the beams of the
rising sun, which glanced on the first broken waves of the fall, though
even its meridian splendour could not gain the third of its full depth.When he had looked around him for a moment, the girl again pulled his
sleeve, and, pointing to the oak and the projecting point beyond it (for
hearing speech was now out of the question), indicated that there lay his
farther passage.Morton gazed at her with surprise; for although he well knew that the
persecuted Presbyterians had in the preceding reigns sought refuge among
dells and thickets, caves and cataracts, in spots the most extraordinary
and secluded; although he had heard of the champions of the Covenant, who
had long abidden beside Dobs-lien on the wild heights of Polmoodie, and
others who had been concealed in the yet more terrific cavern called
Creehope-linn, in the parish of Closeburn,--yet his imagination had never
exactly figured out the horrors of such a residence, and he was surprised
how the strange and romantic scene which he now saw had remained
concealed from him, while a curious investigator of such natural
phenomena.But he readily conceived that, lying in a remote and wild
district, and being destined as a place of concealment to the persecuted
preachers and professors of nonconformity, the secret of its existence
was carefully preserved by the few shepherds to whom it might be known.As, breaking from these meditations, he began to consider how he should
traverse the doubtful and terrific bridge, which, skirted by the cascade,
and rendered wet and slippery by its constant drizzle, traversed the
chasm above sixty feet from the bottom of the fall, his guide, as if to
give him courage, tript over and back without the least hesitation.Envying for a moment the little bare feet which caught a safer hold of
the rugged side of the oak than he could pretend to with his heavy boots,
Morton nevertheless resolved to attempt the passage, and, fixing his eye
firm on a stationary object on the other side, without allowing his head
to become giddy, or his attention to be distracted by the flash, the
foam, and the roar of the waters around him, he strode steadily and
safely along the uncertain bridge, and reached the mouth of a small
cavern on the farther side of the torrent.Here he paused; for a light,
proceeding from a fire of red-hot charcoal, permitted him to see the
interior of the cave, and enabled him to contemplate the appearance of
its inhabitant, by whom he himself could not be so readily distinguished,
being concealed by the shadow of the rock.What he observed would by no
means have encouraged a less determined man to proceed with the task
which he had undertaken.Burley, only altered from what he had been formerly by the addition of a
grisly beard, stood in the midst of the cave, with his clasped Bible in
one hand, and his drawn sword in the other.His figure, dimly ruddied by
the light of the red charcoal, seemed that of a fiend in the lurid
atmosphere of Pandemonium, and his gestures and words, as far as they
could be heard, seemed equally violent and irregular.All alone, and in a
place of almost unapproachable seclusion, his demeanour was that of
a man who strives for life and death with a mortal enemy.he exclaimed, accompanying each word with a thrust,
urged with his whole force against the impassible and empty air, "Did I
not tell thee so?--I have resisted, and thou fleest from me!--Coward as
thou art, come in all thy terrors; come with mine own evil deeds, which
render thee most terrible of all,--there is enough betwixt the boards of
this book to rescue me!--What mutterest thou of grey hairs?It was well
done to slay him,--the more ripe the corn, the readier for the sickle.--
Art gone?Art gone?--I have ever known thee but a coward--ha!With these wild exclamations he sunk the point of his sword, and remained
standing still in the same posture, like a maniac whose fit is over."The dangerous time is by now," said the little girl who had followed;
"it seldom lasts beyond the time that the sun's ower the hill; ye may
gang in and speak wi' him now.I'll wait for you at the other side of the
linn; he canna bide to see twa folk at anes."Slowly and cautiously, and keeping constantly upon his guard, Morton
presented himself to the view of his old associate in command.comest thou again when thine hour is over?"was his first
exclamation; and flourishing his sword aloft, his countenance assumed an
expression in which ghastly terror seemed mingled with the rage of a
demoniac.Balfour," said Morton, in a steady and composed tone,
"to renew an acquaintance which has been broken off since the fight of
Bothwell Bridge."As soon as Burley became aware that Morton was before him in person,--an
idea which he caught with marvellous celerity,--he at once exerted that
mastership over his heated and enthusiastic imagination, the power of
enforcing which was a most striking part of his extraordinary character.He sunk his sword-point at once, and as he stole it composedly into the
scabbard, he muttered something of the damp and cold which sent an old
soldier to his fencing exercise, to prevent his blood from chilling.This
done, he proceeded in the cold, determined manner which was peculiar to
his ordinary discourse:--

"Thou hast tarried long, Henry Morton, and hast not come to the vintage
before the twelfth hour has struck.Art thou yet willing to take the
right hand of fellowship, and be one with those who look not to thrones
or dynasties, but to the rule of Scripture, for their directions?"[Illustration: Morton and Black Linn--272]


"I am surprised," said Morton, evading the direct answer to his question,
"that you should have known me after so many years.""The features of those who ought to act with me are engraved on my
heart," answered Burley; "and few but Silas Morton's son durst have
followed me into this my castle of retreat.Seest thou that drawbridge of
Nature's own construction?"he added, pointing to the prostrate
oak-tree,--"one spurn of my foot, and it is overwhelmed in the abyss
below, bidding foeman on the farther side stand at defiance, and leaving
enemies on this at the mercy of one who never yet met his equal in single
fight.""Of such defences," said Morton, "I should have thought you would now
have had little need.""What little need, when incarnate
fiends are combined against me on earth, and Sathan himself--But it
matters not," added he, checking himself."Enough that I like my place
of refuge, my cave of Adullam, and would not change its rude ribs of
limestone rock for the fair chambers of the castle of the earls of
Torwood, with their broad bounds and barony.Thou, unless the foolish
fever-fit be over, mayst think differently.""It was of those very possessions I came to speak," said Morton; "and I
doubt not to find Mr.Balfour the same rational and reflecting person
which I knew him to be in times when zeal disunited brethren.""In a word, then," said Morton, "you have exercised, by means at which I
can guess, a secret, but most prejudicial, influence over the fortunes of
Lady Margaret Bellenden and her granddaughter, and in favour of that
base, oppressive apostate, Basil Olifant, whom the law, deceived by thy
operations, has placed in possession of their lawful property.""I do say so," replied Morton; "and face to face you will not deny what
you have vouched by your handwriting.""And suppose I deny it not," said Balfour; "and suppose that
thy--eloquence were found equal to persuade me to retrace the steps I
have taken on matured resolve,--what will be thy meed?Dost thou still
hope to possess the fair-haired girl, with her wide and rich
inheritance?""I have no such hope," answered Morton, calmly."And for whom, then, hast thou ventured to do this great thing,--to seek
to rend the prey from the valiant, to bring forth food from the den of
the lion, and to extract sweetness from the maw of the devourer?For
whose sake hast thou undertaken to read this riddle, more hard than
Samson's?""For Lord Evandale's and that of his bride," replied Morton, firmly.Balfour, and believe there are some who are
willing to sacrifice their happiness to that of others.""Then, as my soul liveth," replied Balfour, "thou art, to wear beard and
back a horse and draw a sword, the tamest and most gall-less puppet that
ever sustained injury unavenged.thou wouldst help that accursed
Evandale to the arms of the woman that thou lovest; thou wouldst endow
them with wealth and with heritages, and thou think'st that there lives
another man, offended even more deeply than thou, yet equally
cold-livered and mean-spirited, crawling upon the face of the earth,
and hast dared to suppose that one other to be John Balfour?""For my own feelings," said Morton, composedly, "I am answerable to none
but Heaven; to you, Mr.Balfour, I should suppose it of little
consequence whether Basil Olifant or Lord Evandale possess these
estates.""Thou art deceived," said Burley; "both are indeed in outer darkness,
and strangers to the light, as he whose eyes have never been opened to
the day.But this Basil Olifant is a Nabal, a Demas, a base churl whose
wealth and power are at the disposal of him who can threaten to deprive
him of them.He became a professor because he was deprived of these lands
of Tillietudlem; he turned a <DW7> to obtain possession of them; he
called himself an Erastian, that he might not again lose them; and he
will become what I list while I have in my power the document that may
deprive him of them.These lands are a bit between his jaws and a hook in
his nostrils, and the rein and the line are in my hands to guide them as
I think meet; and his they shall therefore be, unless I had assurance of
bestowing them on a sure and sincere friend.But Lord Evandale is a
malignant, of heart like flint, and brow like adamant; the goods of the
world fall on him like leaves on the frost-bound earth, and unmoved he
will see them whirled off by the first wind.The heathen virtues of such
as he are more dangerous to us than the sordid cupidity of those who,
governed by their interest, must follow where it leads, and who,
therefore, themselves the slaves of avarice, may be compelled to work
in the vineyard, were it but to earn the wages of sin.""This might have been all well some years since," replied Morton, "and I
could understand your argument, although I could never acquiesce in its
justice.But at this crisis it seems useless to you to persevere in
keeping up an influence which can no longer be directed to an useful
purpose.The land has peace, liberty, and freedom of conscience,--and
what would you more?"exclaimed Burley, again unsheathing his sword, with a vivacity
which nearly made Morton start."Look at the notches upon that weapon
they are three in number, are they not?""It seems so," answered Morton; "but what of that?""The fragment of steel that parted from this first gap rested on the
skull of the perjured traitor who first introduced Episcopacy into
Scotland; this second notch was made in the rib-bone of an impious
villain, the boldest and best soldier that upheld the prelatic cause at
Drumclog; this third was broken on the steel head-piece of the captain
who defended the Chapel of Holyrood when the people rose at the
Revolution.I cleft him to the teeth, through steel and bone.It has done
great deeds, this little weapon, and each of these blows was a
deliverance to the Church.This sword," he said, again sheathing it,
"has yet more to do,--to weed out this base and pestilential heresy of
Erastianism; to vindicate the true liberty of the Kirk in her purity;
to restore the Covenant in its glory,--then let it moulder and rust
beside the bones of its master.""You have neither men nor means, Mr.Balfour, to disturb the Government
as now settled," argued Morton; "the people are in general satisfied,
excepting only the gentlemen of the Jacobite interest; and surely you
would not join with those who would only use you for their own purposes?""It is they," answered Burley, "that should serve ours.I went to the
camp of the malignant Claver'se, as the future King of Israel sought the
land of the Philistines; I arranged with him a rising; and but for the
villain Evandale, the Erastians ere now had been driven from the West.--
I could slay him," he added, with a vindictive scowl, "were he grasping
the horns of the altar!"He then proceeded in a calmer tone: "If thou,
son of mine ancient comrade, were suitor for thyself to this Edith
Bellenden, and wert willing to put thy hand to the great work with zeal
equal to thy courage, think not I would prefer the friendship of Basil
Olifant to thine; thou shouldst then have the means that this document
[he produced a parchment] affords to place her in possession of the lands
of her fathers.This have I longed to say to thee ever since I saw thee
fight the good fight so strongly at the fatal Bridge.The maiden loved
thee, and thou her."Morton replied firmly, "I will not dissemble with you, Mr.Balfour, even
to gain a good end.I came in hopes to persuade you to do a deed of
justice to others, not to gain any selfish end of my own.I have failed;
I grieve for your sake more than for the loss which others will sustain
by your injustice.""Would you be really, as you are desirous to be
thought, a man of honour and conscience, you would, regardless of all
other considerations, restore that parchment to Lord Evandale, to be used
for the advantage of the lawful heir."said Balfour; and, casting the deed into the
heap of red charcoal beside him, pressed it down with the heel of his
boot.While it smoked, shrivelled, and crackled in the flames, Morton sprung
forward to snatch it, and Burley catching hold of him, a struggle ensued.Both were strong men; but although Morton was much the more active and
younger of the two, yet Balfour was the most powerful, and effectually
prevented him from rescuing the deed until it was fairly reduced to a
cinder.They then quitted hold of each other, and the enthusiast,
rendered fiercer by the contest, glared on Morton with an eye expressive
of frantic revenge."Thou hast my secret," he exclaimed; "thou must be mine, or die!""I contemn your threats," said Morton; "I pity you, and leave you."But as he turned to retire, Burley stept before him, pushed the oak-trunk
from its resting place, and as it fell thundering and crashing into the
abyss beneath, drew his sword, and cried out, with a voice that rivalled
the roar of the cataract and the thunder of the falling oak, "Now thou
art at bay!and standing in the mouth of the
cavern, he flourished his naked sword."I will not fight with the man that preserved my father's life," said
Morton."I have not yet learned to say the words, 'I yield;' and my life
I will rescue as I best can."So speaking, and ere Balfour was aware of his purpose, he sprung past
him, and exerting that youthful agility of which he possessed an uncommon
share, leaped clear across the fearful chasm which divided the mouth of
the cave from the projecting rock on the opposite side, and stood there
safe and free from his incensed enemy.He immediately ascended the
ravine, and, as he turned, saw Burley stand for an instant aghast with
astonishment, and then, with the frenzy of disappointed rage, rush into
the interior of his cavern.It was not difficult for him to perceive that this unhappy man's mind had
been so long agitated by desperate schemes and sudden disappointments
that it had lost its equipoise, and that there was now in his conduct a
shade of lunacy, not the less striking, from the vigour and craft with
which he pursued his wild designs.Morton soon joined his guide, who had
been terrified by the fall of the oak.This he represented as accidental;
and she assured him, in return, that the inhabitant of the cave would
experience no inconvenience from it, being always provided with materials
to construct another bridge.The adventures of the morning were not yet ended.As they approached the
hut, the little girl made an exclamation of surprise at seeing her
grandmother groping her way towards them, at a greater distance from her
home than she could have been supposed capable of travelling.said the old woman, when she heard them approach, "gin
e'er ye loved Lord Evandale, help now, or never!God be praised that left
my hearing when he took my poor eyesight!Peggy, hinny, gang saddle the gentleman's horse, and
lead him cannily ahint the thorny shaw, and bide him there."She conducted him to a small window, through which, himself unobserved,
he could see two dragoons seated at their morning draught of ale, and
conversing earnestly together."The more I think of it," said the one, "the less I like it, Inglis;
Evandale was a good officer and the soldier's friend; and though we were
punished for the mutiny at Tillietudlem, yet, by ---, Frank, you must own
we deserved it.""D--n seize me if I forgive him for it, though!"replied the other; "and
I think I can sit in his skirts now.""Why, man, you should forget and forgive.Better take the start with him
along with the rest, and join the ranting Highlanders.We have all eat
King James's bread.""Thou art an ass; the start, as you call it, will never happen,--the
day's put off.Halliday's seen a ghost, or Miss Bellenden's fallen sick
of the pip, or some blasted nonsense or another; the thing will never
keep two days longer, and the first bird that sings out will get the
reward.""That's true too," answered his comrade; "and will this fellow--this
Basil Olifant--pay handsomely?""Like a prince, man," said Inglis."Evandale is the man on earth whom he
hates worst, and he fears him, besides, about some law business; and were
he once rubbed out of the way, all, he thinks, will be his own.""But shall we have warrants and force enough?""Few people here will stir against my lord, and we may find him with some
of our own fellows at his back.""Thou 'rt a cowardly fool, Dick," returned Inglis; "he is living quietly
down at Fairy Knowe to avoid suspicion.Olifant is a magistrate, and will
have some of his own people that he can trust along with him.There are
us two, and the laird says he can get a desperate fighting Whig fellow,
called Quintin Mackell, that has an old grudge at Evandale.""Well, well, you are my officer, you know," said the private, with true
military conscience, "and if anything is wrong--"

"I'll take the blame," said Inglis."Come, another pot of ale, and let us
to Tillietudlem.--Here, blind Bess!--Why, where the devil has the old hag
crept to?""Delay them as long as you can," whispered Morton, as he thrust his purse
into the hostess's hand; "all depends on gaining time."Then, walking swiftly to the place where the girl held his horse ready,
"To Fairy Knowe?Wittenbold, the commandant there, will readily give me the
support of a troop, and procure me the countenance of the civil power.I
must drop a caution as I pass.--Come, Moorkopf," he said, addressing his
horse as he mounted him, "this day must try your breath and speed."Yet could he not his closing eyes withdraw,
          Though less and less of Emily he saw;
          So, speechless for a little space he lay,
          Then grasp'd the hand he held, and sigh'd his soul away.The indisposition of Edith confined her to bed during the eventful day on
which she had received such an unexpected shock from the sudden
apparition of Morton.Next morning, however, she was reported to be so
much better that Lord Evandale resumed his purpose of leaving Fairy
Knowe.At a late hour in the forenoon Lady Emily entered the apartment of
Edith with a peculiar gravity of manner.Having received and paid the
compliments of the day, she observed it would be a sad one for her,
though it would relieve Miss Bellenden of an encumbrance: "My brother
leaves us today, Miss Bellenden."exclaimed Edith, in surprise; "for his own house, I trust?""I have reason to think he meditates a more distant journey," answered
Lady Emily; "he has little to detain him in this country."exclaimed Edith, "why was I born to become the wreck of
all that is manly and noble!What can be done to stop him from running
headlong on ruin?I will come down instantly.--Say that I implore he will
not depart until I speak with him.""It will be in vain, Miss Bellenden; but I will execute your commission;"
and she left the room as formally as she had entered it, and informed her
brother Miss Bellenden was so much recovered as to propose coming
downstairs ere he went away."I suppose," she added pettishly, "the prospect of being speedily
released from our company has wrought a cure on her shattered nerves.""Sister," said Lord Evandale, "you are unjust, if not envious.""Unjust I maybe, Evandale, but I should not have dreamt," glancing her
eye at a mirror, "of being thought envious without better cause.But let
us go to the old lady; she is making a feast in the other room which
might have dined all your troop when you had one."Lord Evandale accompanied her in silence to the parlour, for he knew it
was in vain to contend with her prepossessions and offended pride.They
found the table covered with refreshments, arranged under the careful
inspection of Lady Margaret."Ye could hardly weel be said to breakfast this morning, my Lord
Evandale, and ye maun e'en partake of a small collation before ye ride,
such as this poor house, whose inmates are so much indebted to you, can
provide in their present circumstances.For my ain part, I like to see
young folk take some refection before they ride out upon their sports or
their affairs, and I said as much to his most sacred Majesty when he
breakfasted at Tillietudlem in the year of grace sixteen hundred and
fifty-one; and his most sacred Majesty was pleased to reply, drinking to
my health at the same time in a flagon of Rhenish wine, 'Lady Margaret,
ye speak like a Highland oracle.'These were his Majesty's very words;
so that your lordship may judge whether I have not good authority to
press young folk to partake of their vivers."It may be well supposed that much of the good lady's speech failed Lord
Evandale's ears, which were then employed in listening for the light step
of Edith.His absence of mind on this occasion, however natural, cost him
very dear.While Lady Margaret was playing the kind hostess,--a part she
delighted and excelled in,--she was interrupted by John Gudyill, who, in
the natural phrase for announcing an inferior to the mistress of a
family, said, "There was ane wanting to speak to her leddyship."Ye speak as if I kept a shop, and was to
come at everybody's whistle.""Yes, he has a name," answered John, "but your leddyship likes ill to
hear't.""It's Calf-Gibbie, my leddy," said John, in a tone rather above the pitch
of decorous respect, on which he occasionally trespassed, confiding in
his merit as an ancient servant of the family and a faithful follower of
their humble fortunes,--"It's Calf-Gibbie, an your leddyship will hae't,
that keeps Edie Henshaw's kye down yonder at the Brigg-end,--that's him
that was Guse-Gibbie at Tillietudlem, and gaed to the wappinshaw, and
that--"

"Hold your peace, John," said the old lady, rising in dignity; "you are
very insolent to think I wad speak wi' a person like that.Let him tell
his business to you or Mrs."He'll no hear o' that, my leddy; he says them that sent him bade him gie
the thing to your leddyship's ain hand direct, or to Lord Evandale's, he
wots na whilk.But, to say the truth, he's far frae fresh, and he's but
an idiot an he were.""Then turn him out," said Lady Margaret, "and tell him to come back
to-morrow when he is sober.I suppose he comes to crave some benevolence,
as an ancient follower o' the house.""Like eneugh, my leddy, for he's a' in rags, poor creature."Gudyill made another attempt to get at Gibbie's commission, which was
indeed of the last importance, being a few lines from Morton to Lord
Evandale, acquainting him with the danger in which he stood from the
practices of Olifant, and exhorting him either to instant flight, or else
to come to Glasgow and surrender himself, where he could assure him of
protection.This billet, hastily written, he intrusted to Gibbie, whom he
saw feeding his herd beside the bridge, and backed with a couple of
dollars his desire that it might instantly be delivered into the hand to
which it was addressed.But it was decreed that Goose-Gibbie's intermediation, whether as an
emissary or as a man-at-arms, should be unfortunate to the family of
Tillietudlem.He unluckily tarried so long at the ale-house to prove if
his employer's coin was good that, when he appeared at Fairy Knowe, the
little sense which nature had given him was effectually drowned in ale
and brandy; and instead of asking for Lord Evandale, he demanded to speak
with Lady Margaret, whose name was more familiar to his ear.Being
refused admittance to her presence, he staggered away with the letter
undelivered, perversely faithful to Morton's instructions in the only
point in which it would have been well had he departed from them.A few minutes after he was gone, Edith entered the apartment.Lord
Evandale and she met with mutual embarrassment, which Lady Margaret, who
only knew in general that their union had been postponed by her
granddaughter's indisposition, set down to the bashfulness of a bride and
bridegroom, and, to place them at ease, began to talk to Lady Emily on
indifferent topics.At this moment Edith, with a countenance as pale as
death, muttered, rather than whispered, to Lord Evandale a request to
speak with him.He offered his arm, and supported her into the small
ante-room, which, as we have noticed before, opened from the parlour.He
placed her in a chair, and, taking one himself, awaited the opening of
the conversation."I am distressed, my lord," were the first words she was able to
articulate, and those with difficulty; "I scarce know what I would say,
nor how to speak it.""If I have any share in occasioning your uneasiness," said Lord Evandale,
mildly, "you will soon, Edith, be released from it.""You are determined then, my lord," she replied, "to run this desperate
course with desperate men, in spite of your own better reason, in spite
of your friends' entreaties, in spite of the almost inevitable ruin which
yawns before you?""Forgive me, Miss Bellenden; even your solicitude on my account must not
detain me when my honour calls.My horses stand ready saddled, my
servants are prepared, the signal for rising will be given so soon as I
reach Kilsyth.If it is my fate that calls me, I will not shun meeting
it.It will be something," he said, taking her hand, "to die deserving
your compassion, since I cannot gain your love."said Edith, in a tone which went to his heart;
"time may explain the strange circumstance which has shocked me so much;
my agitated nerves may recover their tranquillity.Oh, do not rush on
death and ruin!remain to be our prop and stay, and hope everything from
time!""It is too late, Edith," answered Lord Evandale; "and I were most
ungenerous could I practise on the warmth and kindliness of your feelings
towards me.I know you cannot love me; nervous distress, so strong as to
conjure up the appearance of the dead or absent, indicates a predilection
too powerful to give way to friendship and gratitude alone.But were it
otherwise, the die is now cast."As he spoke thus, Cuddie burst into the room, terror and haste in his
countenance."Oh, my lord, hide yoursell!they hae beset the outlets o'
the house," was his first exclamation."A party of horse, headed by Basil Olifant," answered Cuddie.echoed Edith, in an agony of terror."What right has the
villain to assail me or stop my passage?I will make my way, were he
backed by a regiment; tell Halliday and Hunter to get out the horses.--
And now, farewell, Edith!"He clasped her in his arms, and kissed her
tenderly; then, bursting from his sister, who, with Lady Margaret,
endeavoured to detain him, rushed out and mounted his horse.All was in confusion; the women shrieked and hurried in consternation to
the front windows of the house, from which they could see a small party
of horsemen, of whom two only seemed soldiers.They were on the open
ground before Cuddie's cottage, at the bottom of the descent from the
house, and showed caution in approaching it, as if uncertain of the
strength within.said Edith; "oh, would he but take the
by-road!"But Lord Evandale, determined to face a danger which his high spirit
undervalued, commanded his servants to follow him, and rode composedly
down the avenue.Old Gudyill ran to arm himself, and Cuddie snatched down
a gun which was kept for the protection of the house, and, although on
foot, followed Lord Evandale.It was in vain his wife, who had hurried up
on the alarm, hung by his skirts, threatening him with death by the sword
or halter for meddling with other folk's matters."Hand your peace, ye b----," said Cuddie; "and that's braid Scotch, or I
wotna what is.Is it ither folk's matters to see Lord Evandale murdered
before my face?"But considering on the
way that he composed the whole infantry, as John Gudyill had not
appeared, he took his vantage ground behind the hedge, hammered his
flint, cocked his piece, and, taking a long aim at Laird Basil, as he was
called, stood prompt for action.As soon as Lord Evandale appeared, Olifant's party spread themselves a
little, as if preparing to enclose him.Their leader stood fast,
supported by three men, two of whom were dragoons, the third in dress and
appearance a countryman, all well armed.But the strong figure, stern
features, and resolved manner of the third attendant made him seem the
most formidable of the party; and whoever had before seen him could have
no difficulty in recognising Balfour of Burley."Follow me," said Lord Evandale to his servants, "and if we are forcibly
opposed, do as I do."He advanced at a hand gallop towards Olifant, and
was in the act of demanding why he had thus beset the road, when Olifant
called out, "Shoot the traitor!"and the whole four fired their carabines
upon the unfortunate nobleman.He reeled in the saddle, advanced his
hand to the holster, and drew a pistol, but, unable to discharge it, fell
from his horse mortally wounded.His servants had presented their
carabines.Hunter fired at random; but Halliday, who was an intrepid
fellow, took aim at Inglis, and shot him dead on the spot.At the same
instant a shot from behind the hedge still more effectually avenged Lord
Evandale, for the ball took place in the very midst of Basil Olifant's
forehead, and stretched him lifeless on the ground.His followers,
astonished at the execution done in so short a time, seemed rather
disposed to stand inactive, when Burley, whose blood was up with the
contest, exclaimed, "Down with the Midianites!"At this instant the clatter of horses' hoofs was heard,
and a party of horse, rapidly advancing on the road from Glasgow,
appeared on the fatal field.They were foreign dragoons, led by the Dutch
commandant Wittenbold, accompanied by Morton and a civil magistrate.A hasty call to surrender, in the name of God and King William, was
obeyed by all except Burley, who turned his horse and attempted to
escape.Several soldiers pursued him by command of their officer, but,
being well mounted, only the two headmost seemed likely to gain on him.He turned deliberately twice, and discharging first one of his pistols,
and then the other, rid himself of the one pursuer by mortally wounding
him, and of the other by shooting his horse, and then continued his
flight to Bothwell Bridge, where, for his misfortune, he found the gates
shut and guarded.Turning from thence, he made for a place where the
river seemed passable, and plunged into the stream, the bullets from the
pistols and carabines of his pursuers whizzing around him.Two balls took
effect when he was past the middle of the stream, and he felt himself
dangerously wounded.He reined his horse round in the midst of the river,
and returned towards the bank he had left, waving his hand, as if with
the purpose of intimating that he surrendered.The troopers ceased firing
at him accordingly, and awaited his return, two of them riding a little
way into the river to seize and disarm him.But it presently appeared
that his purpose was revenge, not safety.As he approached the two
soldiers, he collected his remaining strength, and discharged a blow on
the head of one, which tumbled him from his horse.The other dragoon, a
strong, muscular man, had in the mean while laid hands on him.Burley, in
requital, grasped his throat, as a dying tiger seizes his prey, and both,
losing the saddle in the struggle, came headlong into the river, and were
swept down the stream.Their course might be traced by the blood which
bubbled up to the surface.They were twice seen to rise, the Dutchman
striving to swim, and Burley clinging to him in a manner that showed his
desire that both should perish.Their corpses were taken out about a
quarter of a mile down the river.As Balfour's grasp could not have been
unclenched without cutting off his hands, both were thrown into a hasty
grave, still marked by a rude stone and a ruder epitaph.[Gentle reader, I did request of mine honest friend Peter Proudfoot,
     travelling merchant, known to many of this land for his faithful and
     just dealings, as well in muslins and cambrics as in small wares, to
     procure me on his next peregrinations to that vicinage, a copy of
     the Epitaphion alluded to.And, according to his report, which I see
     no ground to discredit, it runneth thus:--

               Here lyes ane saint to prelates surly,
               Being John Balfour, sometime of Burley,
               Who stirred up to vengeance take,
               For Solemn League and Cov'nant's sake,
               Upon the Magus-Moor in Fife,
               Did tak James Sharpe the apostate's life;
               By Dutchman's hands was hacked and shot,
               Then drowned in Clyde near this saam spot.]While the soul of this stern enthusiast flitted to its account, that of
the brave and generous Lord Evandale was also released.Morton had flung
himself from his horse upon perceiving his situation, to render his dying
friend all the aid in his power.He knew him, for he pressed his hand,
and, being unable to speak, intimated by signs his wish to be conveyed to
the house.This was done with all the care possible, and he was soon
surrounded by his lamenting friends.But the clamorous grief of Lady
Emily was far exceeded in intensity by the silent agony of Edith.Unconscious even of the presence of Morton, she hung over the dying man;
nor was she aware that Fate, who was removing one faithful lover, had
restored another as if from the grave, until Lord Evandale, taking their
hands in his, pressed them both affectionately, united them together,
raised his face as if to pray for a blessing on them, and sunk back and
expired in the next moment.I had determined to waive the task of a concluding chapter, leaving to
the reader's imagination the arrangements which must necessarily take
place after Lord Evandale's death.But as I was aware that precedents are
wanting for a practice which might be found convenient both to readers
and compilers, I confess myself to have been in a considerable dilemma,
when fortunately I was honoured with an invitation to drink tea with Miss
Martha Buskbody, a young lady who has carried on the profession of
mantua-making at Ganderscleugh and in the neighbourhood, with great
success, for about forty years.Knowing her taste for narratives of this
description, I requested her to look over the loose sheets the morning
before I waited on her, and enlighten me by the experience which she must
have acquired in reading through the whole stock of three circulating
libraries, in Ganderscleugh and the two next market-towns.When, with a
palpitating heart, I appeared before her in the evening, I found her much
disposed to be complimentary."I have not been more affected," said she, wiping the glasses of her
spectacles, "by any novel, excepting the 'Tale of Jemmy and Jenny
Jessamy', which is indeed pathos itself; but your plan of omitting a
formal conclusion will never do.You may be as harrowing to our nerves as
you will in the course of your story, but, unless you had the genius
of the author of 'Julia de Roubignd,' never let the end be altogether
overclouded.Let us see a glimpse of sunshine in the last chapter; it is
quite essential.""Nothing would be more easy for me, madam, than to comply with your
injunctions; for, in truth, the parties in whom you have had the goodness
to be interested, did live long and happily, and begot sons and
daughters.""It is unnecessary, sir," she said, with a slight nod of reprimand, "to
be particular concerning their matrimonial comforts.But what is your
objection to let us have, in a general way, a glimpse of their future
felicity?""Really, madam," said I, "you must be aware that every volume of a
narrative turns less and less interesting as the author draws to a
conclusion,--just like your tea, which, though excellent hyson, is
necessarily weaker and more insipid in the last cup.Now, as I think the
one is by no means improved by the luscious lump of half-dissolved sugar
usually found at the bottom of it, so I am of opinion that a history,
growing already vapid, is but dully crutched up by a detail of
circumstances which every reader must have anticipated, even though the
author exhaust on them every flowery epithet in the language."Pattieson," continued the lady; "you have, as I
may say, basted up your first story very hastily and clumsily at the
conclusion; and, in my trade, I would have cuffed the youngest apprentice
who had put such a horrid and bungled spot of work out of her hand.And
if you do not redeem this gross error by telling us all about the
marriage of Morton and Edith, and what became of the other personages of
the story, from Lady Margaret down to Goose-Gibbie, I apprise you that
you will not be held to have accomplished your task handsomely.""Well, madam," I replied, "my materials are so ample that I think I can
satisfy your curiosity, unless it descend to very minute circumstances
indeed.""First, then," said she, "for that is most essential,--Did Lady Margaret
get back her fortune and her castle?""She did, madam, and in the easiest way imaginable, as heir, namely, to
her worthy cousin, Basil Olifant, who died without a will; and thus, by
his death, not only restored, but even augmented, the fortune of her,
whom, during his life, he had pursued with the most inveterate malice.John Gudyill, reinstated in his dignity, was more important than ever;
and Cuddie, with rapturous delight, entered upon the cultivation of the
mains of Tillietudlem, and the occupation of his original cottage.But,
with the shrewd caution of his character, he was never heard to boast of
having fired the lucky shot which repossessed his lady and himself in
their original habitations.'After a',' he said to Jenny, who was his
only confidant, 'auld Basil Olifant was my leddy's cousin and a grand
gentleman; and though he was acting again the law, as I understand, for
he ne'er showed ony warrant, or required Lord Evandale to surrender, and
though I mind killing him nae mair than I wad do a muircock, yet it's
just as weel to keep a calm sough about it.'He not only did so, but
ingeniously enough countenanced a report that old Gudyill had done the
deed,--which was worth many a gill of brandy to him from the old butler,
who, far different in disposition from Cuddie, was much more inclined to
exaggerate than suppress his exploits of manhood.The blind widow was
provided for in the most comfortable manner, as well as the little guide
to the Linn; and--"

"But what is all this to the marriage,--the marriage of the principal
personages?"interrupted Miss Buskbody, impatiently tapping her
snuff-box."The marriage of Morton and Miss Bellenden was delayed for several
months, as both went into deep mourning on account of Lord Evandale's
death."I hope not without Lady Margaret's consent, sir?""I love books which teach a proper deference in young persons to their
parents.In a novel the young people may fall in love without their
countenance, because it is essential to the necessary intricacy of the
story; but they must always have the benefit of their consent at last.Even old Delville received Cecilia, though the daughter of a man of low
birth.""And even so, madam," replied I, "Lady Margaret was prevailed on to
countenance Morton, although the old Covenanter, his father, stuck sorely
with her for some time.Edith was her only hope, and she wished to see
her happy; Morton, or Melville Morton, as he was more generally called,
stood so high in the reputation of the world, and was in every other
respect such an eligible match, that she put her prejudice aside, and
consoled herself with the recollection that marriage went by destiny, as
was observed to her, she said, by his most sacred Majesty, Charles the
Second of happy memory, when she showed him the portrait of her
grand-father Fergus, third Earl of Torwood, the handsomest man of his
time, and that of Countess Jane, his second lady, who had a hump-back
and only one eye.This was his Majesty's observation, she said, on one
remarkable morning when he deigned to take his _disjune_--"

"Nay," said Miss Buskbody, again interrupting me, "if she brought such
authority to countenance her acquiescing in a misalliance, there was no
more to be said.--And what became of old Mrs.What's her name, the
housekeeper?""She was perhaps the happiest of the
party; for once a year, and not oftener, Mr.Melville Morton
dined in the great wainscotted chamber in solemn state, the hangings
being all displayed, the carpet laid down, and the huge brass candlestick
set on the table, stuck round with leaves of laurel.The preparing the
room for this yearly festival employed her mind for six months before it
came about, and the putting matters to rights occupied old Alison the
other six, so that a single day of rejoicing found her business for all
the year round.""Lived to a good old age, drank ale and brandy with guests of all
persuasions, played Whig or Jacobite tunes as best pleased his customers,
and died worth as much money as married Jenny to a cock laird.I hope,
ma'am, you have no other inquiries to make, for really--"

"Goose-Gibbie, sir?"said my persevering friend,--"Goose-Gibbie, whose
ministry was fraught with such consequences to the personages of the
narrative?""Consider, my dear Miss Buskbody, (I beg pardon for the
familiarity),--but pray consider, even the memory of the renowned
Scheherazade, that Empress of Tale-tellers, could not preserve every
circumstance.I am not quite positive as to the fate of Goose-Gibbie,
but am inclined to think him the same with one Gilbert Dudden, alias
Calf-Gibbie, who was whipped through Hamilton for stealing poultry."Miss Buskbody now placed her left foot on the fender, crossed her right
leg over her knee, lay back on the chair, and looked towards the ceiling.When I observed her assume this contemplative mood, I concluded she was
studying some farther cross-examination, and therefore took my hat and
wished her a hasty good-night, ere the Demon of Criticism had supplied
her with any more queries.In like manner, gentle Reader, returning you
my thanks for the patience which has conducted you thus far, I take the
liberty to withdraw myself from you for the present.It was mine earnest wish, most courteous Reader, that the "Tales of my
Landlord" should have reached thine hands in one entire succession of
tomes, or volumes.But as I sent some few more manuscript quires,
containing the continuation of these most pleasing narratives, I was
apprised, somewhat unceremoniously, by my publisher that he did not
approve of novels (as he injuriously called these real histories)
extending beyond four volumes, and if I did not agree to the first four
being published separately, he threatened to decline the article.as if the vernacular article of our mother English were
capable of declension.)Whereupon, somewhat moved by his remonstrances,
and more by heavy charges for print and paper, which he stated to have
been already incurred, I have resolved that these four volumes shall be
the heralds or avant-couriers of the Tales which are yet in my
possession, nothing doubting that they will be eagerly devoured, and the
remainder anxiously demanded, by the unanimous voice of a discerning
public.I rest, esteemed Reader, thine as thou shalt construe me,

terrified bleating mingled fearfully with our shouts of victory; and
when, at the command of our captain.I blew the signal to halt and
rendezvous, our brave fellows magnanimously gave up the pursuit, and
returned from the chase, bringing with them no less than five full-grown
prisoners, as trophies of victory!A council of war was immediately called, to determine in what way we
should dispose of our booty.After much learned discussion, and some
warm disputes, the propositions were narrowed down to two:

Plan the first was, to cut off all the beard of each prisoner, flog, and
release him.Plan the second, on the contrary, was, to conduct the prisoners to the
playground, treat them kindly, and endeavor to train them to the bit and
saddle, so as to furnish the officers with what they needed so
much,--war-steeds for battle, fiery chargers for review.The vote was finally taken, and plan number two was adopted by a
considerable majority.Obstacles are never insurmountable to boys and Bonapartes!Our _coup
d'etat_ succeeded quite as well as that of the 2d of December, and
before a week elapsed the chief officers were all splendidly mounted and
fully equipped.At this stage of the war against the "bearded races," the cavalry
question was propounded by one of the privates in Company A. For his
part, he declared candidly that he was tired of marching and
countermarching afoot, and that he saw no good reason why an invasion of
the enemy's country should not at once be undertaken, to secure animals
enough to mount the whole regiment.Another council was held, and the resolve unanimously adopted, to cross
the border in full force, on the next Saturday afternoon.In the meantime, the clouds of war began to thicken in another quarter.Colonel Averitt had been informed of the _coup d'etat_ related above,
and determined to prevent any further depredations on his flock by a
stroke of masterly generalship, worthy of his prowess in the late war
with Great Britain.And now it becomes proper to introduce upon the scene the most important
personage in this history, and the hero of the whole story.I allude, of
course, to the bold, calm, dignified, undaunted and imperturbable
natural guardian of the Colonel's fold--Billy Goat!He boasted of a beard longer, whiter, and more venerable than a
high-priest in Masonry; his mane emulated that of the king of beasts;
his horns were as crooked, and almost as long, as the Cashie River, on
whose banks he was born; his tail might have been selected by some
Spanish hidalgo, as a coat of arms, emblematic of the pride and hauteur
of his family; whilst his _tout ensemble_ presented that dignity of
demeanor, majesty of carriage, consciousness of superior fortune, and
defiance of all danger, which we may imagine characterized the elder
Napoleon previous to the battle of Waterloo.But our hero possessed
moral qualities quite equal to his personal traits.He was brave to a
fault, combative to a miracle, and as invincible in battle as he was
belligerent in mood.The sight of a coat-tail invariably excited his
anger, and a red handkerchief nearly distracted him with rage.Indeed,
he had recently grown so irascible that Colonel Averitt was compelled to
keep him shut up in the fowl-yard, a close prisoner, to protect him from
a justly indignant neighborhood.Such was the champion that the Colonel now released and placed at the
head of the opposing forces.Saturday came at last, and the entire
morning was devoted to the construction of the proper number of wooden
bits, twine bridle-reins, leather stirrups and pasteboard saddles.By
twelve o'clock everything was ready, and the order given to march.We
were disappointed in not finding the enemy at his accustomed haunt, and
had to prolong our march nearly half a mile before we came up with him.Our scouts, however, soon discovered him in an old field, lying encamped
beneath some young persimmon bushes, and entirely unconscious of
impending danger.We approached stealthily, according to our usual plan,
and then at a concerted signal rushed headlong upon the foe.But we had
no sooner given the alarm than our enemies sprang to their feet, and
clustered about a central object, which we immediately recognized, to
our chagrin and terror, as none other than Billy Goat himself.The captain, however, was not to be daunted or foiled; he boldly made a
plunge at the champion of our adversaries, and would have succeeded in
seizing him by the horns, if he had not been unfortunately butted over
before he could reach them.Two or three of our bravest comrades flew to
his assistance, but met with the same fate before they could rescue him
from danger.The remainder of us drew off a short but prudent distance
from the field of battle, to hold a council of war, and determine upon a
plan of operations.In a few moments our wounded companions joined us,
and entreated us to close at once upon the foe and surround him.They
declared they were not afraid to beard the lion in his den, and that
being butted heels over head two or three times but whetted their
courage, and incited them to deeds of loftier daring.Their eloquence,
however, was more admired than their prudence, and a large majority of
the council decided that "it was inopportune, without other munitions of
war than those we had upon the field, to risk a general engagement."It
was agreed, however, _nem.con._, that on the next Saturday we would
provide ourselves with ropes and fishing-poles, and such other arms as
might prove advantageous, and proceed to surround and noose our most
formidable enemy, overpower him by the force of numbers, and take him
prisoner at all hazards.Having fully determined upon this plan of
attack, we hoisted our flag once more, ordered the drum to beat Yankee
Doodle, and retreated in most excellent order from the field--our foe
not venturing to pursue us.The week wore slowly and uneasily away.The clouds of war were gathering
rapidly, and the low roll of distant thunder announced that a battle
storm of no ordinary importance was near at hand.Colonel Averitt, by
some traitorous trick of war, had heard of our former defeat, and
publicly taunted our commander with his failure.Indeed, more than one
of the villagers had heard of the disastrous result of the campaign, and
sent impertinent messages to those who had been wounded in the
encounter.Two or three of the young ladies, also, in the girls'
department, had been inoculated with the _fun_ (as it was absurdly
denominated), and a leather medal was pinned most provokingly to the
short jacket of the captain by one of those hoydenish Amazons.All these events served to whet the courage of our men, and strange as
it may appear, to embitter our hostility to our victorious foe.Some of
the officers proceeded so far as to threaten Colonel Averitt himself,
and at one time, I am confident, he stood in almost as much danger as
the protector of his flock.Saturday came at last, and at the first blast of the bugle, we formed
into line, and advanced with great alacrity into the enemy's country.After marching half an hour, our scouts hastily returned, with the
information that the enemy was drawn up, in full force, near the scene
of the Persimmon bush battle.We advanced courageously to within
speaking distance, and then halted to breathe the troops and prepare for
the engagement.We surveyed our enemies with attention, but without
alarm."Firm paced and slow, a horrid front they form;
     Still as the breeze, but dreadful as the storm!"Our preparations were soon made, and at the command of the captain, we
separated into single files, one half making a _detour_ to the right,
and the other to the left, so as to encircle the foe.Our instructions
were to spare all non-combatants, to pass by as unworthy of notice all
minor foes, and to make a simultaneous rush upon the proud champion of
our adversaries.By this masterly manoeuvre it was supposed we should be enabled to
escape unharmed, or at any rate without many serious casualties.But as
it afterward appeared, we did not sufficiently estimate the strength and
activity of our enemy.After this preparatory manoeuvre had been successfully accomplished,
our captain gave the order to "charge!"in a stentorian voice, and at
the same time rushed forward most gallantly at the head of the
squadron.The post of honor is generally the post of danger also, and so
it proved on this occasion; for before the captain could grapple with
the foe, Billy Goat rose suddenly on his hinder legs, and uttering a
loud note of defiance, dashed with lightning speed at the breast of our
commander, and at a single blow laid him prostrate on the field.Then
wheeling quickly, ere any of his assailants could attack his rear flank,
he performed the same exploit upon the first and second lieutenants, and
made an unsuccessful pass at the standard-bearer, who eluded the danger
by a scientific retreat.At this moment, when the fortunes of the day
hung, as it were, on a single hair, our drummer, who enjoyed the
_sobriquet_ of "Weasel," advanced slowly but chivalrously upon the foe.As the hosts of Israel and Gath paused upon the field of Elah, and
awaited with fear and trembling the issue of the single-handed contest
between David and Goliah; as Roman and Sabine stood back and reposed on
their arms, whilst Horatio and Curiatii fought for the destiny of Rome
and the mastery of the world, so the "Woodville Cadets" halted in their
tracks on this memorable day, and all aghast with awe and admiration,
watched the progress of the terrible duello between "Weasel," the
drummer boy, and Billy Goat, the hero of the battle of the Persimmon
bush.The drummer first disengaged himself from the incumbrance of his martial
music, then threw his hat fiercely upon the ground, and warily and
circumspectly approached his foe.Nor was that foe unprepared, for
rearing as usual on his nether extremities, he bleated out a long note
of contempt and defiance, and dashed suddenly upon the "Weasel."Instead of waiting to receive the force of the blow upon his breast or
brow, the drummer wheeled right-about face, and falling suddenly upon
all fours with most surprising dexterity, presented a less vulnerable
part of his body to his antagonist, who, being under full headway, was
compelled to accept the substituted buttress, and immediately planted
there a herculean thump.I need not say that the drummer was hurled many
feet heels over head, by this disastrous blow; but he had obtained the
very advantage he desired to secure, and springing upon his feet he
leaped quicker than lightning upon the back of his foe, and in spite of
every effort to dislodge him, sat there in security and triumph!With a loud huzza, the main body of the "Cadets" now rushed forward, and
after a feeble resistance, succeeded in overpowering the champion of our
foes.As a matter of precaution, we blindfolded him with several
handkerchiefs, and led him away in as much state as the Emperor Aurelian
displayed when he carried Zenobia to Rome, a prisoner at his
chariot-wheels.The fate of the vanquished Billy Goat is soon related.A council of war
decided that he should be taken into a dense pine thicket, there
suspended head downwards, and thrashed _ad libitum_, by the whole army.The sentence was carried into execution immediately; and though he was
cut down and released after our vengeance was satisfied, I yet owe it to
truth and history to declare, that before a week elapsed, he died of a
broken heart, and was buried by Colonel Averitt with all the honors of
war.If it be any satisfaction to the curious inquirer, I may add in
conclusion, that the Rev.Craig avenged his _manes_, by wearing out
a chinquapin apiece on the backs of "Weasel," the captain and officers,
and immediately afterward disbanded the whole army._FOR AN ALBUM._


    When first our father, Adam, sinned
      Against the will of Heaven,
    And forth from Eden's happy gates
      A wanderer was driven,
    He paused beside a limpid brook,
      That through the garden ran,
    And, gazing in its mirrored wave,
      Beheld himself--_a man_!God's holy peace no longer beamed
      In brightness from his eye;
    But in its depths dark passions blazed,
      Like lightnings in the sky.Young Innocence no longer wreathed
      His features with her smile;
    But Sin sat there in scorched dismay,
      Like some volcanic isle.No longer radiant beauty shone
      Upon his manly brow;
    But care had traced deep furrows there,
      With stern misfortune's plow.Joy beamed no longer from his face;
      His step was sad and slow;
    His heart was heavy with its grief;
      His bosom with its woe.Whilst gazing at his altered form
      Within the mirrored brook,
    He spied an angel leaning o'er,
      With pity in her look.He turned, distrustful of his sight,
      Unwilling to believe,
    When, lo!in Heaven's own radiance smiled,
      His sweet companion, Eve!Fondly he clasped her to his heart,
      And blissfully he cried,
    "What tho' I've lost a Paradise,
      I've gained an angel bride!No flowers in Eden ever bloomed,
      No!not in heaven above,
    Sweeter than woman brings to man--
      Her friendship, truth, and love!"These buds were brought by Adam's bride,
      Outside of Eden's gate,
    And scattered o'er the world; _to them_
      This book I dedicate.[Decoration]

V._PHASES IN THE LIFE OF JOHN POLLEXFEN._


PHASE THE FIRST.There are but three persons now living who can truthfully answer the
question, "How did John Pollexfen, the photographer, make his fortune?"No confidence will be violated, now that he is dead, and his heirs
residents of a foreign country, if I relate the story of that singular
man, whose rapid accumulation of wealth astonished the whole circle of
his acquaintance.Returning from the old man's funeral a few days since, the subject of
Pollexfen's discoveries became the topic of conversation; and my
companions in the same carriage, aware that, as his attorney and
confidential friend, I knew more of the details of his business than any
one else, extorted from me a promise that at the first leisure moment I
would relate, in print, the secret of that curious invention by which
the photographic art was so largely enriched, and himself elevated at
once to the acme of opulence and renown.Few persons who were residents of the city of San Francisco at an early
day, will fail to remember the site of the humble gallery in which
Pollexfen laid the foundations of his fame.It was situated on Merchant
Street, about midway between Kearny and Montgomery Streets, in an old
wooden building; the ground being occupied at present by the solid brick
structure of Thomas R. Bolton.It fed the flames of the great May fire
of 1851, was rebuilt, but again consumed in December, 1853.It was
during the fall of the latter year that the principal event took place
which is to constitute the most prominent feature of my narrative.I am aware that the facts will be discredited by many, and doubted at
first by all; but I beg to premise, at the outset, that because they are
uncommon, by no means proves that they are untrue.Besides, should the
question ever become a judicial one, I hold in my hands such _written
proofs_, signed by the parties most deeply implicated, as will at once
terminate both doubt and litigation.Of this, however, I have at present
no apprehensions; for Lucile and her husband are both too honorable to
assail the reputation of the dead, and too rich themselves to attempt to
pillage the living.As it is my wish to be distinctly understood, and at the same time to be
exculpated from all blame for the part I myself acted in the drama, the
story must commence with my first acquaintance with Mademoiselle Lucile
Marmont.In the spring of 1851, I embarked at New York for Panama, or rather
Chagres, on board the steamship "Ohio," Captain Schenck, on my way to
the then distant coast of California, attracted hither by the universal
desire to accumulate a rapid fortune, and return at the earliest
practicable period to my home, on the Atlantic seaboard.There were many hundred such passengers on the same ship.But little
sociability prevailed, until after the steamer left Havana, where it was
then the custom to touch on the "outward bound," to obtain a fresh
supply of fuel and provisions.We were detained longer than customary at
Havana, and most of the passengers embraced the opportunity to visit
the Bishop's Garden and the tomb of Columbus.One morning, somewhat earlier than usual, I was standing outside the
railing which incloses the monument of the great discoverer, and had
just transcribed in my note-book the following epitaph:

    "O!Restos y Imagen
       Del Grande Colon:
     Mil siglos durad guardados
       En lare Urna,
     Y en la Remembranza
       De Nuestra Nacion,"

when I was suddenly interrupted by a loud scream directly behind me.On
turning, I beheld a young lady whom I had seen but once before on the
steamer, leaning over the prostrate form of an elderly female, and
applying such restoratives as were at hand to resuscitate her, for she
had fainted.Seeing me, the daughter exclaimed, "_Oh, Monsieur!y-a-t-il
un medecin ici?_" I hastened to the side of the mother, and was about to
lift her from the pavement, when M. Marmont himself entered the
cathedral.I assisted him in placing his wife in a _volante_ then
passing, and she was safely conveyed to the hotel.Having myself some knowledge of both French and Spanish, and able to
converse in either tongue, Lucile Marmont, then sixteen years of age,
and I, from that time forward, became close and confidential friends.The steamer sailed the next day, and in due time anchored off the
roadstead of Chagres.Marmont, in the last stages of
consumption when she embarked at New York, continued extremely ill until
we passed Point Concepcion, on this coast, when she suddenly expired
from an attack of hemorrhage of the lungs.She was buried at sea; and never can I forget the unutterable anguish of
poor Lucile, as her mother's body splashed into the cold blue waters of
the Pacific.There she stood, holding on to the railing, paler than monumental
marble, motionless as a statue, rigid as a corpse.The whole scene
around her seemed unperceived.Her eyes gazed upon vacancy; her head was
thrust slightly forward, and her disheveled tresses, black as Plutonian
night, fell neglected about her shoulders.Captain Watkins, then commanding the "Panama"--whom, may God bless--wept
like a child; and his manly voice, that never quailed in the dread
presence of the lightning or the hurricane, broke, chokingly, as he
attempted to finish the burial rite, and died away in agitated sobs.One by one the passengers left the spot, consecrated to the grief of
that only child--now more than orphaned by her irreparable loss.Lifting
my eyes, at last, none save the daughter and her father stood before me.Charmed to the spot was I, by a spell that seemed irresistible.Scarcely
able to move a muscle, there I remained, speechless and overpowered.Finally the father spoke, and then Lucile fell headlong into his arms.He bore her into his state-room, where the ship's surgeon was summoned,
and where he continued his ministrations until we reached this port.It is scarcely necessary to add, that I attended them ashore, and saw
them safely and commodiously lodged at the old Parker House, before I
once thought of my own accommodations.Weeks passed, and months, too, stole gradually away, before I saw
anything more of the bereaved and mourning child.One day, however, as I
was lolling carelessly in my office, after business hours (and that
meant just at dark in those early times), Lucile hastily entered.I was
startled to see her; for upon her visage I thought I beheld the same
stolid spell of agony that some months before had transfixed my very
soul.Before I had time to recover myself, or ask her to be seated, she
approached closer, and said in a half whisper, "Oh, sir, come with me
home."On our way she explained that her father was lying dangerously ill, and
that she knew no physician to whom she could apply, and in whose skill
she could place confidence.H. M. White (since
dead), well knowing not only his great success, but equally cognizant of
that universal charity that rendered him afterwards no less beloved than
illustrious.Without a moment's hesitation, the Doctor seized his hat,
and hastened along with us, to the wretched abode of the sick, and, as
it afterwards proved, the palsied father.The disease was pronounced
apoplexy, and recovery doubtful.Whilst we were
seated around the bedside, a tall, emaciated, feeble, but very handsome
young man entered, and staggered to a seat.He was coarsely and meanly
clad; but there was something about him that not only betokened the
gentleman, but the well-bred and accomplished scholar.As he seated
himself, he exchanged a glance with Lucile, and in that silent look I
read the future history of both their lives.On lifting my eyes toward
hers, the pallor fled for an instant from her cheek, and a traitor blush
flashed its crimson confession across her features.The patient was copiously bled from an artery in the temple, and
gradually recovered his consciousness, but on attempting to speak we
ascertained that partial paralysis had resulted from the fit.As I rose, with the Doctor, to leave, Lucile beckoned me to remain, and
approaching me more closely, whispered in French, "Stay, and I will tell
you all."The main points of her story, though deeply interesting to me,
at that time, were so greatly eclipsed by subsequent events, that they
are scarcely worthy of narration.Indeed, I shall not attempt to detail
them here fully, but will content myself with stating, in few words,
only such events as bear directly upon the fortunes of John Pollexfen.As intimated above, Lucile was an only child.She was born in Dauphiny,
a province of France, and immigrated to America during the disastrous
year 1848.Her father was exiled, and his estates seized by the officers
of the government, on account of his political tenets.The family
embarked at Marseilles, with just sufficient ready money to pay their
passage to New York, and support them for a few months after their
arrival.It soon became apparent that want, and perhaps starvation, were
in store, unless some means of obtaining a livelihood could be devised.The sole expedient was music, of which M. Marmont was a proficient, and
to this resource he at once applied himself most industriously.He had
accumulated a sufficient sum to pay his expenses to this coast, up to
the beginning of 1851, and took passage for San Francisco, as we have
already seen, in the spring of that year.Reaching here, he became more embarrassed every day, unacquainted as he
was with the language, and still less with the wild life into which he
was so suddenly plunged.Whilst poverty was pinching his body, grief for
the loss of his wife was torturing his soul.Silent, sad, almost morose
to others, his only delight was in his child.Apprehensions for her
fate, in case of accident to himself, embittered his existence, and
hastened the catastrophe above related.Desirous of placing her in a
situation in which she could earn a livelihood, independent of his own
precarious exertions, he taught her drawing and painting, and had just
succeeded in obtaining for her the employment of coloring photographs at
Pollexfen's gallery the very day he was seized with his fatal disorder.Some weeks previous to this, Charles Courtland, the young man before
mentioned, became an inmate of his house under the following
circumstances:

One evening, after the performances at the Jenny Lind Theatre (where M.
Marmont was employed) were over, and consequently very late, whilst he
was pursuing his lonely way homewards he accidentally stumbled over an
impediment in his path.He at once recognized it as a human body, and
being near home, he lifted the senseless form into his house.A severe
contusion behind the ear had been the cause of the young man's
misfortune, and his robbery had been successfully accomplished whilst
lying in a state of insensibility.His recovery was extremely slow, and though watched by the brightest
pair of eyes that ever shot their dangerous glances into a human soul,
Courtland had not fully recovered his strength up to the time that I
made his acquaintance.He was a Virginian by birth; had spent two years in the mines on Feather
River, and having accumulated a considerable sum of money, came to San
Francisco to purchase a small stock of goods, with which he intended to
open a store at Bidwell's Bar.His robbery frustrated all these golden
dreams, and his capture by Lucile Marmont completed his financial ruin.Here terminates the first phase in the history of John Pollexfen.exclaimed John Pollexfen, as he dashed
a glass negative, which he had most elaborately prepared, into the
slop-bucket.After a moment's
silence, he again spoke: "But I know _it exists_.Nature has the secret
locked up securely, as she thinks, but I'll tear it from her.Is not the retina impressible to the faintest gleam of
light?What telegraphs to my soul the colors of the rainbow?Nothing but
the eye, the human eye.And shall John Pollexfen be told, after he has
lived half a century, that the compacted humors of this little organ can
do more than his whole laboratory?I'll wrest the secret from
the labyrinth of nature, or pluck my own eyes from their sockets."Thus soliloquized John Pollexfen, a few days after the events narrated
in the last chapter.He was seated at a table, in a darkened chamber, with a light burning,
though in the middle of the day, and his countenance bore an
unmistakable expression of disappointment, mingled with disgust, at the
failure of his last experiment.He was evidently in an ill-humor, and
seemed puzzled what to do next.Just then a light tap came at the door,
and in reply to an invitation to enter, the pale, delicate features of
Lucile Marmont appeared at the threshold.After surveying the painted photographs a moment, he
broke out into a sort of artistic glee: "Beautiful!Come, have no secrets from me; I'm an
old man, and may be of service to you yet.Before relating any more of the conversation, it becomes necessary to
paint John Pollexfen as he was.Methinks I can see his tall, rawboned,
angular form before me, even now, as I write these lines.There he
stands, Scotch all over, from head to foot.It was whispered about in
early times--for really no one knew much about his previous career--that
John Pollexfen had been a famous sea captain; that he had sailed around
the world many times; had visited the coast of Africa under suspicious
circumstances, and finally found his way to California from the then
unpopular region of Australia.Without pausing to trace these rumors
further, it must be admitted that there was something in the appearance
of the man sufficiently repulsive, at first sight, to give them
currency.He had a large bushy head, profusely furnished with hair
almost brickdust in color, and growing down upon a broad, low forehead,
indicative of great mathematical and constructive power.His brows were
long and shaggy, and overhung a restless, deep-set, cold, gray eye, that
met the fiercest glance unquailingly, and seemed possessed of that
magnetic power which dazzles, reads and confounds whatsoever it looks
upon.There was no escape from its inquisitive glitter.It sounded the
very depths of the soul it thought proper to search.Whilst gazing at
you, instinct felt the glance before your own eye was lifted so as to
encounter his.It was as
pitiless as the gleam of the lightning.But you felt no less that high
intelligence flashed from its depths.Courage, you knew, was there; and
true bravery is akin to all the nobler virtues.This man, you at once
said, may be cold, but it is impossible for him to be unjust, deceitful
or ungenerous.He might, like Shylock, insist on a _right_, no matter
how vindictive, but he would never forge a claim, no matter how
insignificant.He might crush, like Caesar, but he could never plot like
Catiline.In addition to all this, it required but slight knowledge of
physiognomy to perceive that his stern nature was tinctured with genuine
enthusiasm.Earnestness beamed forth in every feature.His soul was as
sincere as it was unbending.He could not trifle, even with the most
inconsiderable subject.He could smile, but there
was little contagion in his pleasantry.It surprised more than it
pleased you.Blended with this deep, scrutinizing, earnest and
enthusiastic nature, there was an indefinable something, shading the
whole character--it might have been early sorrow, or loss of fortune, or
baffled ambition, or unrequited love.Still, it shone forth patent to
the experienced eye, enigmatical, mysterious, sombre.There was danger,
also, in it, and many, who knew him best, attributed his eccentricity to
a softened phase of insanity.But the most marked practical trait of Pollexfen's character was his
enthusiasm for his art.He studied its history, from the humble hints of
Niepce to the glorious triumphs of Farquer, Bingham, and Bradley, with
all the soul-engrossing fidelity of a child, and spent many a midnight
hour in striving to rival or surpass them.It was always a subject of
astonishment with me, until after his death, how it happened that a
rough, athletic seaman, as people declared he was originally, should
become so intensely absorbed in a science requiring delicacy of taste,
and skill in manipulation rather than power of muscle, in its practical
application.But after carefully examining the papers tied up in the
same package with his last will and testament, I ceased to wonder, and
sought no further for an explanation.Most prominent amongst these carefully preserved documents was an old
diploma, granted by the University of Edinburgh, in the year 1821, to
"John Pollexfen, Gent., of Hallicardin, Perthshire," constituting him
Doctor of Medicine.On the back of the diploma, written in a round,
clear hand, I found indorsed as follows:

   Fifteen years of my life have I lost by professing modern
   quackery.Medicine is not a science, properly so called.It is at
   most but an art.Each generation adopts its peculiar manual: Sangrado to-day;
   Thomson to-morrow; Hahnemann the day after.Surgery advances;
   physic is stationary.But chemistry, glorious chemistry, is a
   science.Born amid dissolving ruins, and cradled upon rollers of
   fire, her step is onward.At her side, as an humble menial,
   henceforth shall be found

                                                JOHN POLLEXFEN.The indorsement bore no date, but it must have been written long before
his immigration to California.Let us now proceed with the interview between the photographer and his
employee.Repeating the question quickly, "Who gave you the cue?""My father taught me drawing and painting, but my own taste suggested
the coloring.""Do you mean to tell me, really, that you taught yourself, Mlle.and as he said this, the cold, gray eye lit up with unwonted
brilliancy."What I say is true," replied the girl, and elevating her own lustrous
eyes, they encountered his own, with a glance quite as steady."Let us go into the sunlight, and examine the tints more fully;" and
leading the way they emerged into the sitting-room where customers were
in the habit of awaiting the artist's pleasure.Here the pictures were again closely scrutinized, but far more
accurately than before; and after fully satisfying his curiosity on the
score of the originality of the penciling, approached Lucile very
closely, and darting his wonderful glance into the depths of her own
eyes, said, after a moment's pause, "You have glorious eyes."Lucile was about to protest, in a hurried way, against such adulation,
when he continued: "Nay, nay, do not deny it.Your eyes are the most
fathomless orbs that ever I beheld--large, too, and lustrous--the very
eyes I have been searching for these five years past.A judge of color;
a rare judge of color!How is your father to-day, my child?"The tone of voice in which this last remark was made had in it more of
the curious than the tender.It seemed to have been propounded more as a
matter of business than of feeling.Still, Lucile replied respectfully,
"Oh!worse, sir; a great deal worse.Doctor White declares that it is
impossible for him to recover, and that he cannot live much longer."replied Pollexfen, "not live?"Then, as if musing, he
solemnly added, "When your father is dead, Lucile, come to me, and I
will make your fortune.That is, if you follow my advice, and place
yourself exclusively under my instructions.Nay, but you shall earn it
yourself.he exclaimed, and producing a bank deposit-book from his
pocket, "See!here have I seven thousand five hundred dollars in bank,
and I would gladly exchange it for one of your eyes."Astonishment overwhelmed the girl, and she could make no immediate
reply; and before she had sufficiently recovered her self-possession to
speak, the photographer hastily added, "Don't wonder; farewell, now.Remember what I have said--seven thousand five hundred dollars just for
one eye!"Lucile was glad to escape, without uttering a syllable.Pursuing her way
homewards, she pondered deeply over the singular remark with which
Pollexfen closed the conversation, and half muttering, said to herself,
"Can he be in earnest?or is it simply the odd way in which an eccentric
man pays a compliment?"But long before she could solve the enigma,
other thoughts, far more engrossing, took sole possession of her mind.She fully realized her situation--a dying father, and a sick lover, both
dependent in a great measure upon her exertions, and she herself not yet
past her seventeenth year.On reaching home she found the door wide open, and Courtland standing in
the entrance, evidently awaiting her arrival.As she approached, their
eyes met, and a glance told her that all was over.A stifled sob was all that broke from the lips of the child, as she fell
lifeless into the arms of her lover.I pass over the mournful circumstances attending the funeral of the
exiled Frenchman.He was borne to his grave by a select few of his
countrymen, whose acquaintance he had made during his short residence in
this city.Like thousands of others, who have perished in our midst, he
died, and "left no sign."The newspapers published the item the next
morning, and before the sun had set upon his funeral rites the poor man
was forgotten by all except the immediate persons connected with this
narrative.To one of them, at least, his death was not only an important event, but
it formed a great epoch in her history.Lucile was transformed, in a moment of time, from a helpless, confiding,
affectionate girl, into a full-grown, self-dependent, imperious woman.Such revolutions, I know, are rare in everyday life, and but seldom
occur; in fact, they never happen except in those rare instances where
nature has stamped a character with the elements of inborn originality
and force, which accident, or sudden revulsion, develops at once into
full maturity.To such a soul, death of an only parent operates like the
summer solstice upon the whiter snow of Siberia.It melts away the
weakness and credulity of childhood almost miraculously, and exhibits,
with the suddenness of an apparition, the secret and hitherto unknown
traits that will forever afterwards distinguish the individual.The
explanation of this curious moral phenomenon consists simply in bringing
to the surface what already was in existence below; not in the
instantaneous creation of new elements of character.The tissues were
already there; circumstance hardens them into bone.Thus we sometimes
behold the same marvel produced by the marriage of some characterless
girl, whom we perhaps had known from infancy, and whose individuality we
had associated with cake, or crinoline--a gay humming-bird of social
life, so light and frivolous and unstable, that, as she flitted across
our pathway, we scarcely deigned her the compliment of a thought.Yet a
week or a month after her nuptials, we meet the self-same warbler, not
as of old, beneath the paternal roof, but under her own "vine and
fig-tree," and in astonishment we ask ourselves, "Can this be the
bread-and-butter Miss we passed by with the insolence of a sneer, a
short time ago?"Upon her
features beam out palpably traits of great force and originality.She
moves with the majesty of a queen, and astounds us by taking a leading
part in the discussion of questions of which we did not deem she ever
dreamed.Are all her laws suspended, that she might
transform, in an instant, a puling trifler into a perfect woman?Not nature is false, but you are yourself ignorant of her
laws.Study Shakspeare; see Gloster woo, and win, the defiant,
revengeful and embittered Lady Anne, and confess in your humility that
it is far more probable that you should err, than that Shakspeare should
be mistaken.Not many days after the death of M. Marmont, it was agreed by all the
friends of Lucile, that the kind offer extended to her by Pollexfen
should be accepted, and that she should become domiciliated in his
household.He was unmarried, it is true, but still he kept up an
establishment.His housekeeper was a dear old lady, Scotch, like her
master, but a direct contrast in every trait of her character.Her
duties were not many, nor burdensome.Her time was chiefly occupied in
family matters--cooking, washing, and feeding the pets--so that it was
but seldom she made her appearance in any other apartment than those
entirely beneath her own supervision.The photographer had an assistant in his business, a Chinaman; and upon
him devolved the task of caring for the outer offices.Courtland, with a small stock of money, and still smaller modicum of
health, left at once for Bidwell's Bar, where he thought of trying his
fortune once more at mining, and where he was well and most cordially
known.It now only remained to accompany Lucile to her new home, to see her
safely ensconced in her new quarters, to speak a flattering word in her
favor to Pollexfen, and then, to bid her farewell, perhaps forever.All
this was duly accomplished, and with good-bye on my lips, and a
sorrowful sympathy in my heart, I turned away from the closing door of
the photographer, and wended my way homewards.Mademoiselle Marmont was met at the threshold by Martha McClintock, the
housekeeper, and ushered at once into the inner apartment, situated in
the rear of the gallery.After removing her veil and cloak, she threw herself into an arm-chair,
and shading her eyes with both her hands, fell into a deep reverie.She
had been in that attitude but a few moments, when a large Maltese cat
leaped boldly into her lap, and began to court familiarity by purring
and playing, as with an old acquaintance.Lucile cast a casual glance at
the animal, and noticed immediately that it had but _one eye_!Expressing no astonishment, but feeling a great deal, she cast her eyes
cautiously around the apartment.Near the window hung a large tin cage, containing a blue African parrot,
with crimson-tipped shoulders and tail.At the foot of the sofa, a
silken-haired spaniel was quietly sleeping, whilst, outside the window,
a bright little canary was making the air melodious with its happy
warbling.A noise in an adjoining room aroused the dog, and set it
barking.As it lifted its glossy ears and turned its graceful head
toward Lucile, her surprise was enhanced in the greatest degree, by
perceiving that it, too, had lost an eye.Rising, she approached the
window, impelled by a curiosity that seemed irresistible.Peering into
the cage, she coaxed the lazy parrot to look at her, and her amazement
was boundless when she observed that the poor bird was marred in the
same mournful manner.Martha witnessed her astonishment, and indulged
in a low laugh, but said nothing.At this moment Pollexfen himself
entered the apartment, and with his appearance must terminate the second
phase of his history."Come and sit by me, Mademoiselle Marmont," said Pollexfen, advancing at
the same time to the sofa, and politely making way for the young lady,
who followed almost mechanically."You must not believe me as bad as I
may seem at first sight, for we all have redeeming qualities, if the
world would do us the justice to seek for them as industriously as for
our faults.""I am very well able to believe that," replied Lucile, "for my dear
father instructed me to act upon the maxim, that good predominates over
evil, even in this life; and I feel sure that I need fear no harm
beneath the roof of the only real benefactor----"

"Pshaw!we will not bandy compliments at our first sitting; they are the
prelude amongst men, to hypocrisy first, and wrong afterwards.May I so
far transgress the rules of common politeness as to ask your age?Not
from idle curiosity, I can assure you.""At my next birthday," said Lucile, "I shall attain the age of seventeen
years.""I had hoped you were
older, by a year.""My birthday is the 18th of November, and really, sir, I am curious to
know why you feel any disappointment that I am not older."nothing of any great consequence; only this, that by the laws of
California, on reaching the age of eighteen you become the sole mistress
of yourself.""I greatly fear," timidly added the girl, "that I shall have to
anticipate the law, and assume that responsibility at once.""But you can only contract through a guardian before that era in your
life; and in the agreement _between us, that is to be_, no third person
shall intermeddle.You must consider
yourself my equal here; there must be no secrets to hide from each
other; no suspicions engendered.Confidence is the
only path to mutual improvement.My business is large, but my ambition
to excel greater, far.and suddenly rising, so as
to confront Lucile, he darted one of those magnetic glances into the
very fortress of her soul, which we have before attempted to describe,
and added, in an altered tone of voice, "The sun's raybrush paints the
rainbow upon the evanescent cloud, and photographs an iris in the skies.The human eye catches the picture ere it fades, and transfers it with
all its beauteous tints to that prepared albumen, the retina.The soul
sees it there, and rejoices at the splendid spectacle.Shall insensate
nature outpaint the godlike mind?Can she leave her brightest colors on
the dark _collodion_ of a thunder-cloud, and I not transfer the blush of
a rose, or the vermilion of a dahlia, to my _Rivi_ or _Saxe_?Let us work together, girl; we'll lead the age we
live in.My name shall rival Titian's, and you shall yet see me snatch
the colors of the dying dolphin from decay, and bid them live forever."And so saying, he turned with a suddenness that startled his pupil, and
strode hastily out of the apartment.Unaccustomed, as Lucile had been from her very birth, to brusque
manners, like those of the photographer, their grotesqueness impressed
her with an indefinable relish for such awkward sincerity, and whetted
her appetite to see more of the man whose enthusiasm always got the
better of his politeness."He is no Frenchman," thought the girl, "but I like him none the less.He has been very, very kind to me, and I am at this moment dependent
upon him for my daily bread."Then, changing the direction of her
thoughts, they recurred to the subject-matter of Pollexfen's discourse."Here," thought she, "lies the clue to the labyrinth.If insane, his
madness is a noble one; for he would link his name with the progress of
his art.He seeks to do away with the necessity of such poor creatures
as myself, as adjuncts to photography.Nature, he thinks, should lay on
the coloring, not man--the Sun himself should paint, not the human
hand."And with these, and kindred thoughts, she opened her escritoire,
and taking out her pencils sat down to the performance of her daily
labor.Oh, blessed curse of Adam's posterity, healthful toil, all hail!Offspring of sin and shame--still heaven's best gift to man.Oh,
wondrous miracle of Providence!by which the chastisement of the progenitor transforms itself into a
priceless blessing upon the offspring!None but God himself could
transmute the sweat of the face into a panacea for the soul.How many
myriads have been cured by toil of the heart's sickness and the body's
infirmities!The clink of the hammer drowns, in its music, the
lamentations of pain and the sighs of sorrow.Even the distinctions of
rank and wealth and talents are all forgotten, and the inequalities of
stepdame Fortune all forgiven, whilst the busy whirls of industry are
bearing us onward to our goal.No condition in life is so much to be
envied as his who is too busy to indulge in reverie.Health is his
companion, happiness his friend.Ills flee from his presence as
night-birds from the streaking of the dawn.Pale Melancholy, and her
sister Insanity, never invade his dominions; for Mirth stands sentinel
at the border, and Innocence commands the garrison of his soul.Henceforth let no man war against fate whose lot has been cast in that
happy medium, equidistant from the lethargic indolence of superabundant
wealth, and the abject paralysis of straitened poverty.Let them toil
on, and remember that God is a worker, and strews infinity with
revolving worlds!Should he forget, in a moment of grief or triumph, of
gladness or desolation, that being born to toil, in labor only shall he
find contentment, let him ask of the rivers why they never rest, of the
sunbeams why they never pause.Yea, of the great globe itself, why it
travels on forever in the golden pathway of the ecliptic, and nature,
from her thousand voices, will respond: Motion is life, inertia is
death; action is health, stagnation is sickness; toil is glory, torpor
is disgrace!I cannot say that thoughts as profound as these found their way into the
mind of Lucile, as she plied her task, but nature vindicated her own
laws in her case, as she will always do, if left entirely to herself.As day after day and week after week rolled by, a softened sorrow, akin
only to grief--

    "As the mist resembles the rain"--

took the place of the poignant woe which had overwhelmed her at first,
and time laid a gentle hand upon her afflictions.Gradually, too, she
became attached to her art, and made such rapid strides towards
proficiency that Pollexfen ceased, finally, to give any instruction, or
offer any hints as to the manner in which she ought to paint.Thus her
own taste became her only guide; and before six months had elapsed after
the death of her father, the pictures of Pollexfen became celebrated
throughout the city and state, for the correctness of their coloring and
the extraordinary delicacy of their finish.His gallery was daily
thronged with the wealth, beauty and fashion of the great metropolis,
and the hue of his business assumed the coloring of success.But his soul was the slave of a single thought.Turmoil brooded there,
like darkness over chaos ere the light pierced the deep profound.During the six months which we have just said had elapsed since the
domiciliation of Mlle.Marmont beneath his roof, he had had many long
and perfectly frank conversations with her, upon the subject which most
deeply interested him.She had completely fathomed his secret, and by
degrees had learned to sympathize with him, in his search into the
hidden mysteries of photographic science.She even became the frequent
companion of his chemical experiments, and night after night attended
him in his laboratory, when the lazy world around them was buried in the
profoundest repose.Still, there was one subject which, hitherto, he had not broached, and
that was the one in which she felt all a woman's curiosity--_the offer
to purchase an eye_.She had long since ascertained the story of the
one-eyed pets in the parlor, and had not only ceased to wonder, but was
mentally conscious of having forgiven Pollexfen, in her own enthusiasm
for art.Finally, a whole year elapsed since the death of her father, and no
extraordinary change took place in the relations of the master and his
pupil.True, each day their intercourse became more unrestrained, and
their art-association more intimate.But this intimacy was not the tie
of personal friendship or individual esteem.It began in the laboratory,
and there it ended.Pollexfen had no soul except for his art; no love
outside of his profession.Money he seemed to care for but little,
except as a means of supplying his acids, salts and plates.He
rigorously tested every metal, in its iodides and bromides;
industriously coated his plates with every substance that could be
albumenized, and plunged his negatives into baths of every mineral that
could be reduced to the form of a vapor.His activity was prodigious;
his ingenuity exhaustless, his industry absolutely boundless.He was as
familiar with chemistry as he was with the outlines of the geography of
Scotland.Every headland, spring and promontory of that science he knew
by heart.The most delicate experiments he performed with ease, and the
greatest rapidity.Nature seemed to have endowed him with a native
aptitude for analysis.His love was as profound as it was ready; in
fact, if there was anything he detested more than loud laughter, it was
superficiality.He instinctively pierced at once to the roots and
sources of things; and never rested, after seeing an effect, until he
groped his way back to the cause."Never stand still," he would often
say to his pupil, "where the ground is boggy.This maxim was the great index to his character; the key to all
his researches.Time fled so rapidly and to Lucile so pleasantly, too, that she had
reached the very verge of her legal maturity before she once deigned to
bestow a thought upon what change, if any, her eighteenth birthday would
bring about.A few days preceding her accession to majority, a large
package of letters from France, _via_ New York, arrived, directed to M.
Marmont himself, and evidently written without a knowledge of his death.The bundle came to my care, and I hastened at once to deliver it,
personally, to the blooming and really beautiful Lucile.I had not seen
her for many months, and was surprised to find so great an improvement
in her health and appearance.Her manners were more marked, her
conversation more rapid and decided, and the general contour of her form
far more womanly.It required only a moment's interview to convince me
that she possessed unquestioned talent of a high order, and a spirit as
imperious as a queen's.Those famous eyes of hers, that had, nearly two
years before, attracted in such a remarkable manner the attention of
Pollexfen, had not failed in the least; on the contrary, time had
intensified their power, and given them a depth of meaning and a
dazzling brilliancy that rendered them almost insufferably bright.It
seemed to me that contact with the magnetic gaze of the photographer had
lent them something of his own expression, and I confess that when my
eye met hers fully and steadily, mine was always the first to droop.Knowing that she was in full correspondence with her lover, I asked
after Courtland, and she finally told me all she knew.He was still
suffering from the effect of the assassin's blow, and very recently had
been attacked by inflammatory rheumatism.His health seemed permanently
impaired, and Lucile wept bitterly as she spoke of the poverty in which
they were both plunged, and which prevented him from essaying the only
remedy that promised a radical cure.exclaimed she, "were it only in our power to visit _La belle
France_, to bask in the sunshine of Dauphiny, to sport amid the lakes of
the Alps, to repose beneath the elms of Chalons!""Perhaps," said I, "the very letters now unopened in your hands may
invite you back to the scenes of your childhood."no," she rejoined, "I recognize the handwriting of my widowed
aunt, and I tremble to break the seal."Rising shortly afterwards, I bade her a sorrowful farewell.Lucile sought her private apartment before she ventured to unseal the
dispatches.Many of the letters were old, and had been floating between
New York and Havre for more than a twelvemonth.One was of recent date,
and that was the first one perused by the niece.Below is a free
translation of its contents.It bore date at "Bordeaux, July 12, 1853,"
and ran thus:

   EVER DEAR AND BELOVED BROTHER:

   Why have we never heard from you since the beginning of 1851?I fear some terrible misfortune has overtaken you, and
   overwhelmed your whole family.Many times have I written during
   that long period, and prayed, oh!so promptly, that God would
   take you, and yours, in His holy keeping.And then our dear
   Lucile!what a life must be in store for her, in that wild
   and distant land!Beg of her to return to France; and do not
   fail, also, to come yourself.We have a new Emperor, as you must
   long since have learned, in the person of Louis Bonaparte, nephew
   of the great Napoleon.Your reactionist principles against
   Cavaignac and his colleagues, can be of no disservice to you at
   present.Come, and apply for restitution of the old estates; come, and be
   a protector of my seven orphans, now, alas!suffering even for
   the common necessaries of life.Need a fond sister say more to
   her only living brother?Thine, as in childhood,

                                                       ANNETTE."Misfortunes pour like a pitiless winter storm upon my devoted head,"
thought Lucile, as she replaced the letter in its envelope."Parents
dead; aunt broken-hearted; cousins starving, and I not able to afford
relief.I cannot even moisten their sorrows with a tear.I would weep,
but rebellion against fate rises in my soul, and dries up the fountain
of tears.Had Heaven made me a man it would not have been thus.I have
something here," she exclaimed, rising from her seat and placing her
hand upon her forehead, "that tells me I could do and dare, and endure."Her further soliloquy was here interrupted by a distinct rap at her
door, and on pronouncing the word "enter," Pollexfen, for the first time
since she became a member of his family, strode heavily into her
chamber.Lucile did not scream, or protest, or manifest either surprise
or displeasure at this unwonted and uninvited visit.She politely
pointed to a seat, and the photographer, without apology or hesitation,
seized the chair, and moving it so closely to her own that they came in
contact, seated himself without uttering a syllable.Then, drawing a
document from his breast pocket, which was folded formally, and sealed
with two seals, but subscribed only with one name, he proceeded to read
it from beginning to end, in a slow, distinct, and unfaltering tone.I have the document before me, as I write, and I here insert a full and
correct copy.It bore date just one month subsequent to the time of the
interview, and was intended, doubtless, to afford his pupil full
opportunity for consultation before requesting her signature:


   |=This Indenture=|, Made this nineteenth day of November, A. D.1853, by John Pollexfen, photographer, of the first part, and
   Lucile Marmont, artiste, of the second part, both of the city of
   San Francisco, and State of California, WITNESSETH:

   WHEREAS, the party of the first part is desirous of obtaining a
   living, sentient, human eye, of perfect organism, and
   unquestioned strength, for the sole purpose of chemical analysis
   and experiment in the lawful prosecution of his studies as
   photograph chemist.AND WHEREAS, the party of the second part can
   supply the desideratum aforesaid.AND WHEREAS FURTHER, the first
   party is willing to purchase, and the second party willing to
   sell the same:

   Now, THEREFORE, the said John Pollexfen, for and in consideration
   of such eye, to be by him safely and instantaneously removed from
   its left socket, at the rooms of said Pollexfen, on Monday,
   November 19, at the hour of eleven o'clock P. M., hereby
   undertakes, promises and agrees, to pay unto the said Lucile
   Marmont, in current coin of the United States, in advance, the
   full and just sum of seven thousand five hundred dollars.AND the
   said Lucile Marmont, on her part, hereby agrees and covenants to
   sell, and for and in consideration of the said sum of seven
   thousand and five hundred dollars, does hereby sell, unto the
   said Pollexfen, her left eye, as aforesaid, to be by him
   extracted, in time, place and manner above set forth; only
   stipulating on her part, further, that said money shall be
   deposited in the Bank of Page, Bacon & Co.on the morning of that
   day, in the name of her attorney and agent, Thomas J. Falconer,
   Esq., for her sole and separate use.As witness our hands and seals, this nineteenth day of November,
   A. D.(Signed)                  JOHN POLLEXFEN, [L.Having finished the perusal, the photographer looked up, and the eyes of
his pupil encountered his own.And here terminates the third phase in the history of John Pollexfen.The confronting glance of the master and his pupil was not one of those
casual encounters of the eye which lasts but for a second, and
terminates in the almost instantaneous withdrawal of the vanquished orb.On the contrary, the scrutiny was long and painful.Each seemed
determined to conquer, and both knew that flight was defeat, and
quailing ruin.The photographer felt a consciousness of superiority in
himself, in his cause and his intentions.These being pure and
commendable, he experienced no sentiment akin to the weakness of guilt.The girl, on the other hand, struggled with the emotions of terror,
curiosity and defiance.She, "Is this man
in earnest?"Neither seemed inclined to speak, yet both grew impatient.Nature finally vindicated her own law, that the most powerful intellect
must magnetize the weaker, and Lucile, dropping her eye, said, with a
sickened smile, "Sir, are you jesting?""I am incapable of trickery," dryly responded Pollexfen."A fool may be deceived, a chemist never.""And you would have the fiendish cruelty to tear out one of my eyes
before I am dead?Why, even the vulture waits till his prey is carrion.""I am not cruel," he responded; "I labor under no delusion.With the rigor of a
mathematical demonstration I have been driven to the proposition set
forth in this agreement.Men speak of _accidents_,
but a fortuitous circumstance never happened since matter moved at the
fist of the Almighty.Is it chance that the prism decomposes a ray of
light?Is it chance, that by mixing hydrogen and oxygen in the
proportion of two to one in volume, water should be the result?"She cannot," Lucile responded, "but man may.""That argues that I, too, am but human, and may fall into the common
category."I deny not that I am but mortal, but man
was made in the image of God.Truth is as clear to the perception of the
creature, _when seen at all_, as it is to that of the Creator.He moves about his little universe its sole
monarch, and with all the absoluteness of a deity, controls its motions
and settles its destiny.He may not be able to number the sands on the
seashore, but he can count his flocks and herds.He may not create a
comet, or overturn a world, but he can construct the springs of a watch,
or the wheels of a mill, and they obey him as submissively as globes
revolve about their centres, or galaxies tread in majesty the
measureless fields of space!"For years," exclaimed he, rising to his feet, and fixing his eagle
glance upon his pupil, "for long and weary years, I have studied the
laws of light, color, and motion.Why are my pictures sharper in
outline, and truer to nature, than those of rival artists around me?whilst they slavishly copied what nobler natures taught, I
boldly trod in unfamiliar paths.I invented, whilst they traveled on the
beaten highway, look at my lenses!They use glass--yes, common
glass--with a spectral power of 10, because they catch up the childish
notion of Dawson, and Harwick, that it is impossible to prepare the most
beautiful substance in nature, next to the diamond--crystalized
quartz--for the purposes of art.Yet quartz has a power of refraction
equal to 74!Could John Pollexfen sleep quietly in his bed whilst such
an outrage was being perpetrated daily against God and His universe?Yon snowy hills conceal in their bosoms treasures far
richer than the sheen of gold.With a single blast I tore away a ton of
crystal.How I cut and polished it is my secret, not the world's.The
result crowds my gallery daily, whilst theirs are half deserted.""And are you not satisfied with your success?"demanded the girl, whose
own eye began to dilate, and gleam, as it caught the kindred spark of
enthusiasm from the flaming orbs of Pollexfen.Not until my _camera_ flashes back
the silver sheen of the planets, and the golden twinkle of the stars.Not until earth and all her daughters can behold themselves in yon
mirror, clad in their radiant robes.Not until each hue of the rainbow,
each tint of the flower, and the fitful glow of roseate beauty,
changeful as the tinge of summer sunsets, have all been captured,
copied, and embalmed forever by the triumphs of the human mind!Least of
all, could I be satisfied now at the very advent of a nobler era in my
art.""And do you really believe," inquired Lucile, "that color can be
photographed as faithfully as light and shade?"_I know it._ Does not your own beautiful eye print upon
its retina tints, dyes and hues innumerable?And what is the eye but a
lens?Give me but a living, sentient,
perfect human eye to dissect and analyze, and I swear by the holy book
of science that I will detect the secret, though hidden deep down in the
primal particles of matter."Why not an eagle's or a lion's?""A question I once propounded to myself, and never rested till it was
solved," replied Pollexfen."Go into my parlor, and ask my pets if I
have not been diligent, faithful, and honest.I have tested every eye
but the human.From the dull shark's to the imperial condor's, I have
tried them all.Months elapsed ere I discovered the error in my
reasoning.'Mother,' said a
child, in my hearing, 'when the pigeons mate, do they choose the
prettiest birds?'Because, responded I, waking as from a dream, _they have no perception
of color_!The animal world sports in light and shade; the human only
rejoices in the apprehension of color.or does the ox spare the buttercup and the violet, because they
are beautiful?As the girl was about to answer, the photographer again interposed, "Not
now; I want no answer now; I give you a month for reflection."And so
saying, he left the room as unceremoniously as he had entered.The struggle in the mind of Lucile was sharp and decisive.Dependent
herself upon her daily labor, her lover an invalid, and her nearest
kindred starving, were facts that spoke in deeper tones than the thunder
to her soul.Besides, was not one eye to be spared her, and was not a
single eye quite as good as two?She thought, too, how glorious it would
be if Pollexfen should not be mistaken, and she herself should conduce
so essentially to the noblest triumph of the photographic art.A shade, however, soon overspread her glowing face, as the unbidden idea
came forward: "And will my lover still be faithful to a mutilated bride?But," thought she, "is not this
sacrifice for him?we shall cling still more closely in
consequence of the very misfortune that renders our union possible."One
other doubt suggested itself to her mind: "Is this contract legal?If so," and here her compressed lips, her dilated
nostril, and her clenched hand betokened her decision, "_if so, I
yield_!"Three weeks passed quickly away, and served but to strengthen the
determination of Lucile.At the expiration of that period, and just one
week before the time fixed for the accomplishment of this cruel scheme,
I was interrupted, during the trial of a cause, by the entry of my
clerk, with a short note from Mademoiselle Marmont, requesting my
immediate presence at the office.Apologizing to the judge, and to my
associate counsel, I hastily left the court-room.On entering, I found Lucile completely veiled.Nor was it possible,
during our interview, to catch a single glimpse of her features.She
rose, and advancing toward me, extended her hand; whilst pressing it I
felt it tremble.Falconer, and advise me as to its legality.I
seek no counsel as to my duty.My mind is unalterably fixed on that
subject, and I beg of you, as a favor, in advance, to spare yourself the
trouble, and me the pain, of reopening it."If the speech, and the tone in which it was spoken, surprised me, I need
not state how overwhelming was my astonishment at the contents of the
document.The paper fell from my hands as
though they were paralyzed.Seeing my embarrassment, Lucile rose and
paced the room in an excited manner.Finally pausing, opposite my desk,
she inquired, "Do you require time to investigate the law?""Not an instant," said I, recovering my self-possession."This paper is
not only illegal, but the execution of it an offense.It provides for
the perpetration of the crime of _mayhem_, and it is my duty, as a good
citizen, to arrest the wretch who can contemplate so heinous and inhuman
an act, without delay.he has even had the insolence to insert my
own name as paymaster for his villainy.""I did not visit your office to hear my benefactor and friend insulted,"
ejaculated the girl, in a bitter and defiant tone."I only came to get
an opinion on a matter of law.""But this monster is insane, utterly crazy," retorted I."He ought, this
moment, to be in a madhouse.""Where they did put Tasso, and tried to put Galileo," she rejoined.said I, solemnly, "are you in earnest?""Were I not, I should not be here.""Then our conversation must terminate just where it began."Lucile deliberately took her seat at my desk, and seizing a pen hastily
affixed her signature to the agreement, and rising, left the office
without uttering another syllable."I have, at least, the paper," thought I, "and that I intend to keep."I sat down and addressed a most pressing letter
to Mr.Courtland, informing him fully of the plot of the lunatic, for so
I then regarded him, and urged him to hasten to San Francisco without a
moment's delay.Then, seizing my hat, I made a most informal call on Dr.White, and consulted him as to the best means of breaking through the
conspiracy.We agreed at once that, as Pollexfen had committed no overt
act in violation of law, he could not be legally arrested, but that
information must be lodged with the chief of police, requesting him to
detail a trustworthy officer, whose duty it should be to obey us
implicitly, and be ready to act at a moment's notice.All this was done, and the officer duly assigned for duty.We explained to him fully the nature of the business
intrusted to his keeping, and took great pains to impress upon him the
necessity of vigilance and fidelity.He entered into the scheme with
alacrity, and was most profuse in his promises.Our settled plan was to meet at the outer door of the photographer's
gallery, at half-past ten o'clock P. M., on the 19th of November, 1853,
and shortly afterwards to make our way, by stratagem or force, into the
presence of Pollexfen, and arrest him on the spot.We hoped to find such
preparations on hand as would justify the arrest, and secure his
punishment.If not, Lucile was to be removed, at all events, and
conducted to a place of safety.During the
week we had frequent conferences, and Cloudsdale effected an entrance,
on two occasions, upon some slight pretext, into the room of the artist.But he could discover nothing to arouse suspicion; so, at least, he
informed us.During the morning of the 19th, a warrant of arrest was
duly issued, and lodged in the hands of Cloudsdale for execution.He
then bade us good morning, and urged us to be promptly on the ground at
half-past ten.He told us that he had another arrest to make on the
Sacramento boat, when she arrived, but would not be detained five
minutes at the police office.This was annoying, but we submitted with
the best grace possible.During the afternoon, I got another glimpse at our "trusty."The steamer
left for Panama at one P. M., and I went on board to bid adieu to a
friend who was a passenger.Cloudsdale was also there, and seemed anxious and restive.He told me
that he was on the lookout for a highway robber, who had been tracked to
the city, and it might be possible that he was stowed away secretly on
the ship.Having business up town, I soon left, and went away with a
heavy heart.As night approached I grew more and more nervous, for the party most
deeply interested in preventing this crime had not made his appearance.Sickness or the miscarriage of
my letter, was doubtless the cause.The Doctor and myself supped together, and then proceeded to my
chambers, where we armed ourselves as heavily as though we were about to
fight a battle.The enormity of Pollexfen's
contemplated crime struck us dumb.The evening, however, wore painfully
away, and finally our watches pointed to the time when we should take
our position, as before agreed upon.This we did not specially notice then;
but when five, then ten, and next, fifteen minutes elapsed, and the
officer still neglected to make his appearance, our uneasiness became
extreme.Twenty--_twenty-five_ minutes passed; still Cloudsdale was
unaccountably detained."Can he be already in the rooms above?"exclaimed I, almost
frantically."We have no time to spare in discussion," replied the Doctor, and,
advancing, we tried the door.We had brought a
step-ladder, to enter by the window, if necessary.Next, we endeavored
to hoist the window; it was nailed down securely.Leaping to the ground
we made an impetuous, united onset against the door; but it resisted all
our efforts to burst it in.Acting now with all the promptitude demanded
by the occasion, we mounted the ladder, and by a simultaneous movement
broke the sash, and leaped into the room.Groping our way hurriedly to
the stairs, we had placed our feet upon the first step, when our ears
were saluted with one long, loud, agonizing shriek.The next instant we
rushed into the apartment of Lucile, and beheld a sight that seared our
own eyeballs with horror, and baffles any attempt at description.Before our faces stood the ferocious demon, holding in his arms the
fainting girl, and hurriedly clipping, with a pair of shears, the last
muscles and integuments which held the organ in its place.White, and instantly grappled
with the giant.The work had been
done; the eye torn, bleeding, from its socket, and just as the Doctor
laid his arm upon Pollexfen, the ball fell, dripping with gore, into his
left hand.PHASE THE FIFTH, AND LAST."Monster," cried I, "we arrest you for the crime of mayhem.""Perhaps, gentlemen," said the photographer, "you will be kind enough to
exhibit your warrant."As he said this, he drew from his pocket with his
right hand, the writ of arrest which had been intrusted to Cloudsdale,
and deliberately lighting it in the candle, burned it to ashes before we
could arrest his movement.Lucile had fallen upon a ready prepared bed,
in a fit of pain, and fainting.The Doctor took his place at her side,
his own eyes streaming with tears, and his very soul heaving with
agitation.As for me, my heart was beating as audibly as a drum.With one hand I
grappled the collar of Pollexfen, and with the other held a cocked
pistol at his head.Not a nerve trembled nor a tone
faltered, as he spoke these words: "I am most happy to see you,
gentlemen; especially the Doctor, for he can relieve me of the duties of
surgeon.You, sir, can assist him as nurse."And shaking off my hold as
though it had been a child's, he sprang into the laboratory adjoining,
and locked the door as quick as thought.The insensibility of Lucile did not last long.Consciousness returned
gradually, and with it pain of the most intense description.Still she
maintained a rigidness of feature, and an intrepidity of soul that
excited both sorrow and admiration.was all we
could utter, and even that spoken in whispers.Suddenly a noise in the
laboratory attracted attention."Two to one in measure; eight to one in weight; water, only water,"
soliloquized the photographer.Then silence, "Phosphorus; yellow in
color; burns in oxygen."cried I, "Doctor, he is analyzing her eye!The fiend is
actually performing his incantations!"A sudden, sharp explosion; then a fall, as if a chair
had been upset, and----

"Carbon in combustion!in a wild, excited tone,
broke from the lips of Pollexfen, and the instant afterwards he stood at
the bedside of his pupil.At the sound of his voice the girl lifted herself from her pillow,
whilst he proceeded: "Carbon in combustion; I saw it ere the light died
from the eyeball."A smile lighted the pale face of the girl as she faintly responded,
"Regulus gave both eyes for his country; I have given but one for my
art."Pressing both hands to my throbbing brow, I asked myself, "Can this be
real?If real, why do I not assassinate the fiend?Doctor,"
said I, "we must move Lucile."Not so," responded Pollexfen; the excitement of motion might bring on
erysipelas, or still worse, _tetanus_.A motion from Lucile brought me to her bedside.Taking from beneath her
pillow a bank deposit-book, and placing it in my hands, she requested me
to hand it to Courtland the moment of his arrival, which she declared
would be the 20th, and desire him to read the billet attached to the
banker's note of the deposit."Tell him," she whispered, "not to love me
less in my mutilation;" and again she relapsed into unconsciousness.The photographer now bent over the senseless form of his victim, and
muttering, "Yes, carbon in combustion," added, in a softened tone, "Poor
girl!"As he lifted his face, I detected a solitary tear course down
his impressive features."The first I have shed," said he, sternly,
"since my daughter's death."Saying nothing, I could only think--"And this wretch once had a child!"The long night through we stood around her bed.With the dawn, Martha,
the housekeeper, returned, and we then learned, for the first time, with
what consummate skill Pollexfen had laid all his plans.For even the
housekeeper had been sent out of the way, and on a fictitious pretense
that she was needed at the bedside of a friend, whose illness was
feigned for the occasion.Nor was the day over before we learned with
certainty, but no longer with surprise, that Cloudsdale was on his way
to Panama, with a bribe in his pocket.As soon as it was safe to remove Lucile, she was borne on a litter to
the hospital of Dr.Peter Smith, where she received every attention that
her friends could bestow.Knowing full well, from what Lucile had told me, that Courtland would be
down in the Sacramento boat, I awaited his arrival with the greatest
impatience.I could only surmise what would be his course.But judging
from my own feelings, I could not doubt that it would be both desperate
and decisive.Finally, the steamer rounded to, and the next moment the pale, emaciated
form of the youth sank, sobbing, into my arms.Eagerly, most eagerly, Courtland read the
little note accompanying the bankbook.It was very simple, and ran thus:

   MY OWN LIFE'S LIFE: Forgive the first, and only act, that you
   will ever disapprove of in the conduct of your mutilated but
   loving Lucile.can I still hope for your love, in the future,
   as in the past?Give me but that assurance, and death itself
   would be welcome.L. M.

We parted very late; he going to a hotel, I to the bedside of the
wounded girl.Our destinies would have been reversed, but the surgeon's
order was imperative, that she should see no one whose presence might
conduce still further to bring on inflammation of the brain.The next day, Courtland was confined to his bed until late in the
afternoon, when he dressed, and left the hotel.I saw him no more until
the subsequent day.About eight o'clock in the evening of the 21st, the day after his
arrival, Courtland staggered into the gallery, or rather the den of John
Pollexfen.He had no other arms than a short double-edged dagger, and
this he concealed in his sleeve.They had met before; as he sometimes went there, anterior to the death
of M. Marmont, to obtain the photographs upon which Lucile was
experimenting, previous to her engagement by the artist.Pollexfen manifested no surprise at his visit; indeed, his manner
indicated that it had been anticipated."You have come into my house, young man," slowly enunciated the
photographer, "to take my life.""I do not deny it," replied Courtland.As he said this, he took a step forward.Pollexfen threw open his vest,
raised himself to his loftiest height, and solemnly said: "Fire!as the case may be; I shall offer no resistance.I only beg of
you, as a gentleman, to hear me through before you play the part of
assassin.""I will hear you," said
Courtland, sinking into a chair, already exhausted by his passion.Confronting the lover, he told his story
truthfully to the end.He plead for his life; for he felt the proud
consciousness of having performed an act of duty that bordered upon the
heroic.Still, there was no relenting in the eye of Courtland.It had that
expression in it that betokens blood.Caesar saw it as Brutus lifted his
dagger.Henry of Navarre recognized it as the blade of Ravillac sank
into his heart.Joaquin beheld it gleaming in the vengeful orbs of Harry
Love!Pollexfen, too, understood the language that it spoke.Dropping his hands, and taking one stride toward the young man, he
sorrowfully said: "I have but one word more to utter.Your affianced
bride has joyfully sacrificed one of her lustrous eyes to science.In
doing so, she expressed but one regret, that you, whom she loved better
than vision, or even life, might, as the years roll away, forget to love
her in her mutilation as you did in her beauty.Perfect yourself, she
feared mating with imperfection might possibly estrange your heart.Your
superiority in personal appearance might constantly disturb the perfect
equilibrium of love."The covert meaning was seized with lightning rapidity by
Courtland.Springing to his feet, he exclaimed joyfully: "The sacrifice
must be mutual.God never created a soul that could outdo Charles
Courtland's in generosity."Flinging his useless dagger upon the floor, he threw himself into the
already extended arms of the photographer, and begged him "to be quick
with the operation."The artist required no second invitation, and ere
the last words died upon his lips, the sightless ball of his left eye
swung from its socket.There was no cry of pain; no distortion of the young man's features with
agony; no moan, or sob, or sigh.As he closed firmly his right eye, and
compressed his pallid lips, a joyous smile lit up his whole countenance
that told the spectator how superior even human love is to the body's
anguish; how willingly the severest sacrifice falls at the beck of
honor!I shall attempt no description of the manner in which I received the
astounding news from the lips of the imperturbable Pollexfen; nor
prolong this narrative by detailing the meeting of the lovers, their
gradual recovery, their marriage, and their departure for the vales of
Dauphiny.It is but just to add, however, that Pollexfen added two
thousand five hundred dollars to the bank account of Mademoiselle
Marmont, on the day of her nuptials, as a bridal present, given, no
doubt, partially as a compensation to the heroic husband for his
voluntary mutilation.Long months elapsed after the departure of Lucile and her lover before
the world heard anything more of the photographer.One day, however, in the early spring of the next season, it was
observed that Pollexfen had opened a new and most magnificent gallery
upon Montgomery Street, and had painted prominently upon his sign, these
words:

    +----------------------------------------------------+
    |          JOHN POLLEXFEN, PHOTOGRAPHER.|
    |                                                    |
    |       _Discoverer of the Carbon Process,           |
    | By which  Pictures are Painted by the Sun._ |
    +----------------------------------------------------+

The news of this invention spread, in a short time, over the whole
civilized world; and the Emperor Napoleon the Third, with the liberality
characteristic of great princes, on hearing from the lips of Lucile a
full account of this wonderful discovery, revived, in favor of John
Pollexfen, the pension which had been bestowed upon Niepce, and which
had lapsed by his death, in 1839; and with a magnanimity that would have
rendered still more illustrious his celebrated uncle, revoked the decree
of forfeiture against the estates of M. Marmont, and bestowed them, with
a corresponding title of nobility, upon Lucile and her issue.I trust the patient reader will excuse its length,
for it was all necessary, in order to explain how John Pollexfen made
his fortune.[Decoration]

VI._THE LOVE KNOT._


    Upon my bosom lies
      A knot of blue and gray;
    You ask me why tears fill my eyes
      As low to you I say:

    "I had two brothers once,
      Warmhearted, bold and gay;
    They left my side--one wore the blue,
      The other wore the gray.One rode with "Stonewall" and his men,
      And joined his fate with Lee;
    The other followed Sherman's march,
      Triumphant to the sea.Both fought for what they deemed the right,
      And died with sword in hand;
    One sleeps amid Virginia's hills,
      And one in Georgia's land.Why should one's dust be consecrate,
      The other's spurned with scorn--
    Both victims of a common fate,
      Twins cradled, bred and born?tell me not--a patriot one,
      A traitor vile the other;
    John was my mother's favorite son,
      But Eddie was my brother.The same sun shines above their graves,
      My love unchanged must stay--
    And so upon my bosom lies
      Love's knot of blue and gray."_THE AZTEC PRINCESS._

"Speaking marble."--BYRON.CHAPTER I.

In common with many of our countrymen, my attention has been powerfully
drawn to the subject of American antiquities, ever since the publication
of the wonderful discoveries made by Stephens and Norman Among the ruins
of Uxmal and Palenque.Yucatan and Chiapas have always spoken to my imagination more forcibly
than Egypt or Babylon; and in my early dreams of ambition I aspired to
emulate the fame of Champollion _le Jeune_, and transmit my name to
posterity on the same page with that of the decipherer of the
hieroglyphics on the pyramids of Ghizeh.The fame of warriors and statesmen is transient and mean, when compared
to that of those literary colossii whose herculean labors have turned
back upon itself the tide of oblivion, snatched the scythe from the
hands of Death, and, reversing the duties of the fabled Charon, are now
busily engaged in ferrying back again across the Styx the shades of the
illustrious dead, and landing them securely upon the shores of true
immortality, the ever-living Present!Even the laurels of the poet and
orator, the historian and philosopher, wither, and

    "Pale their ineffectual fires"

in the presence of that superiority--truly godlike in its
attributes--which, with one wave of its matchless wand, conjures up
whole realms, reconstructs majestic empires, peoples desolate
wastes--voiceless but yesterday, save with the shrill cry of the
bittern--and, contemplating the midnight darkness shrouding Thebes and
Nineveh, cries aloud, "Let there be light!"and suddenly Thotmes starts
from his tomb, the dumb pyramids become vocal, Nimroud wakes from his
sleep of four thousand years, and, springing upon his battle-horse, once
more leads forth his armies to conquest and glory.The unfamiliar air
learns to repeat accents, forgotten ere the foundations of Troy were
laid, and resounds once more with the echoes of a tongue in which old
Menes wooed his bride, long before Noah was commanded to build the Ark,
or the first rainbow smiled upon the cloud.All honor, then, to the shades of Young and Champollion, Lepsius and De
Lacy, Figeac and Layard.Alexander and Napoleon conquered kingdoms, but
they were ruled by the living.On the contrary, the heroes I have
mentioned vanquished mighty realms, governed alone by the

    "Monarch of the Scythe and Glass,"

that unsubstantial king, who erects his thrones on broken columns and
fallen domes, waves his sceptre over dispeopled wastes, and builds his
capitals amid the rocks of Petraea and the catacombs of Egypt.#       #       #       #       #

Such being the object of my ambition, it will not appear surprising that
I embraced every opportunity to enlarge my knowledge of my favorite
subject--American Antiquities--and eagerly perused every new volume
purporting to throw any light upon it.I was perfectly familiar with the
works of Lord Kingsborough and Dr.Robertson before I was fifteen years
of age, and had studied the explorations of Bernal Diaz, Waldeck, and
Dupaix, before I was twenty.My delight, therefore, was boundless when a
copy of Stephens's travels in Yucatan and Chiapas fell into my hands,
and I devoured his subsequent publications on the same subject with all
the avidity of an enthusiast.Very early I
saw the importance of an acquaintance with aboriginal tongues, and
immediately set about mastering the researches of Humboldt and
Schoolcraft.This was easily done; for I discovered, much to my chagrin
and disappointment, that but little is known of the languages of the
Indian tribes, and that little is soon acquired.Dissatisfied with such
information as could be gleaned from books only, I applied for and
obtained an agency for dispensing Indian rations among the Cherokees and
Ouchitaws, and set out for Fort Towson in the spring of 1848.Soon after my arrival I left the fort, and took up my residence at the
wigwam of Sac-a-ra-sa, one of the principal chiefs of the Cherokees.My
intention to make myself familiar with the Indian tongues was noised
abroad, and every facility was afforded me by my hospitable friends.I
took long voyages into the interior of the continent, encountered
delegations from most of the western tribes, and familiarized myself
with almost every dialect spoken by the Indians dwelling west of the
Rocky Mountains.I devoted four years to this labor, and at the end of
that period, with my mind enriched by a species of knowledge
unattainable by a mere acquaintance with books, I determined to visit
Central America in person, and inspect the monuments of Uxmal and
Palenque with my own eyes.Full of this intention, I took passage on the steamship "Prometheus," in
December, 1852, bound from New York to Greytown, situated in the State
of Nicaragua; a point from which I could easily reach Chiapas or
Yucatan.And at this point of my narrative, it becomes necessary to digress for a
moment, and relate an incident which occurred on the voyage, and which,
in its consequences, changed my whole mode of investigation, and
introduced a new element of knowledge to my attention.It so happened that Judge E----, formerly on the Bench of the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, was a fellow-passenger.He had been
employed by the Nicaragua Transit Company to visit Leon, the capital of
Nicaragua, and perfect some treaty stipulations with regard to the
project of an interoceanic canal.Fellow-passengers, we of course became
acquainted almost immediately, and at an early day I made respectful
inquiries concerning that science to which he had of late years
consecrated his life--I mean the "Theory of Spiritual Communion between
the Two Worlds of Matter and Spirit."The judge was as communicative as
I could desire, and with the aid of two large manuscript volumes (which
were subsequently given to the public), he introduced me at once into
the profoundest arcana of the science.I read his books through with the
deepest interest, and though not by any means convinced, I was startled
and bewildered.The most powerful instincts of my nature were aroused,
and I frankly acknowledged to my instructor, that an irresistible
curiosity had seized me to witness some of those strange phenomena with
which his volumes superabounded.Finally, I extorted a promise from him,
that on our arrival at Greytown, if a favorable opportunity presented,
he would endeavor to form the mystical circle, and afford me the
privilege I so much coveted--_to see for myself_.The anticipated
experiments formed the staple of our conversation for the six weary days
and nights that our trip occupied.Finally, on the morning of the
seventh day, the low and wooded coast of Nicaragua gently rose in the
western horizon, and before twelve o'clock we were safely riding at
anchor within the mouth of the San Juan River.But here a new vexation
was in store for us.The river boats commenced firing up, and before
dark we were transferred from our ocean steamer to the lighter crafts,
and were soon afterwards leisurely puffing our way up the river.The next day we arrived at the upper rapids, where the little village of
Castillo is situated, and where we had the pleasure of being detained
five or six days, awaiting the arrival of the California passengers.This delay was exactly what I most desired, as it presented the
opportunity long waited for with the utmost impatience.But the weather
soon became most unfavorable, and the rain commenced falling in
torrents.The Judge declared that it was useless to attempt anything so
long as it continued to rain.But on the third evening he consented to
make the experiment, provided the materials of a circle could be found.We were not long in suspense, for two young ladies from Indiana, a young
doctor from the old North State (now a practicing physician in Stockton,
California), and several others, whose names I have long since
forgotten, volunteered to take part in the mysterious proceedings.But the next difficulty was to find a place to meet in.The doctor and I
started off on a tour through the village to prepare a suitable spot.The rain was still falling, and the night as dark as Erebus.Hoisting
our umbrellas, we defied night and storm.Finally, we succeeded in
hiring a room in the second story of a building in process of erection,
procured one or two lanterns, and illuminated it to the best of our
ability.Soon afterwards we congregated there, but as the doors and
windows were not put in, and there were no chairs or tables, we were
once more on the point of giving up in despair.Luckily there were
fifteen or twenty baskets of claret wine unopened in the room, and these
we arranged for seats, substituting an unhinged door, balanced on a pile
of boxes, for the leaf of a table.Our rude contrivance worked
admirably, and before an hour had rolled by we had received a mass of
communications from all kinds of people in the spirit world, and fully
satisfied ourselves that the Judge was either a wizard or what he
professed to be--a _medium_ of communication with departed spirits.It is unnecessary to detail all the messages we received; one only do I
deem it important to notice.A spirit, purporting to be that of Horatio
Nelson, rapped out his name, and stated that he had led the assault on
the Spaniards in the attack of the old Fort of Castillo frowning above
us, and there first distinguished himself in life.He declared that
these mouldering ruins were one of his favorite haunts, and that he
prided himself more on the assault and capture of _Castillo Viejo_ than
on the victory of the Nile or triumph of Trafalgar.The circle soon afterwards dispersed, and most of those who had
participated in it were, in a few minutes, slumbering in their cots.As
for myself, I was astounded with all that I had witnessed, but at the
same time delighted beyond measure at the new field opening before me.I
tossed from side to side, unable to close my eyes or to calm down the
excitement, until, finding that sleep was impossible, I hastily rose,
threw on my coat, and went to the door, which was slightly ajar.On
looking out, I observed a person passing toward the foot of the hill
upon which stood the Fort of Castillo Viejo.The shower had passed off,
and the full moon was riding majestically in mid heavens.I thought I
recognized the figure, and I ventured to accost him.He also had been unable to sleep, and declared that a sudden impulse
drove him forth into the open air.Gradually he had approached the foot of the hill, which shot up, like a
sugar-loaf, two or three hundred feet above the level of the stream, and
had just made up his mind to ascend it when I spoke to him.I readily
consented to accompany him, and we immediately commenced climbing
upwards.The ascent was toilsome, as well as dangerous, and more than once we
were on the point of descending without reaching the summit.Still,
however, we clambered on, and at half-past one o'clock A. M., we
succeeded in our effort, and stood upon the old stone rampart that had
for more than half a century been slowly yielding to the remorseless
tooth of Time.Abandoned for many years, the ruins presented the very
picture of desolation.Rank vines clung upon every stone, and half
filled up with their green tendrils the yawning crevices everywhere
gaping at us, and whispering of the flight of years.We sat down on a broken fragment that once served as the floor of a
port-hole, and many minutes elapsed before either of us spoke a word.Our thoughts recalled the terrible scenes which
this same old fort witnessed on that glorious day when the youthful
Nelson planted with his own hand the flag of St.George upon the very
ramparts where we were sitting.How long we had been musing I know not; but suddenly we heard a low,
long-drawn sigh at our very ears.Each sprang to his feet, looked wildly
around, but seeing nothing, gazed at the other in blank astonishment.We
resumed our seats, but had hardly done so, when a deep and most
anguishing groan was heard, that pierced our very hearts.I had unclosed my lips, preparatory to speaking
to my companion, when I felt myself distinctly touched upon the
shoulder.My voice died away inarticulately, and I shuddered with
ill-concealed terror.But my companion was perfectly calm, and moved not
a nerve or a muscle.Able at length to speak, I said, "Judge, let us
leave this haunted sepulchre.""Not for the world," he coolly replied."You have been anxious for
spiritual phenomena; now you can witness them unobserved and without
interruption."As he said this, my right arm was seized with great force, and I was
compelled to resign myself to the control of the presence that possessed
me.My right hand was then placed on the Judge's left breast, and his
left hand laid gently on my right shoulder.At the same time he took a
pencil and paper from his pocket, and wrote very rapidly the following
communication, addressed to me:

   The Grave hath its secrets, but the Past has none.Time may
   crumble pyramids in the dust, but the genius of man can despoil
   him of his booty, and rescue the story of buried empires from
   oblivion.Even now the tombs of Egypt are unrolling their
   recorded epitaphs.Even now the sculptured mounds of Nineveh are
   surrendering the history of Nebuchadnezzar's line.Before another
   generation shall pass away, the columns of Palenque shall find a
   tongue, and the _bas-reliefs_ of Uxmal wake the dead from their
   sleep of two thousand years.open your eyes; we shall
   meet again amid the ruins of the _Casa Grande_!At this moment the Judges hand fell palsied at his side, and the paper
was thrust violently into my left hand.I held it up so as to permit the
rays of the moon to fall full upon it, and read it carefully from
beginning to end.But no sooner had I finished reading it than a shock
something like electricity struck us simultaneously, and seemed to rock
the old fort to its very foundation.Everything near us was apparently
affected by it, and several large bowlders started from their ticklish
beds and rolled away down the mountain.Our surprise at this was hardly
over, ere one still greater took possession of us.On raising our eyes
to the moss-grown parapet, we beheld a figure sitting upon it that bore
a very striking resemblance to the pictures in the Spanish Museum at
Madrid of the early Aztec princes.It was a female, and she bore upon
her head a most gorgeous headdress of feathers, called a _Panache_.Her
face was calm, clear, and exceedingly beautiful.The nose was
prominent--more so than the Mexican or Tezcucan--and the complexion much
lighter.Indeed, by the gleam of the moonlight, it appeared as white as
that of a Caucasian princess, and were an expression full of benignity
and love.Our eyes were riveted upon this beautiful apparition, and our lips
silent.She seemed desirous of speaking, and once or twice I beheld her
lips faintly moving.Finally, raising her white, uncovered arm, she
pointed to the north, and softly murmured, "_Palenque_!"Before we could resolve in our minds what to say in reply, the fairy
princess folded her arms across her breast, and disappeared as suddenly
and mysteriously as she had been evoked from night.We spoke not a word
to each other, but gazed long and thoughtfully at the spot where the
bright vision had gladdened and bewildered our sight.By a common
impulse, we turned to leave, and descended the mountain in silence as
deep as that which brooded over chaos ere God spoke creation into being.We soon reached the foot of the hill, and parted, with no word upon our
lips, though with the wealth of untold worlds gathered up in our hearts.Never, since that bright and glorious tropical night, have I mentioned
the mysterious scene we witnessed on the ramparts of Fort Castillo; and
I have every reason to believe that my companion has been as discreet.This, perhaps, will be the only record that shall transmit it to the
future; but well I know that its fame will render me immortal.Through me and me alone, the sculptured marbles of Central America have
found a tongue.By my efforts, Palenque speaks of her buried glories,
and Uxmal wakes from oblivion's repose.Even the old pyramid of Cholula
yields up its bloody secrets, and _Casa Grande_ reveals the dread
history of its royalties.The means by which a key to the monumental hieroglyphics of Central
America was furnished me, as well as a full account of the discoveries
made at Palenque, will be narrated in the subsequent chapters of this
history."Amid all the wreck of empires, nothing ever spoke so forcibly
   the world's mutations, as this immense forest, shrouding what was
   once a great city."--STEPHENS.At daylight on the next morning after the singular adventure recorded in
the preceding chapter, the California passengers bound eastward arrived,
and those of us bound to the westward were transshipped to the same
steamer which they had just abandoned.In less than an hour we were all
aboard, and the little river-craft was busily puffing her way toward the
fairy shores of Lake Nicaragua.For me, however, the evergreen scenery of the tropics possessed no
charms, and its balmy air no enchantments.Sometimes, as the steamer
approached the ivy-clad banks, laden as they were with flowers of every
hue, and alive with ten thousand songsters of the richest and most
variegated plumage, my attention would be momentarily aroused, and I
enjoyed the sweet fragrance of the flowers, and the gay singing of the
birds.But my memory was busy with the past, and my imagination with the
future.With the Judge, even, I could not converse for any length of
time, without falling into a reverie by no means flattering to his
powers of conversation.About noon, however, I was fully aroused to the
beauty and sublimity of the surrounding scenery.We had just passed Fort
San Carlos, at the junction of the San Juan River with the lake, and
before us was spread out like an ocean that magnificent sheet of water.It was dotted all over with green islands, and reminded me of the
picture drawn by Addison of the Vision of Mirza.Here, said I to myself, is the home of the blest.These emerald islets,
fed by vernal skies, never grow sere and yellow in the autumn; never
bleak and desolate in the winter.Perpetual summer smiles above them,
and wavelets dimpled by gentle breezes forever lave their shores.Rude
storms never howl across these sleeping billows, and the azure heavens
whisper eternal peace to the lacerated heart.Hardly had these words escaped my lips, when a loud report, like a whole
park of artillery, suddenly shook the air.It seemed to proceed from the
westward, and on turning our eyes in that direction, we beheld the true
cause of the phenomenon.It had given no
admonitory notice of the storm which had been gathering in its bosom,
but like the wrath of those dangerous men we sometimes encounter in
life, it had hidden its vengeance beneath flowery smiles, and covered
over its terrors with deceitful calm.In a moment the whole face of nature was changed.The skies became dark
and lurid, the atmosphere heavy and sultry, and the joyous waters across
which we had been careering only a moment before with animation and
laughter, rose in tumultuous swells, like the cross-seas in the Mexican
Gulf after a tornado.Terror seized all on board the steamer, and the
passengers were clamorous to return to Fort San Carlos.But the captain
was inexorable, and seizing the wheel himself, he defied the war of the
elements, and steered the vessel on her ordinary course.This lay
directly to the south of Ometepe, and within a quarter of a mile of the
foot of the volcano.As we approached the region of the eruption, the waters of the lake
became more and more troubled, and the air still more difficult to
respire.Pumice-stone, seemingly as light as cork, covered the surface
of the lake, and soon a terrific shower of hot ashes darkened the very
sun.Our danger at this moment was imminent in the extreme, for, laying
aside all consideration of peril from the volcano itself, it was with
great difficulty that the ashes could be swept from the deck fast enough
to prevent the woodwork from ignition.But our chief danger was still in
store for us; for just as we had arrived directly under the impending
summit, as it were, a fearful explosion took place, and threatened to
ingulf us all in ruin.The crater of the volcano, which previously had
only belched forth ashes and lava, now sent up high into the heavens a
sheet of lurid fire.It did not resemble gases in combustion, which we
denominate flame, flickering for a moment in transitory splendor, and
then dying out forever.On the contrary, it looked more like _frozen
fire_ if the expression may be allowed.It presented an appearance of
solidity that seemed to defy abrasion or demolition, and rose into the
blue sky like a marble column of lightning.It was far brighter than
ordinary flame, and cast a gloomy and peculiar shadow upon the deck of
the steamer.At the same instant the earth itself shook like a summer
reed when swept by a storm, and the water struck the sides of the vessel
like some rocky substance.Every atom of timber in her trembled and
quivered for a moment, then grew into senseless wood once more.At this
instant, the terrific cry of "Fire!"burst from a hundred tongues, and I
had but to cast my eyes toward the stern of the ship to realize the new
peril at hand.The attention of the passengers was now equally divided
between the burning ship and the belching volcano.The alternative of a
death by flame, or by burial in the lake was presented to each of us.In a few moments more the captain, crew, and passengers, including
seventeen ladies, were engaged hand to hand with the enemy nearest to
us.Buckets, pumps, and even hats, were used to draw up water from the
lake and pass to those hardy spirits that dared to press closest to the
flames.But I perceived at once that all would prove unavailing.The
fire gained upon the combatants every moment, and a general retreat took
place toward the stem of the steamer.Fully satisfied what would be the
fate of those who remained upon the ship, I commenced preparing to
throw myself into the water, and for that purpose was about tearing one
of the cabin doors from its hinges, when the Judge came up, and accosted
me.He was perfectly calm; nor could I, after the closest scrutiny of his
features, detect either excitement, impatience, or alarm.In
astonishment I exclaimed:

"Sir, death is at the doors!"There is no danger," he replied calmly; "and even if there were, what
is this thing that we call _death_, that we should fear it?Compose
yourself, young man; there is as yet no danger.I have been forewarned
of this scene, and not a soul of us shall perish."Regarding him as a madman, I tore the door from its hinges with the
strength of despair, and rushing to the side of the ship, was in the
very act of plunging overboard, when a united shriek of all the
passengers rose upon my ear, and I paused involuntarily to ascertain the
new cause of alarm.Scarcely did I have time to cast one look at the
mountain, ere I discovered that the flames had all been extinguished at
its crater, and that the air was darkened by a mass of vapor, rendering
the sunlight a mockery and a shadow.The next moment a sheet of cool water fell upon the ship,
and in such incredible masses, that many articles were washed overboard,
and the door I held closely in my hands was borne away by the flood.The
fire was completely extinguished, and, ere we knew it, the danger over.Greatly puzzled how to account for the strange turn in our affairs, I
was ready at the moment to attribute it to Judge E----, and I had almost
settled the question that he was a necromancer, when he approached me,
and putting an open volume in my hand, which I ascertained was a
"History of the Republic of Guatemala," I read the following incident:

   Nor is it true that volcanoes discharge only fire and molten lava
   from their craters.On the contrary, they frequently shower down
   water in almost incredible quantities, and cause oftentimes as
   much mischief by floods as they do by flames.An instance of this
   kind occurred in the year 1542, which completely demolished one
   half the buildings in the city of Guatemala.It was chiefly owing
   to this cause that the site of the city was changed; the ancient
   site being abandoned, and the present locality selected for the
   capital.[A-109]

[Footnote A-109: Thompson's History of Guatemala, p.Six months after the events recorded above, I dismounted from my mule
near the old _cabilda_ in the modern village of Palenque.During that
interval I had met with the usual fortune of those who travel alone in
the interior of the Spanish-American States.The war of castes was at
its height, and the cry of _Carrera_ and _Morazan_ greeted the ear of
the stranger at almost every turn of the road.Morazan represented the
aristocratic idea, still prevalent amongst the better classes in Central
America; whilst Carrera, on the other hand, professed the wildest
liberty and the extremest democracy.The first carried in his train the
wealth, official power, and refinement of the country; the latter drew
after him that huge old giant, _Plebs._, who in days gone by has pulled
down so many thrones, built the groundwork of so many republics, and
then, by fire and sword and barbarian ignorance, laid their trophies in
the dust.Reason led me
to the side of Morazan; but early prejudices carried me over to Carrera.Very soon, however, I was taught the lesson, that power in the hands of
the rabble is the greatest curse with which a country can be afflicted,
and that a _paper constitution_ never yet made men free.I found out,
too, that the entire population was a rabble and that it made but little
difference which hero was in the ascendant.The plunder of the
laboring-classes was equally the object of both, and anarchy the fate of
the country, no matter who held the reins.Civil wars have corrupted the
whole population.The men are all _bravos_, and the women coquettes.It will be generations before those
pseudo-republicans will learn that there can be no true patriotism where
there is no country; there can be no country where there are no homes;
there can be no home where woman rules not from the throne of Virtue
with the sceptre of Love!I had been robbed eighteen times in six months; taken prisoner four
times by each party; sent in chains to the city of Guatemala, twice by
Carrera, and once by Morazan as a spy; and condemned to be shot as a
traitor by both chieftains.In each instance I owed my liberation to the
American Consul-General, who, having heard the object with which I
visited the country, determined that it should not be thwarted by these
intestine broils.Finally, as announced above, I reached the present termination of my
journey, and immediately commenced preparations to explore the famous
ruins in the neighborhood.The first want of a traveler, no matter
whither he roams, is a guide; and I immediately called at the redstone
residence of the Alcalde, and mentioned to him my name, the purport of
my visit to Central America, and the object of my present call upon him.Eying me closely from head to foot, he asked me if I had any money
("Tiene V."Poco mas de quinientos pesos."So I took a seat upon a shuck-bottom stool, and awaited the next move of
the high dignitary.Without responding directly to my application for a
guide, he suddenly turned the conversation, and demanded if I was
acquainted with Senor Catherwood or _el gobernador_.Stephens was always called Governor by the native
population in the vicinity of Palenque.)He
then informed me that these gentlemen had sent him a copy of their work
on Chiapas, and at the same time a large volume, that had been recently
translated into Spanish by a member of the Spanish Academy, named Don
Donoso Cortes, which he placed in my hands.My astonishment can be better imagined than described, when, on turning
to the title-page, I ascertained that the book was called "_Nature's
Divine Revelations_._Traducido, etc._"

Observing my surprise, the Alcalde demanded if I knew the author."Most assuredly," said I; "he is my----" But I must not anticipate.After assuring me that he regarded the work as the greatest book in the
world, next to the Bible and Don Quixote, and that he fully believed
every line in it, _including the preface_, he abruptly left the room,
and went into the court-yard behind the house.I had scarcely time to take a survey of the ill-furnished apartment,
when he returned, leading in by a rope, made of horsehair, called a
"larriete," a youth whose arms were pinioned behind him, and whose
features wore the most remarkable expression I ever beheld.Amazed, I demanded who this young man was, and why he had been
introduced to my notice.He replied, without noticing in the slightest
degree my surprise, that _Pio_--for that was his name--was the best
guide to the ruins that the village afforded; that he was taken prisoner
a few months before from a marauding party of _Caribs_ (here the young
man gave a low, peculiar whistle and a negative shake of the head), and
that if his escape could be prevented by me, he would be found to be
invaluable.I then asked Pio if he understood the Spanish language, but he evinced
no comprehension of what I said.The Alcalde remarked that the _mozo_
was very cunning, and understood a great deal more than he pretended;
that he was by law his (the Alcalde's) slave, being a Carib by birth,
and uninstructed totally in religious exercises; in fact, that he was a
neophyte, and had been placed in his hands by the Padre to teach the
rudiments of Christianity.I next demanded of Pio if he was willing to conduct me to the ruins.A
gleam of joy at once illuminated his features, and, throwing himself at
my feet, he gazed upward into my face with all the simplicity of a
child.But I did not fail to notice the peculiar posture he assumed whilst
sitting.It was not that of the American Indian, who carelessly lolls
upon the ground, nor that of the Hottentot, who sits flatly, with his
knees upraised.On the contrary, the attitude was precisely the same as
that sculptured on the _basso-rilievos_ at Uxmal, Palenque, and
throughout the region of Central American ruins.I had first observed it
in the Aztec children exhibited a few years ago throughout the United
States.The weight of the body seemed to be thrown on the inside of the
thighs, and the feet turned outward, but drawn up closely to the body.No sooner did I notice this circumstance than I requested Pio to rise,
which he did.Then, pretending suddenly to change my mind, I requested
him to be seated again.This I did to ascertain if the first attitude
was accidental.But on resuming his seat, he settled down with great
ease and celerity into the self-same position, and I felt assured that I
was not mistaken.It would have required the united certificates of all
the population in the village, after that, to convince me that Pio was a
Carib.But aside from this circumstance, which might by possibility have
been accidental, neither the color, expression, nor structure of his
face indicated Caribbean descent.On the contrary, the head was smaller,
the hair finer, the complexion several shades lighter, and the facial
angle totally different.There was a much closer resemblance to Jew than
to Gentile; indeed, the peculiar curve of the nose, and the Syrian leer
of the eye, disclosed an Israelitish ancestry rather than an American.Having settled these points in my own mind very rapidly, the Alcalde and
I next chaffered a few moments over the price to be paid for Pio's
services.This was soon satisfactorily arranged, and the boy was
delivered into my charge.But before doing so formally, the Alcalde
declared that I must never release him whilst in the woods or amongst
the ruins, or else he would escape, and fly back to his barbarian
friends, and the Holy Apostolic Church would lose a convert.He also
added, by way of epilogue, that if I permitted him to get away, his
price was _cien pesos_ (one hundred dollars).The next two hours were devoted to preparations for a life in the
forest.I obtained the services of two additional persons; one to cook
and the other to assist in clearing away rubbish and stones from the
ruins.Mounting my mule, already heavily laden with provisions, mosquito bars,
bedding, cooking utensils, etc., we turned our faces toward the
southeast, and left the modern village of Palenque.For the first mile I
obeyed strictly the injunctions of the Alcalde, and held Pio tightly by
the rope.But shortly afterwards we crossed a rapid stream, and on
mounting the opposite bank, we entered a dense forest.The trees were of
a gigantic size, very lofty, and covered from trunk to top with
parasites of every conceivable kind.The undergrowth was luxuriant, and
in a few moments we found ourselves buried in a tomb of tropical
vegetation.The light of the sun never penetrates those realms of
perpetual shadow, and the atmosphere seems to take a shade from the
pervading gloom.Occasionally a bright-plumed songster would start up
and dart through the inaccessible foliage, but more frequently we
disturbed snakes and lizards in our journey.After traversing several hundred yards of this primeval forest I called
a halt, and drew Pio close up to the side of my mule.Then, taking him
by the shoulder, I wheeled him round quickly, and drawing a large knife
which I had purchased to cut away the thick foliage in my exploration, I
deliberately severed the cords from his hands, and set him free.Instead
of bounding off like a startled deer, as my attendants expected to see
him do, he seized my hand, pressed it respectfully between his own,
raised the back of it to his forehead, and then imprinted a kiss betwixt
the thumb and forefinger.Immediately afterward, he began to whistle in
a sweet low tone, and taking the lead of the party, conducted us rapidly
into the heart of the forest.We had proceeded about seven or eight miles, crossing two or three small
rivers in our way, when the guide suddenly throw up his hands, and
pointing to a huge pile of rubbish and ruins in the distance, exclaimed
"_El Palacio_!"This was the first indication he had as yet given of his ability to
speak or to understand the Spanish, or, indeed, any tongue, and I was
congratulating myself upon the discovery, when he subsided into a
painful silence, interrupted only by an occasional whistle, nor would he
make any intelligible reply to the simplest question.We pushed on rapidly, and in a few moments more I stood upon the summit
of the pyramidal structure, upon which, as a base, the ruins known as
_El Palacio_ are situated.These ruins have been so frequently described, that I deem it
unnecessary to enter into any detailed account of them; especially as by
doing so but little progress would be made with the more important
portions of this narrative.If, therefore, the reader be curious to get
a more particular insight into the form, size, and appearance of these
curious remains, let him consult the splendidly illuminated pages of Del
Rio, Waldeck, and Dupaix.Nor should Stephens and Catherwood be
neglected; for though their explorations are less scientific and
thorough than either of the others, yet being more modern, they will
prove not less interesting.#       #       #       #       #

Several months had now elapsed since I swung my hammock in one of the
corridors of the old palace.The rainy season had vanished, and the hot
weather once more set in for the summer.I took
accurate and correct drawings of every engraved entablature I could
discover.With the assistance of my taciturn guide, nothing seemed to
escape me.Certain am I that I was enabled to copy _basso-rilievos_
never seen by any of the great travelers whose works I had read; for
Pio seemed to know by intuition exactly where they were to be found.My
collection was far more complete than Mr.Catherwood's, and more
faithful to the original than Lord Kingsborough's.Pio leaned over my
shoulder whilst I was engaged in drawing, and if I committed the
slightest error his quick glance detected it at once, and a short, rough
whistle recalled my pencil back to its duty.Finally, I completed the last drawing I intended to make, and commenced
preparations to leave my quarters, and select others affording greater
facilities for the study of the various problems connected with these
mysterious hieroglyphics.I felt fully sensible of the immense toil
before me, but having determined long since to devote my whole life to
the task of interpreting these silent historians of buried realms, hope
gave me strength to venture upon the work, and the first step toward it
had just been successfully accomplished.But what were paintings, and drawings, and sketches, without some key to
the system of hieroglyphs, or some clue to the labyrinth, into which I
had entered?For hours I sat and gazed at the voiceless signs before me,
dreaming of Champollion, and the _Rosetta Stone_, and vainly hoping that
some unheard-of miracle would be wrought in my favor, by which a single
letter might be interpreted.But the longer I gazed, the darker became
the enigma, and the more difficult seemed its solution.I had not even the foundation, upon which Dr.Young, and Lepsius, and De
Lacy, and Champollion commenced.There were no living Copts, who spoke a
dialect of the dead tongue in which the historian had engraved his
annals.There were no descendants of the extinct nations, whose sole
memorials were the crumbling ruins before me.Time had left no teacher
whose lessons might result in success.Tradition even, with her
uncertain light, threw no flickering glare around, by which the groping
archaeologist might weave an imaginary tale of the past."Chaos of ruins, who shall trace the void,
     O'er the dim fragments cast a lunar light,
     And say, '_Here was_, _or is_,' where all is doubly night?""I must except, however, the attempt to explore an aqueduct,
   which we made together.Within, it was perfectly dark, and we
   could not move without candles.The sides were of smooth stones,
   about four feet high, and the roof was made by stones lapping
   over like the corridors of the buildings.At a short distance
   from the entrance, the passage turned to the left, and at a
   distance of one hundred and sixty feet it was completely blocked
   up by the ruins of the roof which had fallen down."--INCIDENTS OF
   TRAVEL IN CHIAPAS.One day I had been unusually busy in arranging my drawings and forming
them into something like system, and toward evening, had taken my seat,
as I always did, just in front of the large _basso-rilievo_ ornamenting
the main entrance into the corridor of the palace, when Pio approached
me from behind and laid his hand upon my shoulder.Not having observed his approach, I was startled by the suddenness of
the contact, and sprang to my feet, half in surprise and half in alarm.He had never before been guilty of such an act of impoliteness, and I
was on the eve of rebuking him for his conduct, when I caught the kind
and intelligent expression of his eye, which at once disarmed me, and
attracted most strongly my attention.Slowly raising his arm, he pointed
with the forefinger of his right hand to the entablature before us and
began to whistle most distinctly, yet most musically, a low monody,
which resembled the cadencial rise and fall of the voice in reading
poetry.Occasionally, his tones would almost die entirely away, then
rise very high, and then modulate themselves with the strictest regard
to rhythmical measure.His finger ran rapidly over the hieroglyphics,
first from left to right, and then from right to left.In the utmost amazement I turned toward Pio, and demanded what he meant.Is this a musical composition, exclaimed I, that you seem to be reading?My companion uttered no reply, but proceeded rapidly with his task.For
more than half an hour he was engaged in whistling down the double
column of hieroglyphics engraved upon the entablature before me.So soon
as his task was accomplished, and without offering the slightest
explanation, he seized my hand and made a signal for me to follow.Having provided himself with a box of lucifer matches and a fresh
candle, he placed the same implements in my possession, and started in
advance.We passed into the innermost apartments of _El Palacio_, and approached
a cavernous opening into which Mr.Stephens had descended, and which he
supposed had been used as a tomb.It was scarcely high enough in the pitch to enable me to stand erect,
and I felt a cool damp breeze pass over my brow, such as we sometimes
encounter upon entering a vault.Pio stopped and deliberately lighted his candle and beckoned me to do
the same.As soon as this was effected, he advanced into the darkest
corner of the dungeon, and stooping with his mouth to the floor, gave a
long, shrill whistle.The next moment, one of the paving-stones was
raised _from within_, and I beheld an almost perpendicular stone
staircase leading down still deeper under ground.Calling me to his
side, he pointed to the entrance and made a gesture for me to descend.My feelings at this moment may be better imagined than described.My
memory ran back to the information given me by the Alcalde, that Pio was
a Carib, and I felt confident that he had confederates close at hand.The Caribs, I well know, had never been christianized nor subdued, but
roved about the adjacent swamps and fastnesses in their aboriginal
state.I had frequently read of terrible massacres perpetrated by them,
and the dreadful fate of William Beanham, so thrillingly told by Mr.Stephens in his second volume, uprose in my mind at this instant, with
fearful distinctness.But then, thought I, what motive can this poor boy
have in alluring me to ruin?Plunder surely
cannot be his object, for he was present when I intrusted all I
possessed to the care of the Alcalde of the village.These
considerations left my mind in equal balance, and I turned around to
confront my companion, and draw a decision from the expression of his
countenance.A playful smile wreathed his lips, and
lightened over his face a gleam of real benevolence, not unmixed, as I
thought, with pity.Hesitating no longer, I preceded him into those
realms of subterranean night.Down, down, down, I trod, until there
seemed no bottom to the echoing cavern.Each moment the air grew
heavier, and our candles began to flicker and grow dimmer, as the
impurities of the confined atmosphere became more and more perceptible.My head felt lighter, and began to swim.My lungs respired with greater
difficulty, and my knees knocked and jostled, as though faint from
weakness.Tramp, tramp, tramp, I heard
the footsteps of my guide behind me, and I vainly explored the darkness
before.At length we reached a broad even platform, covered over with
the peculiar tiling found among these ruins.As soon as Pio reached the
landing-place, he beckoned me to be seated on the stone steps, which I
was but too glad to do.He at once followed my example, and seemed no
less rejoiced than I that the descent had been safely accomplished.I once descended from the summit of Bunker Hill Monument, and counted
the steps, from the top to the bottom.The
estimate of the depth of this cavern, made at the time, led me to
believe that it was nearly equal to the height of that column.But there
was no railing by which to cling, and no friend to interrupt my fall, in
case of accident._Pio was behind me!_

After I became somewhat rested from the fatigue, my curiosity returned
with tenfold force, and I surveyed the apartment with real pleasure.It
was perfectly circular, and was about fifteen feet in diameter, and ten
feet high.The walls seemed to be smooth, except a close, damp coating
of moss, that age and humidity had fastened upon them.I could perceive no exit, except the one by which we had reached it.But I was not permitted to remain long in doubt on this point; for Pio
soon rose, walked to the side of the chamber exactly opposite the
stairs, whistled shrilly, as before, and an aperture immediately
manifested itself, large enough to admit the body of a man!Through this
he crawled, and beckoned me to follow.No sooner had I crept through the
wall, than the stone dropped from above, and closed the orifice
completely.I now found myself standing erect in what appeared to be a
subterranean aqueduct.It was precisely of the same size, with a flat,
cemented floor, shelving sides, and circular, or rather _Aztec-arched_
roof.The passage was not straight, but wound about with frequent
turnings as far as we pursued it.Why these curves were made, I never ascertained, although afterward I
gave the subject much attention.We started down the aqueduct at a brisk
pace, our candles being frequently extinguished by fresh drafts of air,
that struck us at almost every turn.Whenever they occurred, we paused a
moment, to reillume them, and then hastened on, as silently and swiftly
as before.After traversing at least five or six miles of this passage,
occasionally passing arched chambers like that at the foot of the
staircase, we suddenly reached the termination of the aqueduct, which
was an apartment the _fac-simile_ of the one at the other end of it.Here also we observed a stone stairway, and my companion at once began
the ascent.During our journey through the long arched way behind us, we
frequently passed through rents, made possibly by earthquakes, and more
than once were compelled to crawl through openings half filled with
rubbish, sand and stones.Indeed,
generally, the floor was wet, and twice we forded small brooks that ran
directly across the path.Behind us, and before, we could distinctly
hear the water dripping from the ceiling, and long before we reached the
end of the passage, our clothing had been completely saturated.It was,
therefore, with great and necessary caution, that I followed my guide up
the slippery stairs.Our ascent was not so tedious as our descent had
been, nor was the distance apparently more than half so great to the
surface.Pio paused a moment at the head of the stairway, extinguished
his candle, and then requested me by a gesture to do likewise.When this
was accomplished, he touched a spring and the trap-door flew open,
_upwards_.The next instant I found myself standing in a chamber but
dimly lighted from above.We soon emerged into open daylight, and there,
for the first time since the conquest of Mexico by Cortes, the eyes of a
white man rested upon the gigantic ruins of _La Casa Grande_.These ruins are far more extensive than any yet explored by travelers in
Central America.Hitherto, they have entirely escaped observation.The
natives of the country are not even aware of their existence, and it
will be many years before they are visited by the curious.Frowning on the surrounding gloom
of the forest, and the shadows of approaching night, they stretched out
on every side, like the bodies of dead giants slain in battle with the
Titans.Daylight was nearly gone, and it soon became impossible to see anything
with distinctness.For the first time, the peculiarity of my lonely
situation forced itself upon my attention.I had not even brought my side-arms with me, and I know that it was
now too late to make any attempt to escape through the forest.The idea
of returning by the subterranean aqueduct never crossed my mind as a
possibility; for my nerves flinched at the bare thought of the shrill
whistle of Pio, and the mysterious obedience of the stones.Whilst revolving these unpleasant ideas through my brain, the boy
approached me respectfully, opened a small knapsack that I had not
before observed he carried, and offered me some food.Hungry and
fatigued as I was, I could not eat; the same peculiar smile passed over
his features; he rose and left me for a moment, returned, and offered me
a gourd of water.After drinking, I felt greatly refreshed, and
endeavored to draw my companion into a conversation.He soon fell asleep, and I too, ere long, was quietly reposing
in the depths of the forest.It may seem remarkable that the ruins of _Casa Grande_ have never been
discovered, as yet, by professional travelers.But it requires only a
slight acquaintance with the characteristics of the surrounding country,
and a peep into the intricacies of a tropical forest, to dispel at once
all wonder on this subject.These ruins are situated about five miles in
a westerly direction from those known as _El Palacio_, and originally
constituted a part of the same city.They are as much more grand and
extensive than those of _El Palacio_ as those are than the remains at
Uxmal, or Copan.In fact, they are gigantic, and reminded me forcibly of
the great Temple of Karnak, on the banks of the Nile.But they lie
buried in the fastnesses of a tropical forest.One half of them is
entombed in a sea of vegetation, and it would require a thousand men
more than a whole year to clear away the majestic groves that shoot up
like sleepless sentinels from court-yard and corridor, send their
fantastic roots into the bedchamber of royalty, and drop their annual
foliage upon pavements where princes once played in their infancy, and
courtiers knelt in their pride.A thousand vines and parasites are
climbing in every direction, over portal and pillar, over corridor and
sacrificial shrine.So deeply shrouded in vegetation are these awful
memorials of dead dynasties, that a traveler might approach within a few
steps of the pyramidal mound, upon which they are built, and yet be
totally unaware of their existence.I cannot convey a better idea of the
difficulties attending a discovery and explanation of these ruins than
to quote what Mr.Stephens has said of _El Palacio_."The whole country
for miles around is covered by a dense forest of gigantic trees, with a
growth of brush and underwood unknown in the wooded deserts of our own
country, and impenetrable in any direction, except by cutting away with
a machete.What lies buried in that forest it is impossible to say of my
own knowledge.Without a guide we might have gone within a hundred feet
of all the buildings without discovering one of them."#       #       #       #       #

I awoke with a start and a shudder.Something cold and damp seemed to
have touched my forehead, and left a chill that penetrated into my
brain.How long I had been asleep, I have no means of ascertaining; but
judging from natural instinct, I presume it was near midnight when I
awoke.I turned my head toward my companion, and felt some relief on
beholding him just where he had fallen asleep.He was breathing heavily,
and was completely buried in unconsciousness.When I was fully aroused I
felt most strangely.I had never experienced the same sensation but once
before in my whole life, and that was whilst in company with Judge E----
on the stone ramparts of _Castillo Viejo_.I was lying flat upon my back, with my left hand resting gently on my
naked right breast, and my right hand raised perpendicularly from my
body.The arm rested on the elbow and was completely paralyzed, or in
common parlance, asleep.On opening my eyes, I observed that the full moon was in mid-heavens,
and the night almost as bright as day.I could distinctly see the
features of Pio, and even noticed the regular rise and fall of his
bosom, as the tides of life ebbed and flowed into his lungs.The huge
old forest trees, that had been standing amid the ruins for unnumbered
centuries, loomed up into the moonshine, hundreds of feet above me, and
cast their deep black shadows upon the pale marbles, on whose fragments
I was reposing.All at once, I perceived that my hand and arm were in rapid motion.It
rested on the elbow as a fulcrum, and swayed back and forth, round and
round, with great ease and celerity.Perfectly satisfied that it moved
without any effort of my own will, I was greatly puzzled to arrive at
any satisfactory solution of the phenomenon.The idea crossed my mind
that the effect was of _spiritual_ origin, and that I had become
self-magnetized.I had read and believed that the two sides of the human
frame are differently electrified, and the curious phases of the disease
called _paralysis_ sufficiently established the dogma, that one half the
body may die, and yet the other half live on.I had many times
experimented on the human hand, and the philosophical fact had long been
demonstrated, to my own satisfaction, that the inside of the hand is
totally different from the outside.If we desire to ascertain the
temperature of any object, we instinctively touch it with the inside of
the fingers; on the contrary, if we desire to ascertain our own
temperature, we do so by laying the back of the hand upon some isolated
and indifferent object.Convinced, therefore, that the right and left
sides of the human body are differently magnetized, I was not long in
finding a solution of the peculiar phenomenon, which at first
astonished me so greatly.In fact, my body had become an electrical
machine, and by bringing the two poles into contact, as was affected by
linking my right and left sides together, by means of my left hand, a
battery had been formed, and the result was, the paralysis or
magnetization of my right arm and hand, such being precisely the effect
caused by a _spiritual circle_,--as it has been denominated.My arm and
hand represented, in all respects, a table duly charged, and the same
phenomenon could be produced, if I was right in my conjectures.Immediately, therefore, I set about testing the truth of this
hypothesis.I asked, half aloud, if there were any spirits present.My
hand instantly closed, except the forefinger, and gave three distinctive
jerks that almost elevated my elbow from its position.A negative reply
was soon given to a subsequent question by a single jerk of the hand;
and thus I was enabled to hold a conversation in monosyllables with my
invisible companions.It is unnecessary to detail the whole of the interview which followed.I
will only add that portion of it which is intimately connected with this
narrative.Strange as it may appear, I had until this moment forgotten
all about the beautiful apparition that appeared and disappeared so
mysteriously at _Castillo Viejo_.All at once, however, the recollection
revived, and I remembered the promise contained in the single word she
murmured, "Palenque!"Overmastering my excitement, I whispered:

"Beautiful spirit, that once met me on the ramparts where Lord Nelson
fought and conquered, art thou here?"Suddenly, the branches of the neighboring trees waved and nodded; the
cold marbles about me seemed animated with life, and crashed and struck
each other with great violence; the old pyramid trembled to its centre,
as if shaken by an earthquake; and the forest around moaned as though a
tempest was sweeping by.At the same instant, full in the bright
moonlight, and standing within three paces of my feet, appeared the
Aztec Princess, whose waving _panache_, flowing garments and benignant
countenance had bewildered me many months before, on the moss-grown
parapet of _Castillo Viejo_."Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth
       Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep."Was I dreaming, or was the vision real, that my eyes beheld?This was
the first calm thought that coursed through my brain, after the terror
and amazement had subsided.Awe-struck I certainly was, when the
beautiful phantom first rose upon my sight, at Castillo; awe-struck once
more, when she again appeared, amid the gray old rains of _Casa Grande_.I have listened very often to the surmises of others, as they detailed
what _they_ would do, were a supernatural being to rise up suddenly
before them.Some have said, they would gaze deliberately into the face
of the phantom, scan its every feature, and coolly note down, for the
benefit of others, how long it "walked," and in what manner it faded
from the sight.The nerves of these very men trembled while they spoke,
and had an apparition burst at that instant into full view, these heroes
in imagination would have crouched and hid their faces, their teeth
chattering with terror, and their hearts beating their swelling sides,
as audibly as the convict hears his own when the hangman draws the black
cap over his unrepentant head.I blame no man for yielding to the dictates of Nature.He is but a fool
who feels no fear, and hears not a warning in the wind, observes not a
sign in the heavens, and perceives no admonition in the air, when
hurricanes are brooding, clouds are gathering, or earthquakes muttering
in his ears.The sane mind listens, and thwarts danger by its
apprehensions.The true hero is not the man who knows no fear--for that were
idiotic--but he who sees it, and escapes it, or meets it bravely.Was it
courage in the elder Pliny to venture so closely to the crater of
Vesuvius, whilst in eruption, that he lost his life?How can man make
war with the elements, or battle with his God?There is, in the secret chambers of every human heart, one dark weird
cell, over whose portal is inscribed--MYSTERY.There Superstition sits
upon her throne; there Idolatry shapes her monsters, and there Religion
reveals her glories.Within that cell, the soul communes with itself
most intimately, confesses its midnight cowardice, and in low whispers
mutters its dread of the supernatural.All races, all nations, and all times have felt its influences, oozing
like imperceptible dews from the mouth of that dark cavern.Vishnu heard its deep mutterings in the morning of our race, and they
still sound hollow but indistinct, like clods upon a coffin-lid, along
the wave of each generation, as it rises and rolls into the past.Plato
and Numa and Cicero and Brutus listened to its prophetic cadences, as
they fell upon their ears.Mohammed heard them in his cave, Samuel
Johnson in his bed.Poets have caught them in the

    "Shivering whisper of startled leaves,"

martyrs in the crackling <DW19>s, heroes amid the din of battle.I reply,

    "A solemn murmur in the soul
       _Tells of the world to be_,
     As travelers hear the billows roll
       Before they reach the sea."Let no man, therefore, boast that he has no dread of the supernatural.When mortal can look spirit in the face, without blanching, man will be
immortal.#       #       #       #       #

To convince myself that I did not dream, I rose upon my elbow, and
reclined for a moment in that attitude.Gradually I gained my feet, and
then stood confronting the Aztec maiden.The midnight breeze of the
tropics had set in, and by the clear moonlight I distinctly saw the
_panache_ of feathers that she wore upon her head swaying gracefully
upon the air.Convinced now, beyond all doubt, that the scene was real, the ruling
desire of my life came back in full force upon me, and I spoke, in a
hoarse whisper, the following words:

"Here lies a buried realm; I would be its historian!"The apparition, without any reply in words, glided toward me, and
approached so close that I could easily have touched her had I dared.But a sense of propriety subdued all unhallowed curiosity, and I
determined to submit passively to all that my new friend should do.This
state of mind seemed at once known to her, for she smiled approvingly,
and came still nearer to where I stood.Elevating her beautiful arm, she passed it gently over my face, her hand
just touching my features, and imparting a cool sensation to my skin.I
distinctly remember that the hand felt damp.No sooner was this done
than my nervous system seemed to be restored to its usual tone, and
every sensation of alarm vanished.My brain began to feel light and swimmy, and my whole frame appeared to
be losing its weight.This peculiar sensation gradually increased in
intensity until full conviction flashed upon me that I could, by an
effort of will, rise into the air, and fly with all the ease and
rapidity of an eagle.The idea was no sooner fully conceived, than I noticed a wavy, unsteady
motion in the figure of the Aztec Princess, and almost immediately
afterwards, I perceived that she was gradually rising from the broken
pavement upon which she had been standing, and passing slowly upwards
through the branches of the overshadowing trees.What was most
remarkable, the relative distance between us did not seem to increase,
and my amazement was inconceivable, when on casting my eyes toward my
feet, I perceived that I was elevated more than twenty yards from the
pavement where I had slept.My ascent had been so gradual, that I was entirely unaware of moving,
and now that I became sensible of it, the motion itself was still
imperceptible.Upward, still upward, I was carried, until the tallest
limbs of the loftiest trees had been left far below me.A wide and beautiful panorama now opened before me.Above,
all was flashing moonlight and starry radiance.The beams of the full
moon grew more brilliant as we cleared the vapory atmosphere contiguous
to the earth, until they shone with half the splendor of morn, and
glanced upon the features of my companion with a mellow sheen, that
heightened a thousandfold her supermundane beauty.Below, the gray old
relics of a once populous capital glimmered spectrally in the distance,
looking like tombs, shrouded by a weeping forest; whilst one by one, the
mourners lost their individuality, and ere long presented but a dark
mass of living green.After having risen several hundred feet
perpendicularly, I was enabled to form an estimate of the extent of the
forest, in the bosom of which sleep and moulder the monuments of the
aboriginal Americans.There is no such forest existing elsewhere on the
surface of this great globe.The Black
Forest of Germany, the Thuringian Forest of Saxony, the Cross Timbers of
Texas, the dense and inaccessible woods cloaking the headwaters of the
Amazon and the La Plata, are mere parks in comparison.For miles and
miles, leagues and leagues, it stretched out--north, south, east and
west.It covers an area larger than the island of Great Britain; and
throughout this immense extent of country there is but one mountain
chain, and but one river.The summits of this range have been but seldom
seen by white men, and have never been scaled.The river drains the
whole territory, but loses itself in a terrific marsh before its tide
reaches the Mexican gulf, toward which it runs.The current is
exceedingly rapid; and, after passing for hundreds of miles under the
land and under the sea, it unites its submarine torrent near the west
end of Cuba, with that of the Orinoco and the Amazon, and thus forms
that great oceanic river called the Gulf Stream.Professor Maury was
right in his philosophic conjecture as to the origin of that mighty and
resistless tide.Having attained a great height perpendicularly above the spot of our
departure, we suddenly dashed off with the speed of an express
locomotive, toward the northeast.Whither we were hastening, I knew not; nor did I trouble my mind with
any useless conjectures.I felt secure in the power of my companion, and
sure of her protection.I knew that by some unaccountable process she
had neutralized the gravitating force of a material body, had elevated
me hundreds, perhaps thousands, of feet in the atmosphere, and by some
mysterious charm was attracting me toward a distant bourne.Years
before, whilst a medical student at the University of Louisiana, the
professor of _materia medica_ had opened his course of lectures with an
inquiry into the origin and essence of gravitation, and I had listened
respectfully, but at that time doubtingly, to the theory he propounded.He stated that it was not unphilosophical to believe that the time would
arrive when the gravitating power of dense bodies would be overcome, and
balloons constructed to navigate the air with the same unerring
certainty that ships traversed the ocean.He declared that gravitation itself was not a _cause_ but an _effect_;
that it might be produced by the rotation of the earth upon its axis, or
by some undiscovered current of electricity, or by some recondite and
hitherto undetected agent or force in nature.Magnetism he thought a
species of electricity, and subsequent investigations have convinced me
that _sympathy_ or _animal magnetism_ was akin to the same parent power.By means of this latter agent I had seen the human body rendered so
light that two persons could raise it with a single finger properly
applied.More than this, I had but recently witnessed at Castillo, dead
matter clothed with life and motion, and elevated several feet into the
air without the aid of any human agency.This age I knew well to be an
age of wonders.Nature was yielding up her secrets on every hand; the
boundary between the natural and the spiritual had been broken down; new
worlds were flashing upon the eyes of the followers of Galileo almost
nightly from the ocean depths of space.Incalculable treasures had been
discovered in the most distant ends of the earth, and I, unlettered hind
that I was, did not presume to limit the power of the great Creator, and
because an act seemed impossible to my narrow vision, and within my
limited experience, to cry aloud, _imposture_, or to mutter sneeringly,
_insanity_.Before proceeding farther with the thread of this narrative, the
attention of the reader is solicited to the careful perusal of the
following extracts from Stephens's _Travels in Central America, Chiapas
and Yucatan_, published at New York in 1841.But the Padre told us more; something that increased our
   excitement to the highest pitch.On the other side of the great
   traversing range of Cordilleras lies the district of Vera Paz,
   once called Tierra de Guerra, or land of war, from the warlike
   character of its aboriginal inhabitants.Three times the
   Spaniards were driven back in their attempt to conquer it.[A-133]

   The rest of the Tierra de Guerra never was conquered; and at this
   day the northeastern section bounded by the range of the
   Cordilleras and the State of Chiapa is occupied by Cadones, or
   unbaptized Indians, who live as their fathers did, acknowledging
   no submission to the Spaniards, and the government of Central
   America does not pretend to exercise any control over them.But
   the thing that roused us was the assertion by the Padre that four
   days on the road to Mexico, on the other side of the Great
   Sierra, was a LIVING CITY, large and populous, occupied by
   Indians, precisely in the same state as before the discovery of
   America.He had heard of it many years before, at the village of
   Chajal, and was told by the villagers that from the topmost
   ridge of the Sierra this city was distinctly visible.He was then
   young, and with much labor climbed to the naked summit of the
   Sierra, from which, at a height of ten or twelve thousand feet,
   he looked over an immense plain extending to Yucatan and the Gulf
   of Mexico, and saw at a great distance a large city, spread over
   a great space, and with turrets white and glittering in the sun.The traditionary account of the Indians of Chajal is, that no
   white man has ever reached the city; that the inhabitants speak
   the Maya language; are aware that a race of strangers has
   conquered the whole country around, and murder any white man who
   attempts to enter their territory.They have no coin or other
   circulating medium; no horses, cattle, mules, or other domestic
   animals, except fowls, and the cocks they keep under ground to
   prevent their crowing being heard.[B-134]

[Footnote A-133: Page 193, Vol.Stephens then adds:

   One look at that city is worth ten years of an every-day life.If
   he is right, a place is left where Indians and an Indian city
   exist as Cortez and Alvarado found them.There are living men who
   can solve the mystery that hangs over the ruined cities of
   America; perhaps, who can go to Copan and Palenque and read the
   inscriptions on their monuments.*       *       *       *       *

The moon, long past the meridian, was sinking slowly to her western
goal, whilst the east was already beginning to blush and redden with the
dawn.Before us rose high and clear three distinct mountain peaks,
covered with a mantle of snow.But our
pace did not slacken, nor our altitude diminish.On the contrary, we
began to rise gradually, until we found ourselves nearly upon a level
with the three peaks.Selecting an opening or gap betwixt the two
westernmost, we glided through like the wind.I shivered and my teeth
chattered as we skimmed along those everlasting snows.Here, thought I,
the condor builds his nest in summer, and the avalanches find a home.The eagle's wing has not strength enough to battle with this thin and
freezing atmosphere, and no living thing but "the proud bird, the condor
of the Andes," ever scaled these hoary summits.Gradually, as the morning broke, the region of ice
and snow was left behind us, and just as the first ray of the rising sun
shot over the peaks we had but a moment before surmounted, I beheld,
glittering in the dim and shadowy distance, the white walls of a
magnificent city.An exclamation of surprise and pleasure involuntarily
escaped my lips; but one glance at my companion checked all further
utterance.She raised her rounded forefinger to her lip, and made a
gesture, whose purport I well understood.We swept over forests and cornfields and vineyards, the city growing
upon the vision every moment, and rising like the Mexican capital, when
first beheld by Europeans from the bosom of a magnificent lake.Finally,
we found ourselves immediately above it, and almost at the same moment,
began to descend.In a few seconds I stood alone, in a large open space,
surrounded upon all sides by lofty stone edifices, erected upon huge
pyramidal structures, that resembled the forest-covered mounds at
Palenque.The day had fully dawned, but I observed no inhabitants.Presently a single individual appeared upon one of the towers near me,
and gave a loud, shrill whistle, such as we sometimes hear in crowded
theatres.In an instant it was echoed and re-echoed a thousand times,
upon every side, and immediately the immense city seemed to be awake, as
if by magic.They poured by thousands into the open square, where I
stood petrified with astonishment.Before me, like a vision of
midnight, marched by, in almost countless throngs, battalion on
battalion of a race of men deemed and recorded extinct by the wisest
historians.They presented the most picturesque appearance imaginable, dressed
apparently in holiday attire, and keeping step to a low air, performed
on instruments emitting a dull, confused sound, that seldom rose so as
to be heard at any great distance.They continued promenading the square, until the first level ray of
sunshine fell upon the great Teocallis--as it was designated by the
Spaniards--then with unanimous action they fell upon their faces,
striking their foreheads three times upon the mosaic pavement.Just as
they rose to their feet, I observed four persons, most gorgeously
dressed, descending the steps of the Temple, bearing a palanquin, in
which sat a single individual.My attention was at once arrested by her
appearance, for she was a woman.She was arrayed in a _panache_, or
head-dress, made entirely of the plumage of the _Quezale_, the royal
bird of Quiche.It was by far the most tasteful and becoming ornament to
the head I ever beheld, besides being the most magnificent.It is
impossible to describe the graceful movement of those waving plumes, as
they were stirred by the slightest inclination of the head, or the
softest aspiration of the breeze.But the effect was greatly heightened
by the constant change of color which they underwent.Blue and crimson,
and orange and gold, were so blended that the eye was equally dazzled
and delighted.But the utmost astonishment pervaded me, when, upon
closely scrutinizing her features, I thought I recognized the beautiful
face of the Aztec Princess.Little leisure, however, was afforded me for
this purpose, for no sooner had her subjects, the assembled thousands,
bowed with deferential respect to their sovereign, than a company of
drilled guards marched up to where I stood, and unresistingly made me
prisoner.It is useless to attempt a full description of the imposing ceremony I
had witnessed, or to portray the appearance of those who took the most
prominent parts.Their costume corresponded precisely with that of the
figures in _bas-relief_ on the sculptured monuments at Palenque.Each
wore a gorgeous head-dress, generally of feathers, carried an instrument
decorated with ribbons, feathers and skins, which appeared to be a
war-club, and wore huge sashes of yellow, green, or crimson cotton
cloth, knotted before and behind, and falling in graceful folds almost
to the ground.Hitherto not a word had been spoken.The ceremony I had witnessed was a
religious one, and was at once interpreted by me to be the worship of
the sun.I remembered well that the ancient Peruvians were heliolaters,
and my imagination had been dazzled when but a child by the gorgeous
description given by the historian Robertson, of the great Temple of the
Sun at Cuzco.There the Incas had worshiped the God of Day from the
period when Manco Capac came from the distant Island of Oello, and
taught the native Indians the rudiments of civilization, until the life
of the last scion of royal blood was sacrificed to the perfidy of the
Spanish invaders.These historical facts had long been familiar to my
mind; but I did not recollect any facts going to show that the ancient
Aztecs were likewise heliolaters; but further doubt was now impossible.In perfect silence I was hurried up the stone steps of the great
Teocallis, toward the palace erected upon its summit, into whose broad
and lofty corridors we soon entered.These we traversed in several
directions, leaving the more outward and gradually approaching the
heart or central apartments.Finally, I was ushered into one of the most magnificently decorated
audience-chambers that the eye of man ever beheld.We were surrounded by immense tablets of _bas-reliefs_ sculptured in
white and black marble, and presenting, evidently, a connected history
of the ancient heroes of the race.Beside each tablet triple rows of
hieroglyphics were carved in the solid stone, unquestionably giving in
detail the history of the hero or chief whose likeness stood near them.Many of these appeared to be females, but, judging from the sceptre each
carried, I was persuaded that the old _Salique_ law of France and other
European nations never was acknowledged by the aboriginal Americans.The roof was high, and decorated with the plumage of the Quezale and
other tropical birds, whilst a throne was erected in the centre of the
apartment, glittering in gold and silver ornaments, hung about with
beautiful shells, and lined with the skins of the native leopard,
prepared in the most exquisite style.Seated upon a throne, I recognized the princess whose morning devotions
I had just witnessed.At a gesture, I was carried up close to the foot
of the throne.After closely inspecting her features, I satisfied myself that she was
not the companion of my mysterious journey, being several years older in
appearance, and of a darker complexion.Still, there was a very striking
resemblance between them, and it was evident that they not only belonged
to the same race, but to the same family.I looked up at her with great
respect, anticipating some encouraging word or sign.But instead of
speaking, she commenced a low, melodious whistle, eying me intently
during the whole time.Ceasing, she evidently anticipated some reply on
my part, and I at once accosted her in the following terms:

"Most beautiful Princess, I am not voluntarily an invader of your realm.I was transported hither in a manner as mysterious as it was unexpected.Teach me but to read these hieroglyphics, and I will quit your
territories forever."A smile flitted across the features of the Princess as I uttered these
words; and she gave an order, by a sharp whistle, to an officer that
stood near, who immediately disappeared.In a few moments, he returned,
bringing with him a native dressed very coarsely in white cotton cloth,
and who carried an empty jar, or water tank, upon his head.He was
evidently a laborer, and, judging from the low obeisances he constantly
made, much to the amusement of the courtiers standing around, I am
satisfied that he never before in his whole life had been admitted to
the presence of his sovereign.Making a gesture to the officer who had introduced him, he spoke a few
low words to the native, who immediately turned toward me, and uttered,
slowly and distinctly, the following sentence:

"Ix-itl hua-atl zi-petl poppicobatl."Several other attempts to communicate with
me were made, both by the Princess and the interpreter, but all to no
purpose.I could neither understand the melodies nor the jargon.But I
noticed throughout all these proceedings that there seemed to be two
entirely distinct modes of expression; the first by whistling, and the
second by utterance.The idea at once flashed across my mind, that there
were two languages used in the country--one sacred to the blood royal
and the nobility, and the other used by the common people.Impressed
with this thought, I immediately set about verifying it by experiment.It is unnecessary to detail the ingenious methods I devised to ascertain
this fact.It is sufficient for the present purposes of this narrative
to state, that, during the day, I was abundantly satisfied with the
truth of my surmise; and that, before night, I learned another fact,
equally important, that the hieroglyphics were written in the royal
tongue, and could be read only by those connected by ties of blood with
the reigning family.There was at first something ludicrous in the idea of communicating
thought by sound emitted in the way indicated above.In my wildest
dreams, the notion of such a thing being possible had never occurred to
my imagination.And when the naked fact was now demonstrated to me every
moment, I could scarcely credit my senses.Still, when I reflected that
night upon it, after I retired to rest, the system did not appear
unnatural, nor even improbable.Birds, I knew, made use of the same
musical tongue; and when but a boy, on the shores of the distant
Albemarle, I had often listened, till long after midnight, to the
wonderful loquacity of the common mocking-bird, as she poured forth her
summer strains.Who has not heard the turtle dove wooing her mate in
tones that were only not human, because they were more sadly beautiful?Many a belated traveler has placed his hand upon his sword-hilt, and
looked suspiciously behind him, as the deep bass note of the owl has
startled the dewy air.The cock's crow has become a synonym for a paean
of triumph.Remembering all those varieties in sound that the air is capable of,
when _cut_, as it were, by whistling, I no longer doubted that a
language could easily be constructed by analyzing the several tones and
giving value to their different modulations.The ludicrousness of the idea soon gave place to admiration, and before
I had been domiciliated in the palace of the Princess a month, I had
become perfectly infatuated with her native language, and regarded it as
the most beautiful and expressive ever spoken by man.And now, after
several years have elapsed since its melodious accents have fallen upon
my ears, I hesitate not to assert that for richness and variety of tone,
for force and depth of expression, for harmony and sweetness--in short,
for all those characteristics that give beauty and strength to spoken
thought--the royal tongue of the aboriginal Americans is without a
rival.For many days after my mysterious appearance in the midst of the great
city I have described, my fate still hung in the balance.I was examined
and re-examined a hundred times as to the mode of my entrance into the
valley; but I always persisted in making the same gestures, and pointed
to the sky as the region whence I had descended.The guards stationed at
every avenue of entrance and exit were summoned to the capital, and
questioned closely as to the probability of my having passed them
unawares; but they fully exculpated themselves from all blame, and were
restored to their forfeited posts.Gradually the excitement in the city subsided, and one by one the great
nobles were won over to credit the story of my celestial arrival in
their midst, and I believed the great object of my existence in a fair
way to be accomplished.Every facility was afforded me to learn the royal tongue, and after a
little more than a year's residence in the palace, I spoke it with
considerable fluency and accuracy.But all my efforts hitherto were vain to obtain a key to the
hieroglyphics.Not only was the offense capital to teach their alphabet
to a stranger, but equally so to natives themselves, unconnected with
the blood royal.With all my ingenuity and industry, I had not advanced
a single letter.One night, as I lay tossing restlessly upon my bed, revolving this
insoluble enigma in my mind, one of the mosaic paving-stones was
suddenly lifted up in the middle of the room, and the figure of a young
man with a lighted taper in his hand stood before me.Raising my head hastily from the pillow, I almost sank back with
astonishment when I recognized in the form and features of my midnight
visitor, Pio the Carib boy."There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
       Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."I sprang to my feet with all the eagerness of joy, and was about to rush
into the arms of Pio, when he suddenly checked my enthusiasm by
extinguishing the light.I stood still and erect, like one petrified
into stone.That moment I felt a hand upon my arm, then around my waist,
and ere I could collect my thoughts, was distinctly lifted from the
ground.On touching the floor with
my feet, I was planted firmly, and the arms of my companion were tightly
drawn around my own so as to prevent me from raising them.The next
instant, and the stone upon which we stood suddenly slid from its
position, and gradually sank perpendicularly,--we still retaining our
position upon it.Our descent was not rapid, nor did I deem it very secure; for the
trap-door trembled under us, and more than once seemed to touch the
shaft into which we were descending.A few moments more and we landed
securely upon a solid pavement.My companion then disengaged his hold,
and stepping off a few paces, pronounced the words "_We are here_!"in
the royal tongue, and immediately a panel slid from the side of the
apartment, and a long passage-way, lighted at the further end by a
single candle, displayed itself to view.Into that passage we at once
entered, and without exchanging a single word, walked rapidly toward the
light.The light stood upon a stone stand about four feet high, at the
intersection of these passages.We took the one to the left, and
advanced twenty or thirty yards, when Pio halted.On coming up to him,
he placed his mouth close to the wall, and exclaimed as before.A huge block of granite swung inward, and we entered a small but
well-lighted apartment, around which were hanging several costly and
magnificent suits of Palenquin costume.Hastily seizing two of them, Pio commenced arraying himself in one, and
requested me by a gesture to don the other.With a little assistance, I
soon found myself decked from head to foot in a complete suit of regal
robes--_panache_, sash, and sandals inclusive.When all was completed, Pio, for the first time, addressed me as
follows: "Young stranger, whoever you may be, or to whatever nation you
may belong, matters but little to me.The attendant guardian spirit of
our race and country has conducted you hither, in the most mysterious
manner, and now commands me to have you instructed in the most sacred
lore of the Aztecs.Your long residence in this palace has fully
convinced you of the danger to which we are both exposed; I in
revealing and you in acquiring the key to the interpretation of the
historical records of my country.I need not assure you that our lives
are both forfeited, should the slightest suspicion be aroused in the
breasts of the Princess or the nobility."You are now dressed in the appropriate costume of a student of our
literature, and must attend me nightly at the gathering of the Queen's
kindred to be instructed in the art.Express no surprise at anything you
see or hear; keep your face concealed as much as possible, fear nothing,
and follow me."At a preconcerted signal given by Pio, a door flew open and we entered
the vestibule of a large and brilliantly illuminated chamber.As soon as we passed the entrance I saw before me not less than two
hundred young persons of both sexes, habited in the peculiar garb of
students, like our own.We advanced slowly and noiselessly, until we
reached two vacant places, prepared evidently beforehand for us.Our
entrance was not noticed by the classes, nor by those whom I afterwards
recognized as teachers.All seemed intent upon the problem before them,
and evinced no curiosity to observe the new comers.My own curiosity at
this moment was intense, and had it not been for the prudent cautions
constantly given me by Pio, by touching my robes or my feet, an exposure
most probably would have occurred the first night of my initiation, and
the narrative of these adventures never been written.My presence of mind, however, soon came to my assistance, and before the
evening was over, I had, by shrewdly noticing the conduct of others,
shaped my own into perfect conformity with theirs, and rendered
detection next to impossible.It now becomes necessary to digress a moment from the thread of my
story, and give an accurate description of the persons I beheld around
me, the chamber in which we were gathered, and the peculiar mode of
instruction pursued by the sages.The scholars were mostly young men and women, averaging in age about
twenty years.They all wore the emblem of royalty, which I at once
recognized in the _panache_ of Quezale plumes that graced their heads.They stood in semi-circular rows, the platform rising as they receded
from the staging in front, like seats in an amphitheatre.Upon the stage
were seated five individuals--two of the male, and three of the female
sex.An old man was standing up, near the edge of the stage, holding in
his hands two very cunningly-constructed instruments.At the back of the
stage, a very large, smooth tablet of black marble was inserted in the
wall, and a royal personage stood near it, upon one side, with a common
piece of chalk in his right hand, and a cotton napkin in the left.This
reminded me but too truthfully of the fourth book of Euclid and Nassau
Hall; and I was again reminded of the great mathematician before the
assembly broke up, and of his reply to that King of Sicily, who inquired
if there were no easy way of acquiring mathematics."None, your
Highness," replied the philosopher; "there is no royal road to
learning."Labor, I soon found, was the only price, even amongst the
Aztecs, at which knowledge could be bought.Each student was furnished
with the same species of instruments which the old man before-mentioned
held in his hands.The one held in the left hand resembled a white porcelain slate, only
being much larger than those in common use.It was nearly twenty inches
square, and was divided by mathematical lines into thirty-six
compartments.It was covered over with a thin crystal, resembling glass,
which is found in great quantities in the neighboring mountains, and is
perfectly transparent.The crystal was raised about the one eighth of an
inch from the surface of the slate, and allowed a very fine species of
black sand to move at will between them.The instrument carried in the
right hand resembled the bow of a common violin, more than anything
else.The outer edge was constructed of a beautiful yellow wood,
polished, and bent into the arc of a quarter circle; whilst a mass of
small cords, made of the native hemp, united the two ends.The method of using the bow was this: The slate was shaken violently
once or twice, so as to distribute the black sand equally over the white
surface, and then the bow was drawn perpendicularly down the edge of the
slate, very rapidly, so as to produce a quick whistling sound.The
effect produced upon the grains of sand was truly wonderful to the
uninitiated in the laws of acoustics.They arranged themselves into
peculiar figures, sometimes in the form of a semicircle, sometimes into
that of a spiral, sometimes into a perfect circle, or a cone, or a
rhomboid, or an oval, dependent entirely upon two things: first, the
place where the slate was held by the left hand; and second, the point
where the bow was drawn across the edge.As the slate was subdivided
into thirty-six compartments, by either one of which it could be held,
and as there was a corresponding point, across which the bow could be
drawn, there were seventy-two primitive sounds that might be produced by
means of this simple contrivance.Each of these sounds inherently and
necessarily produced a different figure upon the slate, and there were
consequently just seventy-two initial letters in the Aztec alphabet.A word was pronounced by
the aged teacher at the front of the stage, written upon his slate,
exhibited to the scholar at the black tablet, and by him copied upon it.The whole class then drew down their bows, so as to produce the proper
sound, and the word itself, or its initial letter, was immediately
formed upon the slate.After the seventy-two primitive letters or sounds had been learned, the
next step was the art of combining them, so as not only to produce
single words, but very often whole sentences.Thus the first
hieroglyphic carved upon the tablet, on the back wall of the altar, in
Casa No.3 (forming the frontispiece of the second volume of Stephens's
Travels in Central America), expresses, within itself, the name, date of
birth, place of nativity, and parentage, of _Xixencotl_, the first king
of the twenty-third dynasty of the Aztecs.The hieroglyphics of the Aztecs are all of them both symbolical and
phonetic.Hence, in almost every one we observe, first, the primitive
sound or initial letter, and its various combinations; and, secondly,
some symbolic drawing, as a human face, for instance, or an eagle's
bill, or a fish, denoting some peculiar characteristic of the person or
thing delineated.The men and women on the stage
were placed there as critics upon the pronunciation of each articulate
sound.They were selected from the wisest men and best elocutionists in
the kingdom, and never failed to detect the slightest error in the
pronunciation of the tutor.The royal tongue of the Aztecs is the only one now in existence that is
based upon natural philosophy and the laws of sound.It appeals both to
the eye and ear of the speaker, and thus the nicest shades of thought
may be clearly expressed.There is no such thing as _stilted_ language
amongst them, and logomachy is unknown.And here I may be permitted to observe that a wider field for research
and discovery lies open in the domain of _sound_ than in any other
region of science.The laws of harmony, even, are but imperfectly
understood, and the most accomplished musicians are mere tyros in the
great science of acoustics.There is every reason to believe that there
is an intimate but yet undiscovered link between _number_, _light_, and
_sound_ whose solution will astonish and enlighten the generations that
are to succeed our own._When God spake the worlds into being, the
globular form they assumed was not accidental, nor arbitrary, but
depended essentially upon the tone of the great Architect, and the
medium in which it resounded._

Let the natural philosophers of the rising generation direct their
especial attention toward the fields I have indicated, and the rewards
awaiting their investigations will confer upon them immortality of fame.There is a reason why the musical scale should not mount in whole tones
up to the octave; why the mind grasps decimals easier than vulgar
fractions, and why, by the laws of light, the blood-red tint should be
heavier than the violet.Let Nature, in these departments, be studied
with the same care that Cuvier explored the organization of insects,
that Liebig deduced the property of acids, and that Leverrier computed
the orbit of that unseen world which his genius has half created, and
all the wonderful and beautiful secrets now on the eve of bursting into
being from the dark domain of sound, color, and shape, will at once
march forth into view, and take their destined places in the ranks of
human knowledge.Then the science of computation will be intuitive, as it was in the mind
of Zerah Colburn; the art of music creative, as in the plastic voices of
Jehovah; and the great principles of light and shape and color divine,
as in the genius of Swedenborg and the imagination of Milton.I have now completed the outline of the sketch, which in the foregoing
pages I proposed to lay before the world.The peculiar circumstances which led me to explore the remains of the
aboriginal Americans, the adventures attending me in carrying out that
design, the mode of my introduction into the Living City, spoken of by
Stephens, and believed in by so many thousands of enlightened men, and
above all, the wonderful and almost incredible character of the people I
there encountered, together with a rapid review of their language and
literature, have been briefly but faithfully presented to the public.It but remains for me now to present my readers with a few specimens of
Aztec literature, translated from the hieroglyphics now mouldering amid
the forests of Chiapa; to narrate the history of my escape from the
Living City of the aborigines; to bespeak a friendly word for the
forthcoming history of one of the earliest, most beautiful, and
unfortunate of the Aztec queens, copied _verbatim_ from the annals of
her race, and to bid them one and all, for the present, a respectful
adieu.Before copying from the blurred and water-soaked manuscript before me, a
single extract from the literary remains of the monumental race amongst
whom I have spent three years and a half of my early manhood, it may not
be deemed improper to remark that a large work upon this subject is now
in course of publication, containing the minutest details of the
domestic life, public institutions, language, and laws of that
interesting people.The extracts I present to the reader may be relied upon as exactly
correct, since they are taken from the memoranda made upon the spot.Directly in front of the throne, in the great audience-chamber described
in the preceding chapter, and written in the most beautiful hieroglyphic
extant, I found the following account of the origin of the land:

   The Great Spirit, whose emblem is the sun, held the water-drops
   out of which the world was made, in the hollow of his hand.He
   breathed a tone, and they rounded into the great globe, and
   started forth on the errand of counting up the years.Nothing existed but water and the great fishes of the sea.The Great Spirit sent a solid star, round and
   beautiful, but dead and no longer burning, and plunged it into
   the depths of the oceans.Then the winds were born, and the rains
   began to fall.They came
   up from the star-dust like wheat and maize.The round star
   floated upon the waters, and became the dry land; and the land
   was high, and its edges steep.It was circular, like a plate, and
   all connected together.The marriage of the land and the sea produced man, but his spirit
   came from the beams of the sun.Another eternity passed away, and the earth became too full of
   people.They were all white, because the star fell into the cold
   seas, and the sun could not darken their complexions.Then the sea bubbled up in the middle of the land, and the
   country of the Aztecs floated off to the west.Wherever the star
   cracked open, there the waters rose up and made the deep sea.When the east and the west come together again, they will fit
   like a garment that has been torn.Then followed a rough outline of the western coasts of Europe and
Africa, and directly opposite the coasts of North and South America.The projections of the one exactly fitted the indentations of the other,
and gave a semblance of truth and reality to the wild dream of the Aztec
philosopher.Let the geographer compare them, and he will be more
disposed to wonder than to sneer.I have not space enough left me to quote any further from the monumental
inscriptions, but if the reader be curious upon this subject, I
recommend to his attention the publication soon to come out, alluded to
above.#       #       #       #       #

Some unusual event certainly had occurred in the city.The great plaza
in front of the palace was thronged with a countless multitude of men
and women, all clamoring for a sacrifice!Whilst wondering what could be the cause of this commotion, I was
suddenly summoned before the Princess in the audience-chamber, so often
alluded to before.My surprise was great when, upon presenting myself before her, I beheld,
pinioned to a heavy log of mahogany, a young man, evidently of European
descent.The Princess requested me to interpret for her to the stranger, and the
following colloquy took place."Who are you, and why do you invade my dominions?""My name is Armand de L'Oreille.I was
sent out by Lamartine, in 1848, as attache to the expedition of M. de
Bourbourg, whose duties were to explore the forests in the neighborhood
of Palenque, to collate the language of the Central-American Indians, to
copy the inscriptions on the monuments, and, if possible, to reach the
LIVING CITY mentioned by Waldeck, Dupaix, and the American traveler
Stephens.""Most of them returned to Palenque, after wandering in the wilderness
a few days.Five only determined to proceed; of that number I am the
only survivor."The council and the queen were not long in determining the fate of M. de
L'Oreille.It was unanimously resolved that he should surrender his life
as a forfeit to his temerity.The next morning, at sunrise, was fixed for his death.He was to be
sacrificed upon the altar, on the summit of the great Teocallis--an
offering to _Quetzalcohuatl_, the first great prince of the Aztecs.I at
once determined to save the life of the stranger, if I could do so, even
at the hazard of my own.I retired
earlier than usual, and lay silent and moody, revolving on the best
means to accomplish my end.Midnight at length arrived; I crept stealthily from my bed, and opened
the door of my chamber, as lightly as sleep creeps over the eyelids of
children.is so blotted, and saturated with saltwater, as to be
illegible for several pages.The next legible sentences are as
follows.--ED.]Here, for the first time, the woods looked familiar to me.Proceeding a
few steps, I fell into the trail leading toward the modern village of
Palenque, and, after an hour's walk, I halted in front of the _cabilda_
of the town.I was followed by a motley crowd to the office of the Alcalde, who did
not recognize me, dressed as I was in skins, and half loaded down with
rolls of MS., made from the bark of the mulberry.I related to him and
M. de Bourbourg my adventures; and though the latter declared he had
lost poor Armand and his five companions, yet I am persuaded that
neither of them credited a single word of my story.Not many days after my safe arrival at Palenque, I seized a favorable
opportunity to visit the ruins of _Casa Grande_.I readily found the
opening to the subterranean passage heretofore described, and after some
troublesome delays at the various landing-places, I finally succeeded in
reaching the very spot whence I had ascended on that eventful night,
nearly three years before, in company with the Aztec Princess.After exploring many of the mouldering and half-ruined apartments of
this immense palace, I accidentally entered a small room, that at first
seemed to have been a place of sacrifice; but, upon closer inspection, I
ascertained that, like many of those in the "Living City," it was a
chapel dedicated to the memory of some one of the princes of the Aztec
race.In order to interpret the inscriptions with greater facility, I lit six
or seven candles, and placed them in the best positions to illuminate
the hieroglyphics.Then turning, to take a view of the grand tablet in
the middle of the inscription, my astonishment was indescribable, when I
beheld the exact features, dress and _panache_ of the Aztec maiden,
carved in the everlasting marble before me._THE MOTHER'S EPISTLE._


    Sweet daughter, leave thy tasks and toys,
      Throw idle thoughts aside,
    And hearken to a mother's voice,
      That would thy footsteps guide;
    Though far across the rolling seas,
      Beyond the mountains blue,
    She sends her counsels on the breeze,
      And wafts her blessings too.To guard thy voyage o'er life's wave,
      To guide thy bark aright,
    To snatch thee from an early grave,
      And gild thy way with light,
    Thy mother calls thee to her side,
      And takes thee on her knee,
    In spite of oceans that divide,
      And thus addresses thee:


                   I.

    Learn first this lesson in thy youth,
      Which time cannot destroy,
    To love and speak and act the truth--
      'Tis life's most holy joy;
    Wert thou a queen upon a throne,
      Decked in each royal gem,
    This little jewel would alone
      Outshine thy diadem.Next learn to conquer, as they rise,
      Each wave of passion's sea;
    Unchecked, 'twill sweep the vaulted skies,
      And vanquish heaven and thee;
    Lashed on by storms within thy breast,
      These billows of the soul
    Will wreck thy peace, destroy thy rest,
      And ruin as they roll!But conquered passions were no gain,
      Unless where once they grew
    There falls the teardrop, like the rain,
      And gleams the morning dew;
    Sow flowers within thy virgin heart,
      That spring from guileless love;
    Extend to each a sister's part,
      Take lessons of the dove.But, daughter, empty were our lives,
      And useless all our toils,
    If that within us, which survives
      Life's transient battle-broils,
    Were all untaught in heavenly lore,
      Unlearned in virtue's ways,
    Ungifted with religion's store,
      Unskilled our God to praise.V.

    Take for thy guide the Bible old,
      Consult its pages fair
    Within them glitter gems and gold,
      Repentance, Faith, and Prayer;
    Make these companions of thy soul;
      Where e'er thy footsteps roam,
    And safely shalt thou reach thy goal,
      In heaven--the angel's home!_LEGENDS OF LAKE BIGLER._


I.--THE HAUNTED ROCK.A great many years ago, ere the first white man had trodden the soil of
the American continent, and before the palaces of Uxmal and Palenque
were masses of shapeless ruins--whilst the splendid structures, now
lining the banks of the Gila with broken columns and fallen domes were
inhabited by a nobler race than the cowardly Pimos or the Ishmaelitish
Apaches, there lived and flourished on opposite shores of Lake Bigler
two rival nations, disputing with each other for the supremacy of this
inland sea, and making perpetual war in order to accomplish the object
of their ambition.The tribe dwelling upon the western shore was called the Ako-ni-tas,
whilst those inhabiting what is now the State of Nevada were known by
the name of Gra-so-po-itas.Each nation was subdivided into smaller
principalities, over which subordinate sachems, or chiefs, presided.In
number, physical appearance, and advance in the arts of civilization,
both very much resembled, and neither could be said to have decidedly
the pre-eminence.At the time my story commences, Wan-ta-tay-to was principal chief or
king of the Ako-ni-tas, or, as they were sometimes designated,
O-kak-o-nitas, whilst Rhu-tog-au-di presided over the destinies of the
Gra-so-po-itas.The language spoken by these tribes were dialects of
the same original tongue, and could be easily understood the one by the
other.Continued intercourse, even when at war, had assimilated their
customs, laws and religion to such a degree that it often became a
matter of grave doubt as to which tribe occasional deserters belonged.Intermarriage between the tribes was strictly forbidden, and punished
with death in all cases, no matter what might be the rank, power or
wealth of the violators of the law.At this era the surface of the lake was about sixty feet higher than at
the present time.Constant evaporation, or perhaps the wearing channel
of the Truckee, has contributed to lower the level of the water, and the
same causes still continue in operation, as is clearly perceptible by
the watermarks of previous years.Thousands of splendid canoes
everywhere dotted its surface; some of them engaged in the peaceful
avocations of fishing and hunting, whilst the large majority were manned
and armed for immediate and deadly hostilities.The year preceding that in which the events occurred herein related, had
been a very disastrous one to both tribes.A great many deaths had
ensued from casualties in battle; but the chief source of disaster had
been a most terrific hurricane, which had swept over the lake,
upsetting, sinking, and destroying whole fleets of canoes, with all
persons aboard at the time.Amongst the lost were both the royal barges,
with the sons and daughters of the chiefs.The loss had been so
overwhelming and general that the chief of the O-kak-o-nitas had but one
solitary representative of the line royal left, and that was a beloved
daughter named Ta-kem-ena.The rival chieftain was equally unfortunate,
for his entire wigwam had perished with the exception of Mo-ca-ru-po,
his youngest son.But these great misfortunes, instead of producing
peace and good-will, as a universal calamity would be sure to do in an
enlightened nation, tended only to embitter the passions of the hostile
kings and lend new terrors to the war.At once made aware of what the
other had suffered, each promulgated a sort of proclamation, offering an
immense reward for the scalp of his rival's heir.Wan-ta-tay-to declared that he would give one half his realm to
whomsoever brought the body of Mo-ca-ru-po, dead or alive, within his
lines; and Rhu-tog-au-di, not to be outdone in extravagance, registered
an oath that whosoever captured Ta-kem-ena, the beautiful daughter of
his enemy, should be rewarded with her patrimonial rights, and also be
associated with him in ruling his own dominions.As is universally the case with all American Indians, the females are
equally warlike and sometimes quite as brave as the males.Ta-kem-ena
was no exception to this rule, and she accordingly made instant
preparations to capture or kill the heir to the throne of her enemy.For
this purpose she selected a small, light bark canoe, and resolved all
alone to make the attempt.Nor did she communicate her intention to any
one else.Her father, even, was kept in profound ignorance of his
daughter's design.About the same time, a desire for fame, and a thirsting for supreme
power, allured young Mo-ca-ru-po into the lists of those who became
candidates for the recent reward offered by his father.He, too,
determined to proceed alone.It was just at midnight, of a beautiful moonlight evening, that the
young scions of royalty set forth from opposite shores of the lake, and
stealthily paddled for the dominions of their enemies.When about half
across the boats came violently into collision.The light of the full moon, riding at mid-heavens,
fell softly upon the features of the Princess, and at the same time
illuminated those of the young Prince.The blows from the uplifted battle-axes failed to descend.The poisoned
arrows were returned to their quivers.Surprise gave place quickly to
admiration--that to something more human--pity followed close in the
rear, and love, triumphant everywhere, paralyzed the muscles, benumbed
the faculties, and captured the souls of his victims.Pouring a handful
of the pure water of the lake upon each other's heads, as a pledge of
love, and a ceremonial of marriage, in another moment the two were
locked in each other's arms, made man and wife by the yearnings of the
soul, and by a destiny which naught but Omnipotent Power could avert.What were the commands of kings, their threats, or their punishments, in
the scale with youth, and hope, and love?Never did those transparent waters leap more lightly beneath the
moonbeams than upon this auspicious night.Hate, revenge, fame, power,
all were forgotten in the supreme delights of love.Who, indeed, would not be a lover?The future takes the hue of the
rainbow, and spans the whole earth with its arch.The past fades into
instant oblivion, and its dark scenes are remembered no more.Every
beautiful thing looks lovelier--spring's breath smells sweeter--the
heavens bend lower--the stars shine brighter.The eyes, the lips, the
smiles of the loved one, bankrupt all nature.The diamond's gleam, the
flower's blush, the fountain's purity, are all _her_ own!The antelope's
swiftness, the buffalo's strength, the lion's bravery, are but the
reflex of _his_ manly soul!Fate thus had bound these two lovers in indissoluble bonds: let us now
see what it had left in reserve.The plashing of paddles aroused the lovers from their caressing.Quickly
leaping into his own boat, side by side, they flew over the exultant
waves, careless for the moment whither they went, and really aimless in
their destination.Having safely eluded their pursuers, if such they
were, the princes now consulted as to their future course.After long
and anxious debate it was finally determined that they should part for
the present, and would each night continue to meet at midnight at the
majestic rock which towered up from the waves high into the heavens, not
far from what is now known as Pray's Farm, that being the residence and
headquarters of the O-kak-oni-ta tribe.Accordingly, after many protestations of eternal fidelity, and warned by
the ruddy gleam along the eastern sky, they parted.Night after night, for many weeks and months, the faithful lovers met at
the appointed place, and proved their affection by their constancy.They
soon made the discovery that the immense rock was hollow, and contained
a magnificent cave.Here, safe from all observation, the tardy months
rolled by, both praying for peace, yet neither daring to mention a
termination of hostilities to their sires.Finally, the usual
concomitants of lawful wedlock began to grow manifest in the rounded
form of the Princess--in her sadness, her drooping eyes, and her
perpetual uneasiness whilst in the presence of her father.Not able any
longer to conceal her griefs, they became the court scandal, and she
was summoned to the royal presence and required to name her lover.This,
of course, she persisted in refusing, but spies having been set upon her
movements, herself and lover were surrounded and entrapped in the fatal
cave.In vain did she plead for the life of the young prince, regardless of
her own.An embassador was sent to Rhu-tog-au-di,
announcing the treachery of his son, and inviting that chief to be
present at the immolation of both victims.He willingly consented to
assist in the ceremonies.A grand council of the two nations was
immediately called, in order to determine in what manner the death
penalty should be inflicted.After many and grave debates, it was
resolved that the lovers should be incarcerated in the dark and gloomy
cave where they had spent so many happy hours, and there starve to
death.It was a grand gala-day with the O-kak-oni-tas and the Gra-sop-o-itas.The mighty chiefs had been reconciled, and the wealth, power and beauty
of the two realms turned out in all the splendor of fresh paint and
brilliant feathers, to do honor to the occasion.The young princes were
to be put to death.The lake in the vicinity of the rock was alive with
canoes.The hills in the neighborhood were crowded with spectators.The
two old kings sat in the same splendid barge, and followed close after
the bark canoe in which the lovers were being conveyed to their living
tomb.Silently they gazed into each other's faces and smiled.For each
other had they lived; with one another were they now to die.Without
food, without water, without light, they were hurried into their bridal
chamber, and huge stones rolled against the only entrance.Evening after evening the chiefs sat upon the grave portals of their
children.At first they were greeted with loud cries, extorted by the
gnawing of hunger and the agony of thirst.Gradually the cries gave way
to low moans, and finally, after ten days had elapsed, the tomb became
as silent as the lips of the lovers.Then the huge stones were, by the
command of the two kings, rolled away, and a select body of warriors
ordered to enter and bring forth their lifeless forms.But the west wind
had sprung up, and just as the stones were taken from the entrance, a
low, deep, sorrowful sigh issued from the mouth of the cave.Startled
and terrified beyond control, the warriors retreated hastily from the
spot; and the weird utterances continuing, no warriors could be found
brave enough to sound the depths of that dreadful sepulchre.Day after
day canoes crowded about the mouth of the cave, and still the west wind
blew, and still the sighs and moans continued to strike the souls of the
trembling warriors.In paddling past they would
always veer their canoes seaward, and hurry past with all the speed they
could command.Centuries passed away; the level of the lake had sunk many feet; the
last scions of the O-kak-oni-tas and the Gra-sop-o-itas had mouldered
many years in the burying-grounds of their sires, and a new race had
usurped their old hunting grounds.Still no one had ever entered the
haunted cave.One day, late in the autumn of 1849, a company of emigrants on their way
to California, were passing, toward evening, the month of the cavern,
and hearing a strange, low, mournful sigh, seeming to issue thence, they
landed their canoe and resolved to solve the mystery.Lighting some
pitch-pine torches, they proceeded cautiously to explore the cavern.For
a long time they could discern nothing.At length, in the furthest
corner of the gloomy recess, they found two human skeletons, with their
bony arms entwined, and their fleshless skulls resting upon each other's
bosoms.The lovers are dead, but the old cave still echoes with their
dying sobs.II.--DICK BARTER'S YARN; OR, THE LAST OF THE MERMAIDS.Well, Dick began, you see I am an old salt, having sailed the seas for
more than forty-nine years, and being entirely unaccustomed to living
upon the land.By some accident or other, I found myself, in the winter
of 1849, cook for a party of miners who were sluicing high up the North
Fork of the American.We had a hard time all winter, and when spring
opened, it was agreed that I and a comrade named Liehard should cross
the summit and spend a week fishing at the lake.We took along an old
Washoe Indian, who spoke Spanish, as a guide.This old man had formerly
lived on the north margin of the lake, near where Tahoe City is now
situated, and was perfectly familiar with all the most noted fishing
grounds and chief points of interest throughout its entire circuit.We had hardly got started before he commenced telling us of a remarkable
struggle, which he declared had been going on for many hundred years
between a border tribe of Indians and the inhabitants of the lake, whom
he designated as Water-men, or "_hombres de las aguas_."On asking if he
really meant to say that human beings lived and breathed like fish in
Lake Bigler, he declared without any hesitation that such was the fact;
that he had often seen them; and went on to describe a terrific combat
he witnessed a great many years ago, between a Pol-i-<DW76> chief and _a
man of the water_.On my expressing some doubt as to the veracity of the
statement, he proffered to show us the very spot where it occurred; and
at the same time expressed a belief that by manufacturing a whistle from
the bark of the mountain chinquapin, and blowing it as the Pol-i-<DW76>s
did, we might entice some of their old enemies from the depths of the
lake.My curiosity now being raised tip-toe, I proceeded to interrogate
Juan more closely, and in answer I succeeded in obtaining the following
curious particulars:

The tribe of border Indians called the Pol-i-<DW76>s were a sort of
amphibious race, and a hybrid between the Pi-Utes and the mermaids of
the lake.They were of a much lighter color than their progenitors, and
were distinguished by a great many peculiar characteristics.Exceedingly
few in number, and quarrelsome in the extreme, they resented every
intrusion upon the waters of the lake as a personal affront, and made
perpetual war upon neighboring tribes.Hence, as Juan remarked, they
soon became extinct after the invasion of the Washoes.The last of them
disappeared about twenty-five years ago.The most noted of their
peculiarities were the following:

First.Their heads were broad and extremely flat; the eyes protuberant,
and the ears scarcely perceptible--being a small opening closed by a
movable valve shaped like the scale of a salmon.Their mouths were very
large, extending entirely across the cheeks, and bounded by a hard rim
of bone, instead of the common lip.In appearance, therefore, the head
did not look unlike an immense catfish head, except there were no fins
about the jaws, and no feelers, as we call them.Their necks were short, stout, and chubby, and they possessed
the power of inflating them at will, and thus distending them to two or
three times their ordinary size.Their bodies were long, round, and flexible.When wet, they
glistened in the sun like the back of an eel, and seemed to possess much
greater buoyancy than those of common men.But the greatest wonder of
all was a kind of loose membrane, that extended from beneath their
shoulders all the way down their sides, and connected itself with the
upper portion of their thighs.This loose skin resembled the wings of
the common house bat, and when spread out, as it always did in the
water, looked like the membrane lining of the legs and fore feet of the
chipmunk.The hands and feet were distinguished for much greater length of
toe and finger; and their extremities grew together like the toes of a
duck, forming a complete web betwixt all the fingers and toes.The Pol-i-<DW76>s lived chiefly upon fish and oysters, of which there was
once a great abundance in the lake.They were likewise cannibals, and
ate their enemies without stint or compunction.A young Washoe girl was
considered a feast, but a lake maiden was the _ne plus ultra_ of
luxuries.The Washoes reciprocated the compliment, and fattened upon the
blubber of the Pol-i-<DW76>s.It is true that they were extremely difficult
to capture, for, when hotly pursued, they plunged into the lake, and by
expert swimming and extraordinary diving, they generally managed to
effect their escape.Juan having exhausted his budget concerning the Pol-i-<DW76>s, I requested
him to give us as minute a description of the Lake Mermaids.This he
declined for the present to do, alleging as an excuse that we would
first attempt to capture, or at least to see one for ourselves, and if
our hunt was unsuccessful, he would then gratify our curiosity.It was some days before we came in sight of this magnificent sheet of
water.Finally, however, after many perilous adventures in descending
the Sierras, we reached the margin of the lake.Our first care was to
procure trout enough to last until we got ready to return.That was an
easy matter, for in those days the lake was far more plentifully
supplied than at present.We caught many thousands at a place where a
small brook came down from the mountains, and formed a pool not a great
distance from its entrance into the lake, and this pool was alive with
them.It occupied us but three days to catch, clean, and sun-dry as many
as our single mule could carry, and having still nearly a week to spare
we determined to start off in pursuit of the mermaids.Our guide faithfully conducted us to the spot where he beheld the
conflict between the last of the Pol-i-<DW76>s and one of the water-men.As
stated above, it is nearly on the spot where Tahoe City now stands.The
battle was a fierce one, as the combatants were equally matched in
strength and endurance, and was finally terminated only by the
interposition of a small party of Washoes, our own guide being of the
number.The struggle was chiefly in the water, the Pol-i-<DW76> being
better able to swim than the mermaid was to walk.Still, as occasion
required, a round or two took place on the gravelly beach.Never did old
Spain and England engage in fiercer conflict for the dominion of the
seas, than now occurred between Pol-i-<DW76> and Merman for the mastery of
the lake.Each fought, as the Roman fought, for Empire.The Pol-i-<DW76>,
like the last of the Mohicans, had seen his tribe melt away, until he
stood, like some solitary column at Persepolis, the sole monument of a
once gorgeous temple.The water chieftain also felt that upon his arm,
or rather tail, everything that made life desirable was staked.Above
all, the trident of his native sea was involved.The weapons of the Pol-i-<DW76> were his teeth and his hind legs.Those of
the Merman were all concentrated in the flop of his scaly tail.With the
energy of a dying alligator, he would encircle, with one tremendous
effort, the bruised body of the Pol-i-<DW76>, and floor him beautifully on
the beach.Recovering almost instantly, the Pol-i-<DW76> would seize the
Merman by the long black hair, kick him in the region of the stomach,
and grapple his windpipe between his bony jaws, as the mastiff does the
infuriated bull.Finally, after a great many unsuccessful attempts to drag the Pol-i-<DW76>
into deep water, the mermaid was seized by her long locks and suddenly
jerked out upon the beach in a very battered condition.At this moment,
the Washoes with a yell rushed toward the combatants, but the Pol-i-<DW76>
seeing death before him upon water and land equally, preferred the
embraces of the water nymphs to the stomachs of the landsmen, and
rolling over rapidly was soon borne off into unfathomable depths by the
triumphant Merman.It resembled the condition of the ancient
Britons, who, being crowded by the Romans from the sea, and attacked by
the Picts from the interior, lamented their fate as the most unfortunate
of men."The Romans," they said, "drive us into the land; there we are
met by the Picts, who in turn drive us into the sea.Those whom enemies spare, the waves devour."Our first step was to prepare a chinquapin whistle.The flute was easily
manufactured by Juan himself, thuswise: He cut a twig about eighteen
inches in length, and not more than half an inch in diameter, and
peeling the bark from the ends an inch or so, proceeded to rub the bark
rapidly with a dry stick peeled perfectly smooth.In a short time the
sap in the twig commenced to exude from both ends.Then placing the
large end between his teeth he pulled suddenly, and the bark slipped off
with a crack in it.Then cutting a small hole in the form of a
parallelogram, near the upper end, he adjusted a stopper with flattened
surface so as to fit exactly the opening.Cutting off the end of the
stopple even with the bark and filling the lower opening nearly full of
clay, he declared the work was done.As a proof of this, he blew into
the hollow tube, and a low, musical sound was emitted, very flute-like
and silvery.When blown harshly, it could be heard at a great distance,
and filled the air with melodious echoes.Thus equipped, we set out upon our search.The first two days were spent
unsuccessfully.On the third we found ourselves near what is now called
Agate Beach.At this place a small cove indents the land, which sweeps
round in the form of a semi-circle.The shore is literally packed with
agates and crystals.We dug some more than two feet deep in several
places, but still could find no bottom to the glittering floor.They are
of all colors, but the prevailing hues are red and yellow.Here Juan
paused, and lifting his whistle to his lips, he performed a multitude of
soft, gentle airs, which floated across the calm waves like a lover's
serenade breathes o'er the breast of sleeping beauty.We had now entirely circumnavigated the lake, and were on the eve
of despairing utterly, when suddenly we beheld the surface of the lake,
nearly a quarter of a mile from the shore, disturbed violently, as if
some giant whale were floundering with a harpoon in its side.In a
moment more the head and neck of one of those tremendous serpents that
of late years have infested the lake, were uplifted some ten or fifteen
feet above the surface.Almost at the same instant we beheld the head,
face and hair, as of a human being, emerge quickly from the water, and
look back toward the pursuing foe.The truth flashed upon us
instantaneously.Here was a mermaid pursued by a serpent.On they came,
seemingly regardless of our presence, and had approached to within
twenty yards of the spot where we stood, when suddenly both came to a
dead halt.Juan had never ceased for a moment to blow his tuneful flute,
and it now became apparent that the notes had struck their hearing at
the same time.To say that they were charmed would but half express
their ecstatic condition.The huge old serpent lolled along the waters for a hundred feet or so,
and never so much as shook the spray from his hide.He looked like
Milton's portrait of Satan, stretched out upon the burning marl of hell.In perfect contrast with the sea monster, the beautiful mermaiden lifted
her pallid face above the water, dripping with the crystal tears of the
lake, and gathering her long raven locks, that floated like the train of
a meteor down her back, she carelessly flung them across her swelling
bosom, as if to reproach us for gazing upon her beauteous form.If she were entranced by the music, I was
not less so with her beauty.Presently the roseate hues of a dying
dolphin played athwart her brow and cheeks, and ere long a gentle sigh,
as if stolen from the trembling chords of an Eolian harp, issued from
her coral lips.Again and again it broke forth, until it beat in full
symphony with the cadences of Juan's rustic flute.My attention was at this moment aroused by the suspicious clicking of my
comrade's rifle.Turning around suddenly, I beheld Liehard, with his
piece leveled at the unconscious mermaid.But the
warning came too late, for instantaneously the quick report of his rifle
and the terrific shriek of the mermaid broke the noontide stillness;
and, rearing her bleeding form almost entirely out of the water, she
plunged headlong forwards, a corpse.Beholding his prey, powerless
within his grasp, the serpent splashed toward her, and, ere I could cock
my rifle, he had seized her unresisting body, and sank with it into the
mysterious caverns of the lake.At this instant, I gave a loud outcry,
as if in pain.On opening my eyes, my wife was bending over me, the
midday sun was shining in my face, Dick Barter was spinning some
confounded yarn about the Bay of Biscay and the rum trade of Jamaica,
and the sloop _Edith Beaty_ was still riding at anchor off the wild
glen, and gazing tranquilly at her ugly image in the crystal mirror of
Lake Bigler.[Decoration]

X._ROSENTHAL'S ELAINE._


    I stood and gazed far out into the waste;
    No dip of oar broke on the listening ear;
    But the quick rippling of the inward flood
    Gave warning of approaching argosy.Adown the west, the day's last fleeting gleam
    Faded and died, and left the world in gloom.Hope hung no star up in the murky east
    To cheer the soul, or guide the pilgrim's way.Black frown'd the heavens, and black the answering earth
    Reflected from her watery wastes the night.Once again
    The dripping oar dipped in its silver blade,
    Parting the waves, as smiles part beauty's lips.Betwixt me and the curtain of the cloud,
    Close down by the horizon's verge, there crept
    From out the darkness, barge and crew and freight,
    Sailless and voiceless, all!Then I knew
    I stood upon the brink of Time.I saw
    Before me Death's swift river sweep along
    And bear its burden to the grave.One seamew screamed, in solitary woe;
    "Elaine!stole back the echo, weird
    And musical, from off the further shore.Then burst a chorus wild, "Elaine!And gazing upward through the twilight haze,
    Mine eyes beheld King Arthur's phantom Court.There stood the sturdy monarch: he who drove
    The hordes of Hengist from old Albion's strand;
    And, leaning on his stalwart arm, his queen,
    The fair, the false, but trusted Guinevere!And there, like the statue of a demi-god,
    In marble wrought by some old Grecian hand,
    With eyes downcast, towered Lancelot of the Lake.Lavaine and Torre, the heirs of Astolat,
    And he, the sorrowing Sire of the Dead,
    Together with a throng of valiant knights
    And ladies fair, were gathered as of yore,
    At the Round Table of bold Arthur's Court.There, too, was Tristram, leaning on his lance,
    Whose eyes alone of all that weeping host
    Swam not in tears; but indignation burned
    Red in their sockets, like volcanic fires,
    And from their blazing depths a Fury shot
    Her hissing arrows at the guilty pair.Then Lancelot, advancing to the front,
    With glance transfixed upon the canvas true
    That sheds immortal fame on ROSENTHAL,
    Thus chanted forth his Requiem for the Dead:

        Fresh as the water in the fountain,
          Fair as the lily by its side,
        Pure as the snow upon the mountain,
                  Is the angel
                    Elaine!Day after day she grew fairer,
          As she pined away in sorrow, at my side;
        No pearl in the ocean could be rarer
                 Than the angel
                    Elaine!The hours passed away all unheeded,
          For love hath no landmarks in its tide.No child of misfortune ever pleaded
                    In vain
                   To Elaine!Here, where sad Tamesis is rolling
         The wave of its sorrow-laden tide,
       Forever on the air is heard tolling
                   The refrain
                   Of Elaine![Decoration]

XI._THE TELESCOPIC EYE._

A LEAF FROM A REPORTER'S NOTE-BOOK.For the past five or six weeks, rumors of a strange abnormal development
of the powers of vision of a youth named Johnny Palmer, whose parents
reside at South San Francisco, have been whispered around in scientific
circles in the city, and one or two short notices have appeared in the
columns of some of our contemporaries relative to the prodigious _lusus
naturae_, as the scientists call it.Owing to the action taken by the California College of Sciences, whose
members comprise some of our most scientific citizens, the affair has
assumed such importance as to call for a careful and exhaustive
investigation.Being detailed to investigate the flying stories, with regard to the
powers of vision claimed for a lad named John or "Johnny" Palmer, as his
parents call him, we first of all ventured to send in our card to
Professor Gibbins, the President of the California College of Sciences.It is always best to call at the fountain-head for useful information, a
habit which our two hundred thousand readers on this coast can never
fail to see and appreciate.An estimable gentleman of the African
persuasion, to whom we handed our "pasteboard," soon returned with the
polite message, "Yes, sir; _in_.And so we followed our
conductor through several passages almost as dark as the face of the
_cicerone_, and in a few moments found ourselves in the presence of,
perhaps, the busiest man in the city of San Francisco.Without any flourish of trumpets, the Professor inquired our object in
seeking him and the information we desired."Ah," said he, "that is a
long story.I have no time to go into particulars just now.I am
computing the final sheet of Professor Davidson's report of the Transit
of Venus, last year, at Yokohama and Loo-Choo.It must be ready before
May, and it requires six months' work to do it correctly.""But," I rejoined, "can't you tell me where the lad is to be found?""And if I did, they will not let you see him.""Let me alone for that," said I, smiling; "a reporter, like love, finds
his way where wolves would fear to tread.""Really, my dear sir," quickly responded the Doctor, "I have no time to
chat this morning.Our special committee submitted its report yesterday,
which is on file in that book-case; and if you will promise not to
publish it until after it has been read in open session of the College,
you may take it to your sanctum, run it over, and clip from it enough to
satisfy the public for the present."Saying this, he rose from his seat, opened the case, took from a
pigeon-hole a voluminous written document tied up with red tape, and
handed it to me, adding, "Be careful!"Seating himself without another
word, he turned his back on me, and I sallied forth into the street.Reaching the office, I scrutinized the writing on the envelope, and
found it as follows: "Report of Special Committee--Boy
Palmer--Vision--Laws of Light--Filed February 10, 1876--Stittmore,
Sec."Opening the document, I saw at once that it was a full, accurate,
and, up to the present time, complete account of the phenomenal case I
was after, and regretted the promise made not to publish the entire
report until read in open session of the College.Therefore, I shall be
compelled to give the substance of the report in my own words, only
giving _verbatim_ now and then a few scientific phrases which are not
fully intelligible to me, or susceptible of circumlocution in common
language.The report is signed by Doctors Bryant, Gadbury and Golson, three of our
ablest medical men, and approved by Professor Smyth, the oculist.So
far, therefore, as authenticity and scientific accuracy are concerned,
our readers may rely implicitly upon the absolute correctness of every
fact stated and conclusion reached.The first paragraph of the report gives the name of the child, "John
Palmer, age, nine years, and place of residence, South San Francisco,
Culp Hill, near Catholic Orphan Asylum;" and then plunges at once into
_in medias res_.It appears that the period through which the investigation ran was only
fifteen days; but it seems to have been so thorough, by the use of the
ophthalmoscope and other modern appliances and tests, that no regrets
ought to be indulged as to the brevity of the time employed in
experiments.Besides, we have superadded a short and minute account of
our own, verifying some of the most curious facts reported, with several
tests proposed by ourselves and not included in the statement of the
scientific committee.To begin, then, with the beginning of the inquiries by the committee.They were conducted into a small back room, darkened by old blankets
hung up at the window, for the purpose of the total exclusion of
daylight; an absurd remedy for blindness, recommended by a noted quack
whose name adorns the extra fly-leaf of the San Francisco _Truth
Teller_.The lad was reclining upon an old settee, ill-clad and almost
idiotic in expression.As the committee soon ascertained, his mother
only was at home, the father being absent at his customary
occupation--that of switch-tender on the San Jose Railroad.She notified
her son of the presence of strangers and he rose and walked with a firm
step toward where the gentlemen stood, at the entrance of the room.He
shook them all by the hand and bade them good morning.In reply to
questions rapidly put and answered by his mother, the following account
of the infancy of the boy and the accidental discovery of his
extraordinary powers of vision was given:

He was born in the house where the committee found him, nine years ago
the 15th of last January.Nothing of an unusual character occurred until
his second year, when it was announced by a neighbor that the boy was
completely blind, his parents never having been suspicious of the fact
before that time, although the mother declared that for some months
anterior to the discovery she had noticed some acts of the child that
seemed to indicate mental imbecility rather than blindness.From this
time forward until a few months ago nothing happened to vary the boy's
existence except a new remedy now and then prescribed by neighbors for
the supposed malady.He was mostly confined to a darkened chamber, and
was never trusted alone out of doors.He grew familiar, by touch and
sound, with the forms of most objects about him, and could form very
accurate guesses of the color and texture of them all.His
conversational powers did not seem greatly impaired, and he readily
acquired much useful knowledge from listening attentively to everything
that was said in his presence.He was quite a musician, and touched the
harmonicon, banjo and accordeon with skill and feeling.He was unusually
sensitive to the presence of light, though incapable of seeing any
object with any degree of distinctness; and hence the attempt to exclude
light as the greatest enemy to the recovery of vision.It was very
strange that up to the time of the examination of the committee, no
scientific examination of the boy's eye had been made by a competent
oculist, the parents contenting themselves with the chance opinions of
visitors or the cheap nostrums of quacks.It is perhaps fortunate for
science that this was the case, as a cure for the eye might have been an
extinction of its abnormal power.On the evening of the 12th of December last (1875), the position of the
child's bed was temporarily changed to make room for a visitor.The bed
was placed against the wall of the room, fronting directly east, with
the window opening at the side of the bed next to the head.The boy was
sent to bed about seven o'clock, and the parents and their visitor were
seated in the front room, spending the evening in social intercourse.The moon rose full and cloudless about half-past seven o'clock, and
shone full in the face of the sleeping boy.Something aroused him from slumber, and when he opened his eyes the
first object they encountered was the round disk of her orb.By some
oversight the curtain had been removed from the window, and probably for
the first time in his life he beheld the lustrous queen of night
swimming in resplendent radiance, and bathing hill and bay in effulgent
glory.Uttering a cry, equally of terror and delight, he sprang up in
bed and sat there like a statue, with eyes aglare, mouth open, finger
pointed, and astonishment depicted on every feature.His sudden, sharp
scream brought his mother to his side, who tried for some moments in
vain to distract his gaze from the object before him.Failing even to
attract notice, she called in her husband and friend, and together they
besought the boy to lie down and go to sleep, but to no avail.Believing
him to be ill and in convulsions, they soon seized him, and were on the
point of immersing him in a hot bath, when, with a sudden spring, he
escaped from their grasp and ran out the front door.Again he fixed his
unwinking eyes upon the moon, and remained speechless for several
seconds.At length, having seemingly satisfied his present curiosity, he
turned on his mother, who stood wringing her hands in the doorway and
moaning piteously, and exclaimed, "I can see the moon yonder, and it is
so beautiful that I am going there to-morrow morning, as soon as I get
up.""So big," he replied, "that I cannot see it all at one glance--as big as
all out of doors.""How far off from you does it seem to be?""About half a car's distance," he quickly rejoined.It may be here remarked that the boy's idea of distance had been
measured all his life by the distance from his home to the street-car
station at the foot of the hill.This was about two hundred yards, so
that the reply indicated that the moon appeared to be only one hundred
yards from the spectator.The boy then proceeded of his own accord to
give a very minute description of the appearance of objects which he
beheld, corresponding, of course, to his poverty of words with which to
clothe his ideas.His account of things beheld by him was so curious, wonderful and
apparently accurate, that the little group about him passed rapidly from
a conviction of his insanity to a belief no less absurd--that he had
become, in the cant lingo of the day, a seeing, or "clairvoyant" medium.Such was the final conclusion to which his parents had arrived at the
time of the visit of the scientific committee.He had been classed with
that credulous school known to this century as spiritualists, and had
been visited solely by persons of that ilk heretofore.The committee having fully examined the boy, and a number of independent
witnesses, as to the facts, soon set about a scientific investigation of
the true causes of of the phenomenon.The first step, of course, was to
examine the lad's eye with the modern ophthalmoscope, an invention of
Professor Helmholtz, of Heidelberg, a few years ago, by means of which
the depths of this organ can be explored, and the smallest variations
from a healthy or normal condition instantaneously detected.The mode of using the instrument is as follows: The room is made
perfectly dark; a brilliant light is then placed near the head of the
patient, and the rays are reflected by a series of small mirrors into
his eye, as if they came from the eye of the observer; then, by looking
through the central aperture of the instrument, the oculist can examine
the illuminated interior of the eyeball, and perceive every detail of
structure, healthy or morbid, as accurately and clearly as we can see
any part of the exterior of the body.No discomfort arises to the organ
examined, and all its hidden mysteries can be studied and understood as
clearly as those of any other organ of the body.This course was taken with John Palmer, and the true secret of his
mysterious power of vision detected in an instant.On applying the ophthalmoscope, the committee ascertained in a moment
that the boy's eye was abnormally shaped.A natural, perfect eye is
perfectly round.But the eye examined was exceedingly flat, very thin,
with large iris, flat lens, immense petira, and wonderfully dilated
pupil.The effect of the shape was at once apparent.It was utterly
impossible to see any object with distinctness at any distance short of
many thousands of miles.Had the eye been elongated inward, or shaped
like an egg--to as great an extent, the boy would have been effectually
blind, for no combination of lens power could have placed the image of
the object beyond the coat of the retina.In other words, there are two
common imperfections of the human organ of sight; one called _myopia_,
or "near-sightedness;" the _presbyopia_, or "far-sightedness.""The axis being too long," says the report, "in myopic eyes, parallel
rays, such as proceed from distant objects, are brought to a focus at a
point so far in front of the retina, that only confused images are
formed upon it.Such a malformation, constituting an excess of
refractive power, can only be neutralized by concave glasses, which give
such a direction to rays entering the eye as will allow of their being
brought to a focus at a proper point for distant perception.""Presbyopia is the reverse of all this.The antero-posterior axis of
such eyes being too short, owing to the flat plate-like shape of the
ball, their refractive power is not sufficient to bring even parallel
rays to a focus upon the retina, but is adapted for convergent rays
only.Convex glasses, in a great measure, compensate for this quality by
rendering parallel rays convergent; and such glasses, in ordinary cases,
bring the rays to a focus at a convenient distance from the glass,
corresponding to its degree of curvature."But in the case under
examination, no glass or combination of glasses could be invented
sufficiently concave to remedy the malformation.By a mathematical
problem of easy solution, it was computed that the nearest distance from
the unaided eye of the patient at which a distinct image could be formed
upon the retina, was two hundred and forty thousand miles, a fraction
short of the mean distance of the moon from the earth; and hence it
became perfectly clear that the boy could see with minute distinctness
whatever was transpiring on the surface of the moon.Such being the undeniable truth as demonstrated by science, the
declaration of the lad assumed a far higher value than the mere dicta of
spiritualists, or the mad ravings of a monomaniac; and the committee at
once set to work to glean all the astronomical knowledge they could by
frequent and prolonged night interviews with the boy.It was on the night of January 9, 1876, that the first satisfactory
experiment was tried, testing beyond all cavil or doubt the powers of
the subject's eye.It was full moon, and that luminary rose clear and
dazzlingly bright.The committee were on hand at an early hour, and the
boy was in fine condition and exuberant spirits.The interview was
secret, and none but the members of the committee and the parents of the
child were present.Of course the first proposition to be settled was
that of the inhabitability of that sphere.This the boy had frequently
declared was the case, and he had on several previous occasions
described minutely the form, size and means of locomotion of the
Lunarians.On this occasion he repeated in almost the same language,
what he had before related to his parents and friends, but was more
minute, owing to the greater transparency of the atmosphere and the
experience in expression already acquired.The Lunarians are not formed at all like ourselves.They are less in
height, and altogether of a different appearance.When fully grown, they
resemble somewhat a chariot wheel, with four spokes, converging at the
center or axle.They have four eyes in the head, which is the axle, so
to speak, and all the limbs branch out directly from the center, like
some sea-forms known as "Radiates."They move by turning rapidly like a
wheel, and travel as fast as a bird through the air.The children are
undeveloped in form, and are perfectly round, like a pumpkin or orange.As they grow older, they seem to drop or absorb the rotundity of the
whole body, and finally assume the appearance of a chariot wheel.They are of different colors, or nationalities--bright red, orange and
blue being the predominant hues.They
do no work, but sleep every four or five hours.They have no houses, and
need none.They have no clothing, and do not require it.There being no
night on the side of the moon fronting the sun, and no day on the
opposite side, all the inhabitants, apparently at a given signal of some
kind, form into vast armies, and flock in myriads to the sleeping
grounds on the shadow-side of the planet.They do not appear to go very
far over the dark rim, for they reappear in immense platoons in a few
hours, and soon spread themselves over the illuminated surface.They
sleep and wake about six times in one ordinary day of twenty-four hours.Their occupations cannot be discerned; they must be totally different
from anything upon the earth.The surface of the moon is all hill and hollow.There are but few level
spots, nor is there any water visible.The atmosphere is almost as
refined and light as hydrogen gas.There is no fire visible, nor are
there any volcanoes.Most of the time of the inhabitants seems to be
spent in playing games of locomotion, spreading themselves into squares,
circles, triangles, and other mathematical figures.No one or two are ever seen separated from the main bodies.The children also flock in herds, and seem to be all of one family.They seem to spawn like herring or shad, or to
be propagated like bees, from the queen, in myriads.The moment after a mathematical figure is formed, it
is dissolved, and fresh combinations take place, like the atoms in a
kaleidoscope.No other species of animal, bird, or being exist upon the
illuminated face of the moon.The shrubbery and vegetation of the moon is all metallic.Vegetable life
nowhere exists; but the forms of some of the shrubs and trees are
exceedingly beautiful.The highest trees do not exceed twenty-five feet,
and they appear to have all acquired their full growth.The ground is
strewn with flowers, but they are all formed of metals--gold, silver,
copper, and tin predominating.But there is a new kind of metal seen
everywhere on tree, shrub and flower, nowhere known on the earth.It is
of a bright vermilion color, and is semi-transparent.The mountains are
all of bare and burnt granite, and appear to have been melted with fire.The committee called the attention of the boy to the bright "sea of
glass" lately observed near the northern rim of the moon, and inquired
of what it is composed.He examined it carefully, and gave such a minute
description of it that it became apparent at once to the committee that
it was pure mercury or quicksilver.The reason why it has but very
recently shown itself to astronomers is thus accounted for: it appears
close up to the line of demarcation separating the light and shadow upon
the moon's disk; and on closer inspection a distinct cataract of the
fluid--in short, a metallic Niagara, was clearly seen falling from the
night side to the day side of the luminary.It has already filled up a
vast plain--one of the four that exist on the moon's surface--and
appears to be still emptying itself with very great rapidity and volume.It covers an area of five by seven hundred miles in extent, and may
possibly deluge one half the entire surface of the moon.It does not
seem to occasion much apprehension to the inhabitants, as they were soon
skating, so to speak, in platoons and battalions, over and across it.In
fact, it presents the appearance of an immense park, to which the
Lunarians flock, and disport themselves with great gusto upon its
polished face.One of the most beautiful sights yet seen by the lad was
the formation of a new figure, which he drew upon the sand with his
finger.The central heart was of crimson-<DW52> natives; the one to the right
of pale orange, and the left of bright blue.It was ten seconds in
forming, and five seconds in dispersing.The number engaged in the
evolution could not be less than half a million.Thus has been solved one of the great astronomical questions of the
century.The next evening the committee assembled earlier, so as to get a view of
the planet Venus before the moon rose.It was the first time that the
lad's attention had been drawn to any of the planets, and he evinced the
liveliest joy when he first beheld the cloudless disk of that
resplendent world.It may here be stated that his power of vision, in
looking at the fixed stars, was no greater or less than that of an
ordinary eye.They appeared only as points of light, too far removed
into the infinite beyond to afford any information concerning their
properties.But the committee were doomed to a greater disappointment
when they inquired of the boy what he beheld on the surface of Venus.He
replied, "Nothing clearly; all is confused and watery; I see nothing
with distinctness."The solution of the difficulty was easily
apprehended, and at once surmised.The focus of the eye was fixed by
nature at 240,000 miles, and the least distance of Venus from the earth
being 24,293,000 miles, it was, of course, impossible to observe that
planet's surface with distinctness.Still she appeared greatly enlarged,
covering about one hundredth part of the heavens, and blazing with
unimaginable splendor.Experiments upon Jupiter and Mars were equally futile, and the committee
half sorrowfully turned again to the inspection of the moon.The report then proceeds at great length to give full descriptions of
the most noted geographical peculiarities of the lunar surface, and
corrects many errors fallen into by Herschel, Leverrier and Proctor.Professor Secchi informs us that the surface of the moon is much better
known to astronomers than the surface of the earth is to geographers;
for there are two zones on the globe within the Arctic and Antarctic
circles, that we can never examine.But every nook and cranny of the
illuminated face of the moon has been fully delineated, examined and
named, so that no object greater than sixty feet square exists but has
been seen and photographed by means of Lord Rosse's telescope and De la
Ruis' camera and apparatus.As the entire report will be ordered
published at the next weekly meeting of the College, we refrain from
further extracts, but now proceed to narrate the results of our own
interviews with the boy.It was on the evening of the 17th of February, 1876, that we ventured
with rather a misgiving heart to approach Culp Hill, and the humble
residence of a child destined, before the year is out, to become the
most celebrated of living beings.We armed ourselves with a pound of
sugar candy for the boy, some _muslin-de-laine_ as a present to the
mother, and a box of cigars for the father.We also took with us a very
large-sized opera-glass, furnished for the purpose by M. Muller.At
first we encountered a positive refusal; then, on exhibiting the cigars,
a qualified negative; and finally, when the muslin and candy were drawn
on the enemy, we were somewhat coldly invited in and proffered a seat.The boy was pale and restless, and his eyes without bandage or glasses.We soon ingratiated ourself into the good opinion of the whole party,
and henceforth encountered no difficulty in pursuing our investigations.The moon being nearly full, we first of all verified the tests by the
committee.Requesting, then, to stay until after midnight, for the purpose of
inspecting Mars with the opera-glass, we spent the interval in obtaining
the history of the child, which we have given above.The planet Mars being at this time almost in dead opposition to the sun,
and with the earth in conjunction, is of course as near to the earth as
he ever approaches, the distance being thirty-five millions of miles.He
rises toward midnight, and is in the constellation Virgo, where he may
be seen to the greatest possible advantage, being in perigee.Mars is
most like the earth of all the planetary bodies.He revolves on his axis
in a little over twenty-four hours, and his surface is pleasantly
variegated with land and water, pretty much like our own world--the
land, however, being in slight excess.He is, therefore, the most
interesting of all the heavenly bodies to the inhabitants of the earth.Having all things in readiness, we directed the glass to the planet.Alas, for all our calculations, the power was insufficient to clear away
the obscurity resulting from imperfect vision and short focus.Swallowing the bitter disappointment, we hastily made arrangements for
another interview, with a telescope, and bade the family good night.There is but one large telescope properly mounted in the city, and that
is the property and pride of its accomplished owner, J. P. Manrow, Esq.We at once procured an interview with that gentleman, and it was agreed
that on Saturday evening the boy should be conveyed to his residence,
picturesquely situated on Russian Hill, commanding a magnificent view of
the Golden Gate and the ocean beyond.At the appointed hour the boy, his parents and myself presented
ourselves at the door of that hospitable mansion.We were cordially
welcomed, and conducted without further parley into the lofty
observatory on the top of the house.In due time the magnificent tube
was presented at the planet, but it was discovered that the power it was
set for was too low.It was then gauged for 240,000 diameters, being the
full strength of the telescope, and the eye of the boy observer placed
at the eye-glass.One cry of joy, and unalloyed delight told the story!Mars, and its mountains and seas, its rivers, vales, and estuaries, its
polar snow-caps and grassy plains--its inhabitants, palaces, ships,
villages and cities, were all revealed, as distinctly, clearly and
certainly, as the eye of Kit Carson, from the summits of the Sierra
Nevada range, beheld the stupendous panorama of the Sacramento Valley,
and the snow-clad summits of Mount Hood and Shasta Butte.[Decoration]

XII._THE EMERALD ISLE._


    Chaos was ended.From its ruins rolled
    The central Sun, poised on his throne of gold;
    The changeful Moon, that floods the hollow dome
    Of raven midnight with her silvery foam;
    Vast constellations swarming all around,
    In seas of azure, without line or bound,
    And this green globe, rock-ribbed and mountain-crown'd.The eye of God, before His hand had made
    Man in His image, this wide realm surveyed;
    O'er hill and valley, over stream and wood,
    He glanced triumphant, and pronounced it "good."But ere He formed old Adam and his bride,
    He called a shining seraph to His side,
    And pointing to our world, that gleamed afar,
    And twinkled on creation's verge, a star,
    Bade him float 'round this new and narrow span
    And bring report if all were ripe for Man.The angel spread his fluttering pinions fair,
    And circled thrice the circumambient air;
    Quick, then, as thought, he stood before the gate
    Where cherubs burn, and minist'ring spirits wait.Nor long he stood, for God beheld his plume,
    Already tarnished by terrestrial gloom,
    And beck'ning kindly to the flurried aid,
    Said, "Speak your wish; if good, be it obeyed."The seraph raised his gem-encircled hand,
    Obeisance made, at heaven's august command,
    And thus replied, in tones so bold and clear,
    That angels turned and lent a listening ear:
    "Lord of all systems, be they near or far,
    Thrice have I circled 'round yon beauteous Star,
    I've seen its mountains rise, its rivers roll,
    Its oceans sweep majestic to each pole;
    Its floors in mighty continents expand,
    Or dwindle into specs of fairy-land;
    Its prairies spread, its forests stretch in pride,
    And all its valleys dazzle like a bride;
    Hymns have I heard in all its winds and streams,
    And beauty seen in all its rainbow gleams.But whilst the LAND can boast of every gem
    That sparkles in each seraph's diadem;
    Whilst diamonds blaze 'neath dusk Golconda's skies,
    And rubies bleed where Alps and Andes rise;
    Whilst in Brazilian brooks the topaz shines,
    And opals burn in California mines;
    Whilst in the vales of Araby the Blest
    The sapphire flames beside the amethyst:
    The pauper Ocean sobs forever more,
    Ungemm'd, unjeweled, on its wailing shore!""Add music to the song the breakers sing!"The strong-soul'd seraph cried, "I'd make yon sea
    Rival in tone heaven's sweetest minstrelsy;
    I'd plant within the ocean's bubbling tide
    An island gem, of every sea the pride!So bright in robes of ever-living green,
    In breath so sweet, in features so serene,
    Such crystal streams to course its valleys fair,
    Such healthful gales to purify its air,
    Such fertile soil, such ever-verdant trees,
    Angels should name it 'EMERALD OF THE SEAS!'"The seraph paused, and downward cast his eyes,
    Whilst heav'nly hosts stood throbbing with surprise.Again the Lord of all the realms above,
    Supreme in might, but infinite in love,
    With no harsh accent in His tones replied:
    "Go, drop this Emerald in the envious tide!"Quick as the lightning cleaves the concave blue,
    The seraph seized the proffer'd gem, and flew
    Until he reached the confines of the earth,
    Still struggling in the throes of turbid birth;
    And there, upon his self-sustaining wing,
    Sat poised, and heard our globe her matins sing;
    Beheld the sun traverse the arching sky,
    The sister Moon walk forth in majesty;
    Saw every constellation rise and roll
    Athwart the heaven, or circle round the pole.Nor did he move, until our spotted globe
    Had donned for him her morn and evening robe;
    Till on each land his critic eye was cast,
    And every ocean rose, and heav'd, and pass'd;
    Then, like some eagle pouncing on its prey,
    He downward sail'd, through bellowing clouds and spray,
    To where he saw the billows bounding free,
    And dropped the gem within the stormy sea!And would'st thou know, Chief of St.Patrick's band,
    Where fell this jewel from the seraph's hand?What ocean caught the world-enriching prize?Child of Moina, homeward cast your eyes!in the midst of wat'ry deserts wide,
    Behold the EMERALD bursting through the tide,
    And bearing on its ever vernal-sod
    The monogram of seraph, and of God!Its name, the sweetest human lips e'er sung,
    First trembled on an angel's fervid tongue;
    Then chimed AEolian on the evening air,
    Lisped by an infant, in its mother prayer;
    Next roared in war, with battle's flag unfurl'd;
    Now, gemm'd with glory, gather'd through the world!Perfidious Albion, blush with shame:
    It is thy sister's!Once more the seraph stood before the throne
    Of dread Omnipotence, pensive and alone."I dropped the jewel in the flashing tide,"
    The seraph said; but saw with vision keen
    A mightier angel stalk upon the scene,
    Whose voice like grating thunder smote his ear
    And taught his soul the mystery of fear."Because thy heart with impious pride did swell,
    And dared make better what thy God made well;
    Because thy hand did fling profanely down
    On Earth a jewel wrenched from Heaven's bright crown,
    The Isle which thine own fingers did create
    Shall reap a blessing and a curse from fate!"Far in the future, as the years roll on,
    And all the pagan ages shall have flown;
    When Christian virtues, flaming into light,
    Shall save the world from superstition's night;
    Erin, oppress'd, shall bite the tyrant's heel,
    And for a thousand years enslaved shall kneel;
    Her sons shall perish in the field and flood,
    Her daughters starve in city, wold, and wood;
    Her patriots, with their blood, the block shall stain,
    Her matrons fly behind the Western main;
    Harpies from Albion shall her strength consume,
    And thorns and thistles in her gardens bloom.But, curse of curses thine, O!fated land:
    Traitors shall thrive where statesmen ought to stand!But past her heritage of woe and pain,
    A far more blest millennium shall reign;
    Seedlings of heroes shall her exiles be,
    Where'er they find a home beyond the sea;
    Bright paragons of beauty and of truth,
    Her maidens all shall dazzle in their youth;
    And when age comes, to dim the flashing eye,
    Still gems of virtue shall they live, and die!No braver race shall breathe beneath the sun
    Than thine, O!Erin, ere the goal be won.Wherever man shall battle for the right,
    There shall thy sons fall thickest in the fight;
    Wherever man shall perish to be free,
    There shall thy martyrs foremost be!when thy redemption is at hand,
    Soldiers shall swell thy ranks from every land!Heroes shall flock in thousands to thy shore,
    And swear thy soil is FREE FOREVERMORE!Then shall thy harp be from the willow torn,
    And in yon glitt'ring galaxy be borne!Then shall the Emerald change its verdant crest,
    And blaze a Star co-equal with the rest!The sentence pass'd, the doomsman felt surprise,
    For tears were streaming from the seraph's eyes."Weep not for Erin," once again he spoke,
    "But for thyself, that did'st her doom provoke;
    I bear a message, seraph, unto thee,
    As unrelenting in its stern decree.For endless years it is thy fate to stand,
    The chosen guardian of the SHAMROCK land.Three times, as ages wind their coils away,
    Incarnate on yon Island shalt thou stray."First as a Saint, in majesty divine,
    The world shall know thee by this potent sign:
    From yonder soil, where pois'nous reptiles dwell,
    Thy voice shall snake and slimy toad expel.Next as a Martyr, pleading in her cause,
    Thy blood shall flow to build up Albion's laws.Last as a Prophet and a Bard combined,
    Rebellion's fires shall mould thy patriot mind.In that great day, when Briton's strength shall fail,
    And all her glories shiver on the gale;
    When winged chariots, rushing through the sky,
    Shall drop their <DW19>s, blazing as they fly,
    Thy form shall tower, a hero'midst the flames,
    And add one more to Erin's deathless names!"gathered here in state,
    Such is the story of your country's fate.Six thousand years in strife have rolled away,
    Since Erin sprang from billowy surf and spray;
    In that drear lapse, her sons have never known
    One ray of peace to gild her crimson zone.Cast back your glance athwart the tide of years,
    Behold each billow steeped with Erin's tears,
    Inspect each drop that swells the mighty flood,
    Its purple globules smoke with human blood!Come with me now, and trace the seraph's path,
    That has been trodden since his day of wrath.in the year when Attila the Hun
    Had half the world in terror overrun,
    On Erin's shore there stood a noble youth,
    The breath of honor and the torch of truth.His was the tongue that taught the Celtic soul
    Christ was its Saviour, Heaven was its goal!His was the hand that drove subdued away,
    The venom horde that lured but to betray;
    His were the feet that sanctified the sod,
    Erin redeemed, and gave her back to God!The gray old Earth can boost no purer fame
    Than that whose halos gild ST.Twelve times the centuries builded up their store
    Of plots, rebellions, gibbets, tears and gore;
    Twelve times centennial annivers'ries came,
    To bless the seraph in St.In that long night of treach'ry and gloom,
    How many myriads found a martyr's tomb!Beside the waters of the dashing Rhone
    In exile starved the bold and blind TYRONE.Beneath the glamour of the tyrant's steel
    Went out in gloom the soul of great O'NEILL.What countless thousands, children of her loin,
    Sank unanneal'd beneath the bitter Boyne!What fathers fell, what mothers sued in vain,
    In Tredah's walls, on Wexford's gory plain,
    When Cromwell's shaven panders slaked their lust,
    And Ireton's fiends despoiled the breathless dust!Still came no seraph, incarnate in man,
    To rescue Erin from the bandit clan.Still sad and lone, she languished in her chains,
    That clank'd in chorus o'er her martyrs' manes.At length, when Freedom's struggle was begun
    Across the seas, by conq'ring Washington,
    When CURRAN thunder'd, and when GRATTAN spoke,
    The guardian seraph from his slumber woke.Then guilty Norbury from his vengeance fled,
    FITZGERALD fought, and glorious WOLFE TONE bled.Then EMMET rose, to start the battle-cry,
    To strike, to plead, to threaten, and to die!happier in thy doom,
    Though uninscrib'd remains thy seraph tomb,
    Than the long line of Erin's scepter'd foes,
    Whose bones in proud mausoleums repose;
    More noble blood through Emmet's pulses rings
    Than courses through ten thousand hearts of kings!Thus has the seraph twice redeem'd his fate,
    And roamed a mortal through this low estate;
    Again obedient to divine command,
    His final incarnation is at hand.Scarce shall yon sun _five times_ renew the year,
    Ere Erin's guardian Angel shall appear,
    Not as a priest, in holy garb arrayed;
    Not as a patriot, by his cause betray'd,
    Shall he again assume a mortal guise,
    And tread the earth, an exile from the skies.But like the lightning from the welkin hurl'd,
    His eye shall light, his step shall shake the world!Are ye but scions of degenerate slaves?Shall tyrants spit upon your fathers' graves?Is all the life-blood stagnant in your veins?Love ye no music but the clank of chains?Hear ye no voices ringing in the air,
    That chant in chorus wild, _Prepare_, PREPARE!on the winds there comes a prophet sound,--
    The blood of Abel crying from the ground,--
    Pealing in tones of thunder through the world,
    "ARM!On some bold headland do I seem to stand,
    And watch the billows breaking 'gainst the land;
    Not in lone rollers do their waters poor,
    But the vast ocean rushes to the shore.So flock in millions sons of honest toil,
    From ev'ry country, to their native soil;
    Exiles of Erin, driven from her sod,
    By foes of justice, mercy, man, and God!AErial chariots spread their snowy wings,
    And drop torpedoes in the halls of kings.On every breeze a thousand banners fly,
    And Erin's seraph swells the battle-cry:--
    "Strike!till proud Albion bows her haughty head!for the bones that fill your mothers' graves!till fair Freedom on the world shall smile![Decoration]

XIII._THE EARTH'S HOT CENTER._


The following extracts from the report of the Hon.John Flannagan,
United States Consul at Bruges, in Belgium, to the Secretary of State,
published in the Washington City _Telegraph_ of a late date, will fully
explain what is meant by the "Great Scare in Belgium."Our extracts are not taken continuously, as the entire document would be
too voluminous for our pages.But where breaks appear we have indicated
the hiatus in the usual manner by asterisks, or by brief explanations.BRUGES, December 12, 1872.HAMILTON FISH,
                     Secretary of State.SIR: In pursuance of special instructions recently received from
   Washington (containing inclosures from Prof.Henry of the
   Smithsonian Institute, and Prof.Lovering of Harvard), I
   proceeded on Wednesday last to the scene of operations at the
   "International Exploring Works," and beg leave to submit the
   following circumstantial report:

   Before proceeding to detail the actual state of affairs at
   Dudzeele, near the line of canal connecting Bruges with the North
   Sea, it may not be out of place to furnish a succinct history of
   the origin of the explorations out of which the present alarming
   events have arisen.It will be remembered by the State Department
   that during the short interregnum of the provisional government
   of France, under Lamartine and Cavaignac, in 1848, a proposition
   was submitted by France to the governments of the United States,
   Great Britain and Russia, and which was subsequently extended to
   King Leopold of Belgium, to create an "International Board for
   Subterranean Exploration" in furtherance of science, and in
   order, primarily, to test the truth of the theory of igneous
   central fusion, first propounded by Leibnitz, and afterward
   embraced by most of contemporary geologists; but also with the
   further objects of ascertaining the magnetic condition of the
   earth's crust, the variations of the needle at great depths, and
   finally to set at rest the doubts of some of the English
   mineralogists concerning the permanency of the coal measures,
   about which considerable alarm had been felt in all the
   manufacturing centers of Europe.The protocol of a quintuple treaty was finally drawn by Prof.Henry, of the Smithsonian Institute, and approved by Sir Roderick
   Murchison, at that time President of the Royal Society of Great
   Britain.To this project Arago lent the weight of his great name,
   and Nesselrode affixed the approval of Russia, it being one of
   the last official acts performed by that veteran statesman.The programme called for annual appropriations by each of the
   above-named powers of 100,000 francs (about $20,000 each), the
   appointment of commissioners and a general superintendent, the
   selection of a site for prosecuting the undertaking, and a board
   of scientific visitors, consisting of one member from each
   country.It is unnecessary to detail the proceedings for the first few
   months after the organization of the commission.Watson, of
   Chicago, the author of a scientific treatise called "Prairie
   Geology," was selected by President Fillmore, as the first
   representative of the United States; Russia sent Olgokoff;
   France, Ango Jeuno; England, Sir Edward Sabine, the present
   President of the Royal Society; and Belgium, Dr.Secchi, since so
   famous for his spectroscopic observations on the fixed stars.These gentlemen, after organizing at Paris, spent almost an
   entire year in traveling before a site for the scene of
   operations was selected.Finally, on the 10th of April, 1849, the
   first ground was broken for actual work at Dudzeele, in the
   neighborhood of Bruges, in the Kingdom of Belgium.The considerations which led to the choice of this locality were
   the following: First, it was the most central, regarding the
   capitals of the parties to the protocol; secondly, it was easy of
   access and connected by rail with Brussels, Paris and St.Petersburg, and by line of steamers with London, being situated
   within a short distance of the mouth of the Hond or west Scheldt;
   thirdly, and perhaps as the most important consideration of all,
   it was the seat of the deepest shaft in the world, namely, the
   old salt mine at Dudzeele, which had been worked from the time of
   the Romans down to the commencement of the present century, at
   which time it was abandoned, principally on account of the
   intense heat at the bottom of the excavation, and which could not
   be entirely overcome except by the most costly scientific
   appliances.There was still another reason, which, in the estimation of at
   least one member of the commission, Prof.Watson, overrode them
   all--the exceptional increase of heat with depth, which was its
   main characteristic.The scientific facts upon which this great work was projected,
   may be stated as follows: It is the opinion of the principal
   modern geologists, based primarily upon the hypothesis of Kant
   (that the solar universe was originally an immense mass of
   incandescent vapor gradually cooled and hardened after being
   thrown off from the grand central body--afterward elaborated by
   La Place into the present nebular hypothesis)--that "the globe
   was once in a state of igneous fusion, and that as its heated
   mass began to cool, an exterior crust was formed, first very
   thin, and afterward gradually increasing until it attained its
   present thickness, which has been variously estimated at from ten
   to two hundred miles.During the process of gradual
   refrigeration, some portions of the crust cooled more rapidly
   than others, and the pressure on the interior igneous mass being
   unequal, the heated matter or lava burst through the thinner
   parts, and caused high-peaked mountains; the same cause also
   producing all volcanic action."The arguments in favor of this
   doctrine are almost innumerable; these are among the most
   prominent:

   _First._ The form of the earth is just that which an igneous
   liquid mass would assume if thrown into an orbit with an axial
   revolution similar to that of our earth.Not many years ago
   Professor Faraday, assisted by Wheatstone, devised a most
   ingenious apparatus by which, in the laboratory of the Royal
   Society, he actually was enabled, by injecting a flame into a
   vacuum, to exhibit visibly all the phenomena of the formation of
   the solar universe, as contended for by La Place and by Humboldt
   in his "Cosmos."_Secondly._ It is perfectly well ascertained that heat increases
   with depth, in all subterranean excavations.This is the
   invariable rule in mining shafts, and preventive measures must
   always be devised and used, by means generally of air apparatus,
   to temper the heat as the depth is augmented, else deep mining
   would have to be abandoned.The rate of increase has been
   variously estimated by different scientists in widely distant
   portions of the globe.A few of them may be mentioned at this
   place, since it was upon a total miscalculation on this head that
   led to the present most deplorable results.The editor of the _Journal of Science_, in April, 1832,
   calculated from results obtained in six of the deepest coal mines
   in Durham and Northumberland, the mean rate of increase at one
   degree of Fahrenheit for a descent of forty-four English feet.In this instance it is noticeable that the bulb of the
   thermometer was introduced into cavities purposely cut into the
   solid rock, at depths varying from two hundred to nine hundred
   feet.The Dolcoath mine in Cornwall, as examined by Mr.Fox, at
   the depth of thirteen hundred and eighty feet, gave on average
   result of four degrees for every seventy-five feet.Kupffer compared results obtained from the silver mines in
   Mexico, Peru and Freiburg, from the salt wells of Saxony, and
   from the copper mines in the Caucasus, together with an
   examination of the tin mines of Cornwall and the coal mines in
   the north of England, and found the average to be at least one
   degree of Fahrenheit for every thirty-seven English feet.Cordier, on the contrary, considers this amount somewhat
   overstated and reduces the general average to one degree
   Centigrade for every twenty-five metres, or about one degree of
   Fahrenheit for every forty-five feet English measure._Thirdly._ That the lavas taken from all parts of the world, when
   subjected to chemical analysis, indicate that they all proceed
   from a common source; and

   _Fourthly._ On no other hypothesis can we account for the change
   of climate indicated by fossils.The rate of increase of heat in the Dudzeele shaft was no less
   than one degree Fahrenheit for every thirty feet English measure.At the time of recommencing sinking in the shaft on the 10th of
   April, 1849, the perpendicular depth was twenty-three hundred and
   seventy feet, the thermometer marking forty-eight degrees
   Fahrenheit at the surface; this would give the enormous heat of
   one hundred and twenty-seven degrees Fahrenheit at the bottom of
   the mine.Of course, without ventilation no human being could
   long survive in such an atmosphere, and the first operations of
   the commission were directed to remedy this inconvenience.The report then proceeds to give the details of a very successful
contrivance for forcing air into the shaft at the greatest depths, only
a portion of which do we deem it important to quote, as follows:

   The width of the Moer-Vater, or Lieve, at this point, was ten
   hundred and eighty yards, and spanned by an old bridge, the stone
   piers of which were very near together, having been built by the
   emperor Hadrian in the early part of the second century.The rise
   of the tide in the North Sea, close at hand, was from fifteen to
   eighteen feet, thus producing a current almost as rapid as that
   of the Mersey at Liverpool.The commissioners determined to
   utilize this force, in preference to the erection of expensive
   steam works at the mouth of the mine.A plan was submitted by
   Cyrus W. Field, and at once adopted.Turbine wheels were built,
   covering the space betwixt each arch, movable, and adapted to the
   rise and fall of the tide.Gates were also constructed between
   each arch, and a head of water, ranging from ten to fifteen feet
   fall, provided for each turn of the tide--both in the ebb and the
   flow, so that there should be a continuous motion to the
   machinery.Near the mouth of the shaft two large boiler-iron
   reservoirs were constructed, capable of holding from one hundred
   and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand cubic feet of
   compressed air, the average rate of condensation being about two
   hundred atmospheres.These reservoirs were properly connected
   with the pumping apparatus of the bridge by large cast-iron
   mains, so that the supply was continuous, and at an almost
   nominal cost.It was by the same power of compressed air that the
   tunneling through Mount St.Gothard was effected for the Lyons
   and Turin Railway, just completed.The first operations were to enlarge the shaft so as to form an
   opening forty by one hundred feet, English measure.This consumed
   the greater part of the year 1849, so that the real work of
   sinking was not fairly under way until early in 1850.But from
   that period down to the memorable 5th of November, 1872, the
   excavation steadily progressed.I neglected to state at the
   outset that M. Jean Dusoloy, the state engineer of Belgium, was
   appointed General Superintendent, and continued to fill that
   important office until he lost his life, on the morning of the
   6th of November, the melancholly details of which are hereinafter
   fully narrated.As the deepening progressed the heat of the bottom continued to
   increase, but it was soon observed in a different ratio from the
   calculations of the experts.After attaining the depth of fifteen
   thousand six hundred and fifty feet,--about the height of Mt.Blanc--which was reached early in 1864, it was noticed, for the
   first time, that the laws of temperature and gravitation were
   synchronous; that is, that the heat augmented in a ratio
   proportioned to the square of the distance from the surface
   downward.Hence the increase at great depths bore no relation at
   all to the apparently gradual augmentation near the surface.As
   early as June, 1868, it became apparent that the sinking, if
   carried on at all, would have to be protected by some
   atheromatous or adiathermic covering.Professor Tyndall was
   applied to, and, at the request of Lord Palmerston, made a vast
   number of experiments on non-conducting bodies.As the result of
   his labors, he prepared a compound solution about the density of
   common white lead, composed of selenite alum and sulphate of
   copper, which was laid on three or four thicknesses, first upon
   the bodies of the naked miners--for in all deep mines the
   operatives work _in puris naturalibus_--and then upon an
   oval-shaped cage made of papier mache, with a false bottom,
   enclosed within which the miners were enabled to endure the
   intense heat for a shift of two hours each day.The drilling was
   all done by means of the diamond-pointed instrument, and the
   blasting by nitro-glycerine from the outset; so that the
   principal labor consisted in shoveling up the debris and keeping
   the drill-point _in situ_.Before proceeding further it may not be improper to enumerate a
   few of the more important scientific facts which, up to the 1st
   of November of the past year, had been satisfactorily
   established.First in importance is the one alluded to above--the
   rate of increase of temperature as we descend into the bowels of
   the earth.This law, shown above to correspond exactly with the
   law of attraction or gravitation, had been entirely overlooked by
   all the scientists, living or dead.No one had for a moment
   suspected that heat followed the universal law of physics as a
   material body ought to do, simply because, from the time of De
   Saussure, heat had been regarded only as a force or _vis viva_
   and not as a ponderable quality.But not only was heat found to be subject to the law of inverse
   ratio of the square of the distance from the surface, but the
   atmosphere itself followed the same invariable rule.Thus, while
   we know that water boils at the level of the sea at two hundred
   and twelve degrees Fahrenheit, it readily vaporizes at one
   hundred and eighty-five degrees on the peak of Teneriffe, only
   fifteen thousand feet above that level.This, we know, is owing
   to the weight of the superincumbent atmosphere, there being a
   heavier burden at the surface than at any height above it.The
   rate of decrease above the surface is perfectly regular, being
   one degree for every five hundred and ninety feet of ascent.But
   the amazing fact was shown that the weight of the atmosphere
   increased in a ratio proportioned to the square of the distance
   downward.... The magnetic needle also evinced some curious
   disturbance, the dip being invariably upward.Its action also was
   exceedingly feeble, and the day before the operations ceased it
   lost all polarity whatever, and the finest magnet would not
   meander from the point of the compass it happened to be left at
   for the time being.As Sir Edward Sabine finely said, "The hands
   of the magnetic clock stopped."But the activity of the needle
   gradually increased as the surface was approached.All electrical action also ceased, which fully confirms the
   theory, of Professor Faraday, that "electricity is a force
   generated by the rapid axial revolution of the earth, and that
   magnetic attraction in all cases points or operates at right
   angles to its current."Hence electricity, from the nature of its
   cause, must be superficial.Every appearance of water disappeared at the depth of only 9000
   feet.From this depth downward the rock was of a basaltic
   character, having not the slightest appearance of granite
   formation--confirming, in a most remarkable manner, the discovery
   made only last year, that all _granites_ are of _aqueous_,
   instead of _igneous_ deposition.As a corollary from the law of
   atmospheric pressure, it was found utterly impossible to vaporize
   water at a greater depth than 24,000 feet, which point was
   reached in 1869.No amount of heat affected it in the least
   perceptible manner, and on weighing the liquid at the greatest
   depth attained, by means of a nicely adjusted scale, it was found
   to be of a density expressed thus: 198,073, being two degrees or
   integers of atomic weight heavier than gold, at the surface.The report then proceeds to discuss the question of the true figure of
the earth, whether an oblate spheroid, as generally supposed, or only
truncated at the poles; the length of a degree of longitude at the
latitude of Dudzeele, 51 deg.The concluding portion of the report is reproduced in full.For the past twelve months it was found impossible to endure the
   heat, even sheltered as the miners were by the atmospheric cover
   and cage, for more than fifteen minutes at a time, so that the
   expense of sinking had increased geometrically for the past two
   years.However, important results had been obtained, and a
   perpendicular depth reached many thousands of feet below the
   deepest sea soundings of Lieutenant Brooks.In fact, the enormous
   excavation, on the 1st of November, 1872, measured
   perpendicularly, no less than 37,810 feet and 6 inches from the
   floor of the shaft building!The highest peak of the Himalayas is
   only little over 28,000 feet, so that it can at once be seen that
   no time had been thrown away by the Commissioners since the
   inception of the undertaking, in April, 1849.The first symptoms of alarm were felt on the evening of November
   1.The men complained of a vast increase of heat, and the cages
   had to be dropped every five minutes for the greater part of the
   night; and of those who attempted to work, at least one half were
   extricated in a condition of fainting, but one degree from
   cyncope.Toward morning, hoarse, profound and frequent
   subterranean explosions were heard, which had increased at noon
   to one dull, threatening and continuous roar.But the miners went
   down bravely to their tasks, and resolved to work as long as
   human endurance could bear it.But this was not to be much
   longer; for late at night, on the 4th, after hearing a terrible
   explosion, which shook the whole neighborhood, a hot sirocco
   issued from the bottom, which drove them all out in a state of
   asphyxia.The heat at the surface became absolutely unendurable,
   and on sending down a cage with only a dog in it, the materials
   of which it was composed took fire, and the animal perished in
   the flames.At 3 o'clock A. M. the iron fastenings to another
   cage were found fused, and the wire ropes were melted for more
   than 1000 feet at the other end.The detonations became more
   frequent, the trembling of the earth at the surface more violent,
   and the heat more oppressive around the mouth of the orifice.A
   few minutes before 4 o'clock a subterranean crash was heard,
   louder than Alpine thunder, and immediately afterward a furious
   cloud of ashes, smoke and gaseous exhalation shot high up into
   the still darkened atmosphere of night.At this time at least one
   thousand of the terrified and half-naked inhabitants of the
   neighboring village of Dudzeele had collected on the spot, and
   with wringing hands and fearful outcries bewailed their fate, and
   threatened instant death to the officers of the commission, and
   even to the now terrified miners.Finally, just before dawn, on
   the 5th of November, or, to be more precise, at exactly twenty
   minutes past 6 A. M., molten lava made its appearance at the
   surface!The fright now became general, and as the burning buildings shed
   their ominous glare around, and the languid stream of liquid fire
   slowly bubbled up and rolled toward the canal, the scene assumed
   an aspect of awful sublimity and grandeur.The plains around were
   lit up for many leagues, and the foggy skies intensified and
   reduplicated the effects of the illumination.Toward sunrise the
   flow of lava was suspended for nearly an hour, but shortly after
   ten o'clock it suddenly increased its volume, and, as it cooled,
   formed a sort of saucer-shaped funnel, over the edges of which it
   boiled up, broke, and ran off in every direction.It was at this
   period that the accomplished Dusoloy, so long the Superintendent,
   lost his life.As the lava slowly meandered along, he attempted
   to cross the stream by stepping from one mass of surface cinders
   to another.Making a false step, the floating rock upon which he
   sprang suddenly turned over, and before relief could be afforded
   his body was consumed to a crisp.I regret to add that his fate
   kindled no sympathy among the assembled multitude; but they
   rudely seized his mutilated remains, and amid jeers, execrations,
   and shouts of triumph, attached a large stone to the
   half-consumed corpse and precipitated it into the canal.Thus are
   the heroes of science frequently sacrificed to the fury of a
   plebeian mob.It would afford me a pleasure to inform the department that the
   unforeseen evils of our scientific convention terminated here.But I regret to add that such is very far from being the case.Indeed, from the appearance of affairs this morning at the
   volcanic crater--for such it has now become--the possible evils
   are almost incalculable.The Belgian Government was duly notified
   by telegraph of the death of the Superintendent and the mutinous
   disposition of the common people about Bruges, and early on the
   morning of the 6th of November a squad of flying horse was
   dispatched to the spot to maintain order.But this interference
   only made matters worse.The discontent, augmented by the wildest
   panic, became universal, and the mob reigned supreme.Nor could
   the poor wretches be greatly condemned; for toward evening the
   lava current reached the confines of the old village of Dudzeele,
   and about midnight set the town on fire.The lurid glare of the
   conflagration awakened the old burghers of Bruges from their
   slumbers and spread consternation in the city, though distant
   several miles from the spot.A meeting was called at the
   Guildhall at dawn, and the wildest excitement prevailed.But
   after hearing explanations from the members of the commission,
   the populace quietly but doggedly dispersed.The government from
   this time forward did all that power and prudence combined could
   effect to quell the reign of terror around Bruges.In this
   country the telegraph, being a government monopoly, has been
   rigorously watched and a cordon of military posts established
   around the threatened district, so that it has been almost
   impossible to convey intelligence of this disaster beyond the
   limits of the danger.In the mean time, a congress of the most
   experienced scientists was invited to the scene for the purpose
   of suggesting some remedy against the prospective spread of the
   devastation.The first meeting took place at the old Guildhall in
   Bruges and was strictly private, none being admitted except the
   diplomatic representatives of foreign governments, and the
   members elect of the college.As in duty bound, I felt called on
   to attend, and shall in this place attempt a short synopsis of
   the proceedings.Professor Palmieri, of Naples, presided, and Dr.Kirchoff
   officiated as secretary.Gassiot, of Paris, was the first speaker, and contended that the
   theory of nucleatic fusion, now being fully established it only
   remained to prescribe the laws governing its superficial action."There is but one law applicable, that I am aware of," said he,
   "and that is the law which drives from the center of a revolving
   body all fluid matter toward the circumference, and forcibly
   ejects it into space, if possible, in the same manner that a
   common grindstone in rapid motion will drive off from its rim
   drops of water or other foreign unattached matter.Thus, whenever
   we find a vent or open orifice, as in the craters of active
   volcanoes, the incandescent lava boils up and frequently
   overflows the top of the highest peak of the Andes."Palmieri then asked the speaker "if he wished to be understood as
   expressing the unqualified opinion that an orifice once being
   opened would continue to flow forever, and that there was no law
   governing the quantity or regulating the level to which it could
   rise?"The Neapolitan philosopher then added: "I dissent _in toto_ from
   the opinion of M. Gassiot.For more than a quarter of a century I
   have studied the lava-flows of Vesuvius, AEtna and Stromboli, and
   I can assure the Congress that the Creator has left no such flaw
   in His mechanism of the globe.The truth is, that molten lava can
   only rise about 21,000 feet above the level of the sea, owing to
   the balance-wheel of terrestrial gravitation, which counteracts
   at that height all centrifugal energy.Were this not so, the
   entire contents of the globe would gush from the incandescent
   center and fly off into surrounding space."M. Gassiot replied, "that true volcanoes were supplied by nature
   with _circumvalvular lips_, and hence, after filling their
   craters, they ceased to flow.But in the instance before us no
   such provision existed, and the only protection which he could
   conceive of consisted in the smallness of the orifice; and he
   would therefore recommend his Majesty King Leopold to direct all
   his efforts to confine the aperture to its present size."Palmieri again responded, "that he had no doubt but that the
   crater at Dudzeele would continue to flow until it had built up
   around itself basaltic walls to the height of many hundreds,
   perhaps thousands, of feet, and that the idea of setting bounds
   to the size of the mouth of the excavation was simply
   ridiculous."Gassiot interrupted, and was about to answer in a very excited
   tone, when Prof.Palmieri "disclaimed any intention of personal
   insult, but spoke from a scientific standpoint."He then
   proceeded: "The lava bed of Mount AEtna maintains a normal level
   of 7000 feet, while Vesuvius calmly reposes at a little more than
   one half that altitude.Whitney, of the Pacific Survey, Mount Kilauea, in the Sandwich
   Islands, bubbles up to the enormous height of 17,000 feet.It
   cannot be contended that the crater of Vesuvius is not a true
   nucleatic orifice, because I have demonstrated that the molten
   bed regularly rises and falls like the tides of the ocean when
   controlled by the moon."It was seen at once that the scientists
   present were totally unprepared to discuss the question in its
   novel and most important aspects; and on taking a vote, at the
   close of the session, the members were equally divided between
   the opinions of Gassiot and Palmieri.A further session will take
   place on the arrival of Prof.Tyndall, who has been telegraphed
   for from New York, and of the great Russian geologist and
   astronomer, Tugenieff.In conclusion, the damage already done may be summed up as
   follows: The destruction of the Bruges and Hond Canal by the
   formation of a basaltic <DW18> across it more than two hundred feet
   wide, the burning of Dudzeele, and the devastation of about
   thirty thousand acres of valuable land.At the same time it is
   utterly impossible to predict where the damage may stop, inasmuch
   as early this morning the mouth of the crater had fallen in, and
   the flowing stream had more than doubled in size.In consideration of the part hitherto taken by the Government of
   the United States in originating the work that led to the
   catastrophe, and by request of M. Musenheim, the Belgian Foreign
   Secretary, I have taken the liberty of drawing upon the State
   Department for eighty-seven thousand dollars, being the sum
   agreed to be paid for the cost of emigration to the United States
   of two hundred families (our own pro rata) rendered homeless by
   the conflagration of Dudzeele.I am this moment in receipt of your telegram dated yesterday,
   and rejoice to learn that Prof.Agassiz has returned from the
   South Seas, and will be sent forward without delay.With great respect, I have the honor to be your obedient servant,

                                        JOHN FLANNAGAN,
                                United States Consul at Bruges.P.S.--Since concluding the above dispatch, Professor Palmieri did
   me the honor of a special call, and, after some desultory
   conversation, approached the all-absorbing topic of the day, and
   cautiously expressed his opinion as follows: Explaining his
   theory, as announced at the Congress, he said that "Holland,
   Belgium, and Denmark, being all low countries, some portions of
   each lying below the sea-level, he would not be surprised if the
   present outflow of lava devastated them all, and covered the
   bottom of the North Sea for many square leagues with a bed of
   basalt."The reason given was this: "That lava must continue to
   flow until, by its own action, it builds up around the volcanic
   crater a rim or cone high enough to afford a counterpoise to the
   centrifugal tendency of axial energy; and that, as the earth's
   crust was demonstrated to be exceptionally thin in the north of
   Europe, the height required in this instance would be so great
   that an enormous lapse of time must ensue before the self-created
   cone could obtain the necessary altitude.Before _AEtna_ attained
   its present secure height, it devastated an area as large as
   France; and Prof.Whitney has demonstrated that some center of
   volcanic action, now extinct, in the State of California, threw
   out a stream that covered a much greater surface, as the basaltic
   table mountains, vulgarly so called, extend north and south for a
   distance as great as from Moscow to Rome."In concluding his
   remarks, he ventured the prediction that "the North Sea would be
   completely filled up, and the British Islands again connected
   with the Continent."J. F., U.S.C._WILDEY'S DREAM._


    A blacksmith stood, at his anvil good,
          Just fifty years ago,
    And struck in his might, to the left and right,
          The iron all aglow.And fast and far, as each miniature star
          Illumined the dusky air,
    The sparks of his mind left a halo behind,
          Like the aureola of prayer.And the blacksmith thought, as he hammered and wrought,
          Just fifty years ago,
    Of the sins that start in the human heart
          When _its_ metal is all aglow;
    And he breathed a prayer, on the evening air,
          As he watched the fire-sparks roll,
    That with hammer and tongs, _he_ might right the wrongs
          That environ the human soul!When he leaned on his sledge, not like minion or drudge,
          With center in self alone,
    But with vision so grand, it embraced every land,
          In the sweep of its mighty zone;
    O'er mountain and main, o'er forest and plain,
          He gazed from his swarthy home,
    Till rafter and wall, grew up in a hall,
          That covered the world with its dome!'Neath that bending arch, with a tottering march
          All peoples went wailing by,
    To the music of groan, of sob, and of moan,
          To the grave that was yawning nigh,
    When the blacksmith rose and redoubled his blows
          On the iron that was aglow,
    Till his senses did seem to dissolve in a dream,
          Just fifty years ago.He thought that he stood upon a mountain chain,
    And gazed across an almost boundless plain;
    Men of all nations, and of every clime,
    Of ancient epochs, and of modern time,
    Rose in thick ranks before his wandering eye,
    And passed, like waves, in quick succession by.First came Osiris, with his Memphian band
    Of swarth Egyptians, darkening all the land;
    With heads downcast they dragged their limbs along,
    Laden with chains, and torn by lash and thong.From morn till eve they toiled and bled and died,
    And stained with blood the Nile's encroaching tide.Slowly upon the Theban plain there rose
    Old Cheop's pride, a pyramid of woes;
    And millions sank unpitied in their graves,
    With tombs inscribed--"Here lies a realm of slaves."Next came great Nimrod prancing on his steed,
    His serried ranks, Assyrian and Mede,
    By bold Sennacherib moulded into one,
    By bestial Sardanapalus undone.He saw the walls of Babylon arise,
    Spring from the earth, invade the azure skies,
    And bear upon their airy ramparts old
    Gardens and vines, and fruit, and flowers of gold.Beneath their cold and insalubrious shade
    All woes and vices had their coverts made;
    Lascivious incest o'er the land was sown,
    From peasant cabin to imperial throne,
    And that proud realm, so full of might and fame,
    Went down at last in blood, and sin, and shame.Then came the Persian, with his vast array
    Of armed millions, fretting for the fray,
    Led on by Xerxes and his harlot horde,
    Where billows swallowed, and where battle roared.On every side there rose a bloody screen,
    Till mighty Alexander closed the scene.in his pomp and pride,
    Dash through the world, and over myriads ride;
    Plant his proud pennon on the Gangean stream,
    Pierce where the tigers hide, mount where the eagles scream,
    And happy only amid war's alarms,
    The clank of fetters, and the clash of arms;
    And moulding man by battle-fields and blows,
    To one foul mass of furies, fiends and foes.Such, too, the Roman, vanquishing mankind,
    Their fields to ravage, and their limbs to bind;
    Whose proudest trophy, and whose highest good,
    To write his fame with pencil dipped in blood;
    To stride the world, like Ocean's turbid waves,
    And sink all nations into servient slaves.As passed the old, so modern realms swept by,
    Woe in all hearts, and tears in every eye;
    Crimes stained the noble, famine crushed the poor;
    Poison for kings, oppression for the boor;
    Force by the mighty, fraud by the feebler shown;
    Mercy a myth, and charity unknown.The Dreamer sighed, for sorrow filled his breast;
    Turned from the scene and sank to deeper rest.cried a low voice full of music sweet,
    "Come!"Down the steep hills they wend their toilsome way,
    Cross the vast plain that on their journey lay;
    Gain the dark city, through its suburbs roam,
    And pause at length within the dreamer's home.Again he stood at his anvil good
      With an angel by his side,
    And rested his sledge on its iron edge
      And blew up his bellows wide;
    He kindled the flame till the white heat came,
      Then murmured in accent low:
    "All ready am I your bidding to try
      So far as a mortal may go."'Midst the heat and the smoke the angel spoke,
      And breathed in his softest tone,
    "Heaven caught up your prayer on the evening air
      As it mounted toward the throne.God weaveth no task for mortals to ask
      Beyond a mortal's control,
    And with hammer and tongs you shall right the wrongs
      That encompass the human soul."But go you first forth '<DW41> the sons of the earth,
      And bring me a human heart
    That throbs for its kind, spite of weather and wind,
      And acts still a brother's part.The night groweth late, but here will I wait
      Till dawn streak the eastern skies;
    And lest you should fail, spread _my_ wings on the gale,
      And search with _my_ angel eyes."The dreamer once more passed the open door,
      But plumed for an angel's flight;
    He sped through the world like a thunderbolt hurled
      When the clouds are alive with light;
    He followed the sun till his race was won,
      And probed every heart and mind;
    But in every zone man labored alone
      For himself and not for his kind.All mournful and flushed, his dearest hopes crushed,
      The dreamer returned to his home,
    And stood in the flare of the forge's red glare,
      Besprinkled with dew and foam."The heart you have sought must be tempered and taught
      In the flame that is all aglow.""No heart could I find that was true to its kind,
      So I left all the world in its woe."Then the stern angel cried: "In your own throbbing side
      Beats a heart that is sound to the core;
    Will you give your own life to the edge of the knife
      For the widowed, the orphaned, and poor?""Most unworthy am I for my brothers to die,
      And sinful my sorrowing heart;
    But strike, if you will, to redeem or to kill,
      With life I am willing to part."Then he threw ope his vest and bared his broad breast
      To the angel's glittering blade;
    Soon the swift purple tide gushed a stream red and wide
      From the wound that the weapon had made.With a jerk and a start he then plucked out his heart,
      And buried it deep in the flame
    That flickered and fell like the flashes of hell
      O'er the dreamer's quivering frame."Now with hammer and tongs you may right all the wrongs
      That environ the human soul;
    But first, you must smite with a Vulcan's might
      The heart in yon blistering bowl."Quick the blacksmith arose, and redoubling his blows,
      Beat the heart that was all aglow,
    Till its fiery scars like a shower of stars
      Illumined the night with their flow.Every sling of his sledge reopened the edge
      Of wounds that were healed long ago;
    And from each livid chasm leaped forth a phantasm
      Of passion, of sin, or of woe.But he heeded no pain as he hammered amain,
      For the angel was holding the heart,
    And cried at each blow, "Strike high!"So he hammered and wrought, and he toiled and fought
      Till Aurora peeped over the plain;
    When the angel flew by and ascended the sky,
      _But left on the anvil a chain!_
    Its links were as bright as heaven's own light,
      As pure as the fountain of youth;
    And bore on each fold in letters of gold,
      This token--LOVE, FRIENDSHIP AND TRUTH.The dreamer awoke, and peered through the smoke
      At the anvil that slept by his side;
    And then in a wreath of flower-bound sheath,
      The triple-linked chain he espied.Odd Fellowship's gem is that bright diadem,
      Our emblem in age and in youth;
    For our hearts we must prove in the fire of LOVE,
      And mould with the hammer of TRUTH._WHITHERWARD._


By pursuing the analogies of nature, the human mind reduces to order the
vagaries of the imagination, and bodies them forth in forms of
loveliness and in similitudes of heaven.By an irrevocable decree of Nature's God, all his works are progressive
in the direction of himself.This law is traceable from the molehill up
to the mountain, from the mite up to the man.Geology, speaking to us
from the depths of a past eternity, from annals inscribed upon the
imperishable rock, utters not one syllable to contradict this tremendous
truth.Millions of ages ago, she commenced her impartial record, and as
we unroll it to-day, from the coal-bed and the marble quarry, we read in
creation's dawn as plainly as we behold in operation around us, the
mighty decree--ONWARD AND UPWARD, FOREVER!In the shadowy past this majestic globe floated through the blue ether,
a boiling flood of lava.Time was not;
for as yet the golden laws of Kepler had not emerged from chaos.The sun
had not hemmed his bright-eyed daughters in, nor marked out on the azure
concave the paths they were to tread.The planets were not worlds, but
shot around the lurid center liquid masses of flame and desolation.Comets sported at random through the sky, and trailed after them their
horrid skirts of fire.The Spirit of God had not "moved upon the face of
the waters," and rosy Chaos still held the scepter in his hand.As the coral worm toils on in the unfathomable
depths of ocean, laying in secret the foundations of mighty continents,
destined as the ages roll by to emerge into light and grandeur, so the
laws of the universe carried on their everlasting work.An eternity elapsed, and the age of fire passed away.A new era dawned
upon the earth.The gases were generated, and the elements of air and
water overspread the globe.Islands began to appear, at first presenting
pinnacles of bare and blasted granite; but gradually, by decay and
decomposition, changing into dank marshes and fertile plains.One after another the sensational universe now springs into being.This
but prepared the way for the animated, and that in turn formed the
groundwork and basis for the human.Man then came forth, the result of
all her previous efforts--nature's pet, her paragon and her pride.Reason sits enthroned upon his brow, and the soul wraps its sweet
affections about his heart; angels spread their wings above him, and God
calls him His child.He treads the earth its acknowledged monarch, and
commences its subjection.One by one the elements have yielded to his
sway, nature has revealed her hoariest secrets to his ken, and heaven
thrown wide its portals to his spirit.He stands now upon the very acme
of the visible creation, and with straining eye, and listening ear, and
anxious heart, whispers to himself that terrific and tremendous
word--WHITHERWARD!Late one afternoon in April, I was sitting on the grassy <DW72> of
Telegraph Hill, watching the waves of sunset as they rolled in from the
west, and broke in crimson spray upon the peaks of the Contra Costa
hills.I was alone; and, as my custom is, was ruminating upon the grand
problem of futurity.The broad and beautiful bay spread out like a sea
of silver at my feet, and the distant mountains, reflecting the rays of
the setting sun, seemed to hem it in with barriers of gold.The city lay
like a tired infant at evening in its mother's arms, and only at
intervals disturbed my reflections by its expiring sobs.The hours of
business I well knew had passed, and the heavy iron door had long since
grated on its hinges, and the fire-proof shutter been bolted for the
night.But I felt that my labors had just commenced.The duties of my
profession had swallowed up thought throughout the long hours devoted to
the cares of life, and it was not until I was released from their
thraldom that I found myself in truth a slave.The one master-thought
came back into my brain, until it burned its hideous image there in
letters of fire--WHITHERWARD!The past came up before me with its long memories of Egyptian grandeur,
with its triumphs of Grecian art, with its burden of Roman glory.Italy
came with her republics, her "starry" Galileo, and her immortal
Buonarotti.France flashed by, with her garments dyed in blood, and her
Napoleons in chains.England rose up with her arts and her arms, her
commerce and her civilization, her splendor and her shame.I beheld
Newton gazing at the stars, heard Milton singing of Paradise, and saw
Russell expiring on the scaffold.But ever and anon a pale,
thorn-crowned monarch, arrayed in mock-purple, and bending beneath a
cross, would start forth at my side, and with uplifted eye, but
speechless lip, point with one hand to the pages of a volume I had open
on my knee, and with the other to the blue heaven above.Judea would
then pass with solemn tread before me.Her patriarchs, her prophets and
her apostles, her judges, her kings, and her people, one by one came and
went like the phantasmagoria of a dream.The present then rose up in
glittering robes, its feet resting upon the mounds of Nimrod, its brow
encircled with a coronet of stars, pillaging, with one hand, the cloud
above of its lightnings, and sending them forth with the other, bridled
and subdued, to the uttermost ends of the earth.Earth's physical history also swept by in full
review.All nature lent her stores, and with an effort of mind, by no
means uncommon for those who have long thought upon a single subject, I
seemed to possess the power to generalize all that I had ever heard,
read or seen, into one gorgeous picture, and hang it up in the wide
heavens before me.The actual scenery around me entirely disappeared, and I beheld an
immense pyramid of alabaster, reared to the very stars, upon whose sides
I saw inscribed a faithful history of the past.Its foundations were in
deep shadow, but the light gradually increased toward the top, until its
summit was bathed in the most refulgent lustre.Inscribed in golden letters I read on one of its sides these words, in
alternate layers, rising gradually to the apex: "_Granite_, _Liquid_,
_Gas_, _Electricity_;" on another, "_Inorganic_, _Vegetable_, _Animal_,
_Human_;" on the third side, "_Consciousness_, _Memory_, _Reason_,
_Imagination_;" and on the fourth, "_Chaos_, _Order_, _Harmony_,
_Love_."At this moment I beheld the figure of a human being standing at the
base of the pyramid, and gazing intently upward.He then placed his foot
upon the foundation, and commenced climbing toward the summit.I caught
a distinct view of his features, and perceived that they were black and
swarthy like those of the most depraved Hottentot.He toiled slowly
upward, and as he passed the first layer, he again looked toward me, and
I observed that his features had undergone a complete transformation.He passed the second
layer; and as he entered the third, once more presented his face to me
for observation.Another change had overspread it, and I readily
recognized in him the tawny native of Malacca or Hindoostan.As he
reached the last layer, and entered its region of refulgent light, I
caught a full glimpse of his form and features, and beheld the high
forehead, the glossy ringlets, the hazel eye, and the alabaster skin of
the true Caucasian.I now observed for the first time that the pyramid was left unfinished,
and that its summit, instead of presenting a well-defined peak, was in
reality a level plain.In a few moments more, the figure I had traced
from the base to the fourth layer, reached the apex, and stood with
folded arms and upraised brow upon the very summit.His lips parted as
if about to speak, and as I leaned forward to hear, I caught, in
distinct tone and thrilling accent, that word which had so often risen
to my own lips for utterance, and seared my very brain, because
unanswered--WHITHERWARD!exclaimed I, aloud, shuddering at the sepulchral
sound of my voice."Home," responded a tiny voice at my side, and
turning suddenly around, my eyes met those of a sweet little
school-girl, with a basket of flowers upon her arm, who had approached
me unobserved, and who evidently imagined I had addressed her when I
spoke."Yes, little daughter," replied I, "'tis time to proceed
homeward, for the sun has ceased to gild the summit of Diavolo, and the
evening star is visible in the west.I will attend you home," and taking
her proffered hand, I descended the hill, with the dreadful word still
ringing in my ears, and the fadeless vision still glowing in my heart.#       #       #       #       #

Midnight had come and gone, and still the book lay open on my knee.The
candle had burned down close to the socket, and threw a flickering
glimmer around my chamber; but no indications of fatigue or slumber
visited my eyelids.My temples throbbed heavily, and I felt the hot and
excited blood playing like the piston-rod of an engine between my heart
and brain.I had launched forth on the broad ocean of speculation, and now
perceived, when too late, the perils of my situation.Above me were
dense and lowering clouds, which no eye could penetrate; around me
howling tempests, which no voice could quell; beneath me heaving
billows, which no oil could calm.I thought of Plato struggling with his
doubts; of Epicurus sinking beneath them; of Socrates swallowing his
poison; of Cicero surrendering himself to despair.I remembered how all
the great souls of the earth had staggered beneath the burden of the
same thought, which weighed like a thousand Cordilleras upon my own; and
as I pressed my hand upon my burning brow, I cried again and
again--WHITHERWARD!I could find no relief in philosophy; for I knew her maxims by heart
from Zeno and the Stagirite down to Berkeley and Cousin.I had followed
her into all her hiding-places, and courted her in all her moods.No
coquette was ever half so false, so fickle, and so fair.Her robes are
woven of the sunbeams, and a star adorns her brow; but she sits
impassive upon her icy throne, and wields no scepter but despair.The
light she throws around is not the clear gleam of the sunshine, nor the
bright twinkle of the star; but glances in fitful glimmerings on the
soul, like the aurora on the icebergs of the pole, and lightens up the
scene only to show its utter desolation.The Bible lay open before me, but I could find no comfort there.Its
lessons were intended only for the meek and humble, and my heart was
cased in pride.It reached only to the believing; I was tossed on an
ocean of doubt.It required, as a condition to faith, the innocence of
an angel and the humility of a child; I had long ago seared my
conscience by mingling in the busy scenes of life, and was proud of my
mental acquirements.The Bible spoke comfort to the Publican; I was of
the straight sect of the Pharisees.Its promises were directed to the
poor in spirit, whilst mine panted for renown.At this moment, whilst heedlessly turning over its leaves and scarcely
glancing at their contents, my attention was arrested by this remarkable
passage in one of Paul's epistles: "That was not _first_ which is
spiritual, but that which was natural, and _afterward_ that which is
spiritual.Behold, I show you a mystery: _we shall not all sleep_, but
we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the
last trump."Again and again I read this text, for it promised more by reflection
than at first appeared in the words.Slowly a light broke in on the
horizon's verge, and I felt, for the first time in my whole life, that
the past was not all inexplicable, nor the future a chaos, but that the
human soul, lit up by the torch of science!and guided by the
prophecies of Holy Writ, might predict the path it is destined to tread,
and read in advance the history of its final enfranchisement.Paul
evidently intended to teach the doctrine of _progress_, even in its
applicability to man.He did not belong to that narrow-minded sect in
philosophy, which declares that the earth and the heavens are finished;
that man is the crowning glory of his Maker, and the utmost stretch of
His creative power; that henceforth the globe which he inhabits is
barren, and can produce no being superior to himself.On the contrary,
he clearly intended to teach the same great truth which modern science
is demonstrating to all the world, that progression is nature's first
law, and that even in the human kingdom the irrevocable decree has gone
forth--ONWARD AND UPWARD, FOREVER!Such were my reflections when the last glimmer of the candle flashed up
like a meteor, and then as suddenly expired in night.I was glad that
the shadows were gone.Better, thought I, is utter darkness than that
poor flame which renders it visible.But I had suddenly grown rich in
thought.A clue had been furnished to the labyrinth in which I had
wandered from a child; a hint had been planted in the mind which it
would be impossible ever to circumscribe or extinguish.One letter had
been identified by which, like Champollion le Jeune, I could eventually
decipher the inscription on the pyramid.What are these spectral
apparitions which rear themselves in the human mind, and are called by
mortals _hints_?Who lodges them in the chambers of
the mind, where they sprout and germinate, and bud and blossom, and
bear?The Florentine caught one as it fell from the stars, and invented the
telescope to observe them.Columbus caught another, as it was whispered
by the winds, and they wafted him to the shores of a New World.Franklin
beheld one flash forth from the cloud, and he traced the lightnings to
their bourn.Another dropped from the skies into the brain of Leverrier,
and he scaled the very heavens, till he unburied a star.Rapidly was my mind working out the solution of the problem which had so
long tortured it, based upon the intimation it had derived from St.Paul's epistle, when most unexpectedly, and at the same time most
unwelcomely, I fell into one of those strange moods which can neither be
called sleep nor consciousness, but which leave their impress far more
powerfully than the visions of the night or the events of the day.I beheld a small egg, most beautifully dotted over, and stained.Whilst
my eye rested on it, it cracked; an opening was made _from within_, and
almost immediately afterward a bird of glittering plumage and mocking
song flew out, and perched on the bough of a rose-tree, beneath whose
shadow I found myself reclining.Before my surprise had vanished, I
beheld a painted worm at my feet, crawling toward the root of the tree
which was blooming above me.It soon reached the trunk, climbed into the
branches, and commenced spinning its cocoon.Hardly had it finished its
silken home, ere it came forth in the form of a gorgeous butterfly, and,
spreading its wings, mounted toward the heavens.Quickly succeeding
this, the same pyramid of alabaster, which I had seen from the summit of
Telegraph Hill late in the afternoon, rose gradually upon the view.It
was in nowise changed; the inscriptions on the sides were the same, and
the identical figure stood with folded arms and uplifted brow upon the
top.I now heard a rushing sound, such as stuns the ear at Niagara, or
greets it during a hurricane at sea, when the shrouds of the ship are
whistling to the blast, and the flashing billows are dashing against her
sides.Suddenly the pyramid commenced changing its form, and before many
moments elapsed it had assumed the rotundity of a globe, and I beheld it
covered with seas, and hills, and lakes, and mountains, and plains, and
fertile fields.But the human figure still stood upon its crest.Then
came forth the single blast of a bugle, such as the soldier hears on the
morn of a world-changing battle.Caesar heard it at Pharsalia, Titus at
Jerusalem, Washington at Yorktown, and Wellington at Waterloo.No lightning flash ever rended forest king from crest to root quicker
than the transformation which now overspread the earth.In a second of
time it became as transparent as crystal, and as brilliant as the sun.But in every other respect it preserved its identity.On casting my eyes
toward the human being, I perceived that he still preserved his
position, but his feet did not seem to touch the earth.He appeared to
be floating upon its arch, as the halcyon floats in the atmosphere.His
features were lit up with a heavenly radiance, and assumed an expression
of superhuman beauty.The thought crossed my mind, Can this be a spirit?As sudden as the
question came forth the response, "I am."But, inquired my mind, for my
lips did not move, you have never passed the portals of the grave?Again
I read in his features the answer, "For ages this earth existed as a
natural body, and all its inhabitants partook of its characteristics;
gradually it approached the spiritual state, and by a law like that
which transforms the egg into the songster, or the worm into the
butterfly, it has just accomplished one of its mighty cycles, and now
gleams forth with the refulgence of the stars.I did not die, but passed
as naturally into the spiritual world as the huge earth itself.Prophets
and apostles predicted this change many hundred years ago; but the blind
infatuation of our race did not permit them to realize its truth.Your
own mind, in common with the sages of all time, long brooded over the
idea, and oftentimes have you exclaimed, in agony and
dismay--WHITHERWARD!The revolution may not come in the year
allotted you, but so surely as St.Paul spoke inspiration, so surely as
science elicits truth, so surely as the past prognosticates the future,
the natural world must pass into the spiritual, and everything be
changed in the twinkling of an eye.your own ears may hear
the clarion note, your own eyes witness the transfiguration."Slowly the vision faded away, and left me straining my gaze into the
dark midnight which now shrouded the world, and endeavoring to calm my
heart, which throbbed as audibly as the hollow echoes of a drum.When
the morning sun peeped over the Contra Costa range, I still sat silent
and abstracted in my chair, revolving over the incidents of the night,
but thankful that, though the reason is powerless to brush away the
clouds which obscure the future, yet the imagination may spread its
wings, and, soaring into the heavens beyond them, answer the soul when
in terror she inquires--WHITHERWARD!_OUR WEDDING-DAY._


                   I.

    A dozen springs, and more, dear Sue,
      Have bloomed, and passed away,
    Since hand in hand, and heart to heart,
      We spent our wedding-day.Youth blossomed on our cheeks, dear Sue,
      Joy chased each tear of woe,
    When first we promised to be true,
      That morning long ago.Though many cares have come, dear Sue,
      To checker life's career,
    As down its pathway we have trod,
      In trembling and in fear.Still in the darkest storm, dear Sue,
      That lowered o'er the way,
    We clung the closer, while it blew,
      And laughed the clouds away.'Tis true, our home is humble, Sue,
      And riches we have not,
    But children gambol round our door,
      And consecrate the spot.Our sons are strong and brave, dear Sue,
      Our daughters fair and gay,
    But none so beautiful as you,
      Upon our wedding-day.No grief has crossed our threshold, Sue,
      No crape festooned the door,
    But health has waved its halcyon wings,
      And plenty filled our store.Then let's be joyful, darling Sue,
      And chase dull cares away,
    And kindle rosy hope anew,
      As on our wedding-day.[Decoration]

XVII._THE OLD YEAR AND THE NEW._


    One more flutter of time's restless wing,
    One more furrow in the forehead of spring;
    One more step in the journey of fate,
    One more ember gone out in life's grate;
    One more gray hair in the head of the sage,
    One more round in the ladder of age;
    One leaf more in the volume of doom,
    And one span less in the march to the tomb,
    Since brothers, we gathered around bowl and tree,
    And Santa Claus welcomed with frolic and glee.How has thy life been speeding
          Since Aurora, at the dawn,
        Peeped within thy portals, leading
          The babe year, newly born?Has thy soul been scorched by sorrow,
          Has some spectre nestled there?And with every new to-morrow,
          Sowed the seeds of fresh despair?Burst its chain with strength sublime,
        For behold!I bring another,
          And a fairer child of time.Have thy barns been brimming o'er?Will thy stature fit the niches
          Hewn for Hercules of yore?the rolling planet
          Starts on a nobler round.But perhaps across thy vision
          Death had cast its shadow there,
        And thy home, once all elysian,
          Now crapes an empty chair;
        Or happier, thy dominions,
          Spreading broad and deep and strong,
        Re-echo 'neath love's pinions
          To a pretty cradle song!God's blessing on your head;
        Joy for the living mother,
          Peace with the loving dead.[Decoration]

XVIII._A PAIR OF MYTHS:_

BEING A CHAPTER FROM AN UNPUBLISHED WORK.Eight days passed away unreckoned, and still I remained unconscious of
everything occurring around me.The morning of the ninth dawned, dragged
heavily along, and noon approached, whilst I lay in the same comatose
state.No alteration had taken place, except that a deeper and sounder
sleep seemed to have seized upon me; a symptom hailed by my physician
with joy, but regarded by my mother with increased alarm.Suddenly, the incautious closing of my chamber door, as my sister, Miss
Lucy Stanly, then in her fifteenth year, entered the apartment, aroused
me from slumber and oblivion.I endeavored to recall something
of the past, but memory for a long time refused its aid, and I appeared
as fatally and irremediably unconscious as ever.Gradually, however, my
shattered mind recovered its faculties, and in less than an hour after
my awakening, I felt perfectly restored.No pain tormented me, and no
torpor benumbed my faculties.I rapidly reviewed, mentally, the
occurrences of the day before, when, as I imagined, the disaster had
happened, and resolved at once to rise from my bed and prosecute my
intended journey.At this moment my father entered the apartment, and observing that I
was awake, ventured to speak to me kindly and in a very low tone.I
smiled at his uneasiness, and immediately relieved him from all
apprehension, by conversing freely and intelligibly of the late
catastrophe.He seized my hand a thousand
times, and pressed it again and again to his lips.At length,
remembering that my mother was ignorant of my complete restoration, he
rushed from the room, in order to be the first to convey the welcome
intelligence.My bed was soon surrounded by the whole family, chattering away, wild
with joy, and imprinting scores of kisses on my lips, cheeks and
forehead.The excitement proved too severe for me in my weak condition,
and had not the timely arrival of the physician intervened to clear my
chamber of every intruder, except Mamma Betty, as we all called the
nurse, these pages in all probability would never have arrested the
reader's eye.As it was, I suddenly grew very sick and faint; everything
around me assumed a deep green tinge, and I fell into a deathlike swoon.Another morning's sun was shining cheerily in at my window, when
consciousness again returned.The doctor was soon at my side, and
instead of prescribing physic as a remedy, requested my sister to sit at
my bedside, and read in a low tone any interesting little story she
might select.He cautioned her not to mention, even in the most casual
manner, _Mormonism_, _St.Louis_, or the _Moselle_, which order she most
implicitly obeyed; nor could all my ingenuity extract a solitary remark
in relation to either.My sister was not very long in making a selection; for, supposing what
delighted herself would not fail to amuse me, she brought in a
manuscript, carefully folded, and proceeded at once to narrate its
history.It was written by my father, as a sort of model or sampler for
my brothers and sisters, which they were to imitate when composition-day
came round, instead of "hammering away," as he called it, on moral
essays and metaphysical commonplaces.It was styled


THE KING OF THE NINE-PINS: A MYTH.Heinrich Schwarz, or Black Hal, as he was wont to be called, was an old
toper, but he was possessed of infinite good humor, and related a great
many very queer stories, the truth of which no one, that I ever heard
of, had the hardihood to doubt; for Black Hal had an uncommon share of
"Teutonic pluck" about him, and was at times very unceremonious in the
display of it.But Hal had a weakness--it was not liquor, for that was
his strength--which he never denied; _Hal was too fond of nine-pins_.He
had told me, in confidence, that "many a time and oft" he had rolled
incessantly for weeks together.I think I heard him say that he once
rolled for a month, day and night, without stopping a single moment to
eat or to drink, or even to catch his breath.I did not question his veracity at the time; but since, on reflection,
the fact seems almost incredible; and were it not that this sketch might
accidentally fall in his way, I might be tempted to show philosophically
that such a thing could not possibly be.And yet I have read of very
long fasts in my day--that, for instance, of Captain Riley in the Great
Sahara, and others, which will readily occur to the reader.But I must
not episodize, or I shall not reach my story.Black Hal was sitting late one afternoon in a Nine-Pin Alley, in the
little town of Kaatskill, in the State of New York--it is true, for he
said so--when a tremendous thunder-storm invested his retreat.His
companions, one by one, had left him, until, rising from his seat and
gazing around, he discovered that he was alone.The alley-keeper, too,
could nowhere be found, and the boys who were employed to set up the
pins had disappeared with the rest.It was growing very late, and Hal
had a long walk, and he thought it most prudent to get ready to start
home.The lightning glared in at the door and windows most vividly, and
the heavy thunder crashed and rumbled and roared louder than he had ever
heard it before.The rain, too, now commenced to batter down
tremendously, and just as night set in, Hal had just got ready to set
out.Hal first felt uneasy, next unhappy, and finally miserable.If he
had but a boy to talk to!A verse
that he learned in his boyhood, across the wide sea, came unasked into
his mind.It always came there precisely at the time he did not desire
its company.It ran thus:

    "Oh!for the might of dread Odin
       The powers upon him shed,
     For a sail in the good ship Skidbladnir,[A-236]
       And a talk with Mimir's head!"[B-236]

[Footnote A-236: The ship Skidbladnir was the property of Odin.He could
sail in it on the most dangerous seas, and yet could fold it up and
carry it in his pocket.][Footnote B-236: Mimir's head was always the companion of Odin.When he
desired to know what was transpiring in distant countries, he inquired
of Mimir, and always received a correct reply.]This verse was repeated over and over again inaudibly.Gradually,
however, his voice became a little louder, and a little louder still,
until finally poor Hal hallooed it vociferously forth so sonorously that
it drowned the very thunder.He had repeated it just seventy-seven
times, when suddenly a monstrous head was thrust in at the door, and
demanded, in a voice that sounded like the maelstrom, "What do _you_
want with Odin?""Oh, nothing--nothing in the world, I thank you, sir,"
politely responded poor Hal, shaking from head to foot.Here the head
was followed by the shoulders, arms, body and legs of a giant at least
forty feet high.Of course he came in on all fours, and approached in
close proximity to Black Hal.Hal involuntarily retreated, as far as he
could, reciting to himself the only prayer he remembered, "Now I lay me
down to sleep," etc.The giant did not appear desirous of pursuing Hal, being afraid--so Hal
said--that he would draw his knife on him.But be the cause what it
might, he seated himself at the head of the nine-pin alley, and shouted,
"Stand up!"As he did so, the nine-pins at the other end arose and took
their places."Now, sir," said he, turning again to Hal, "I'll bet you an ounce of
your blood I can beat you rolling."Hal trembled again, but meekly replied, "Please, sir, we don't bet
_blood_ nowadays--we bet _money_.""Blood's my money," roared forth the giant.Hal tried in
vain to hoist the window."Yes, sir," said Hal; and he thought as it was only _an ounce_, he could
spare that without much danger, and it might appease the monster's
appetite."Yes, sir," replied Hal, as he seized what he supposed to be the largest
and his favorite ball."What are you doing with Mimir's head?""I beg your pardon, most humbly," began Hal, as he let the bloody head
fall; "I did not mean any harm."Hal fell on his knees and recited most devoutly, "Now I lay me down,"
etc.I say," and the giant seized poor Hal by the collar
and set him on his feet.He now selected a large ball, and poising it carefully in his hand, ran
a few steps, and sent it whirling right in among the nine-pins; but what
was his astonishment to behold them jump lightly aside, and permit the
ball to pass in an avenue directly through the middle of the alley.The second and third ball met with no better success.Odin--for Hal said it was certainly he, as he had Mimir's head
along--now grasped a ball and rolled it with all his might; but long
before it reached the nine-pins, they had, every one of them, tumbled
down, and lay sprawling on the alley.said the giant, as he grinned most gleefully at poor Hal.Taking another ball, he
hurled it down the alley, and the same result followed."I give up the game," whined out Hal."Then you lose double," rejoined Odin.Hal readily consented to pay two ounces, for he imagined, by yielding at
once, he would so much the sooner get rid of his grim companion.As he
said so, Odin pulled a pair of scales out of his coat pocket, made
proportionably to his own size.He poised them upon a beam in the alley,
and drew forth what he denominated two ounces, and put them in one
scale.Each ounce was about the size of a twenty-eight pound weight, and
was quite as heavy.shouted the giant, as he
grasped the gasping and terrified gambler.He soon rolled up his
sleeves, and bound his arm with a pocket handkerchief.Next he drew
forth a lancet as long as a sword, and drove the point into the biggest
vein he could discover.When he returned to
consciousness, the sun was shining brightly in at the window, and the
sweet rumbling of the balls assured him that he still lay where the
giant left him.On rising to his feet he perceived that a large coagulum
of blood had collected where his head rested all night, and that he
could scarcely walk from the effects of his exhaustion.He returned
immediately home and told his wife all that had occurred; and though,
like some of the neighbors, she distrusted the tale, yet she never
intimated her doubts to Black Hal himself.The alley-keeper assured me
in a whisper, one day, that upon the very night fixed on by Hal for the
adventure, he was beastly drunk, and had been engaged in a fight with
one of his boon companions, who gave him a black eye and a bloody nose.But the alley-keeper was always jealous of Black Hal's superiority in
story telling; besides, he often drank too much himself, and I suspect
he originated the report he related to me in a fit of wounded pride, or
drunken braggadocio.One thing is certain, he never ventured to repeat
the story in the presence of Black Hal himself.#       #       #       #       #

In spite of the attention I endeavored to bestow on the marvelous
history of Black Hal and his grim companion, my mind occasionally
wandered far away, and could only find repose in communing with her who
I now discovered for the first time held in her own hands the thread of
my destiny.Lucy was not blind to these fits of abstraction, and
whenever they gained entire control of my attention, she would pause,
lay down the manuscript, and threaten most seriously to discontinue the
perusal, unless I proved a better listener.I ask no man's pardon for
declaring that my sister was an excellent reader.Most brothers, perhaps
think the same of most sisters; but there _was_ a charm in Lucy's accent
and a distinctness in her enunciation I have never heard excelled.Owing
to these qualities, as much, perhaps, as to the strangeness of the
story, I became interested in the fate of the drunken gambler, and when
Lucy concluded, I was ready to exclaim, "And pray where is Black Hal
now?"My thoughts took another direction, however, and I impatiently demanded
whether or not the sample story had been imitated.A guilty blush
assured me quite as satisfactorily as words could have done, that Miss
Lucy had herself made an attempt, and I therefore insisted that as she
had whetted and excited the appetite, it would be highly
unfraternal--(particularly in my present very precarious
condition)--that parenthesis settled the matter--to deny me the means of
satisfying it."But you'll laugh at me," timidly whispered my sister."Of course I shall," said I, "if your catastrophe is half as melancholy
as Black Hal's.But make haste, or I shall be off to St.But pray
inform me, what is the subject of your composition?""I believe, on my soul," responded I, laughing outright, "you girls
never think about anything else."I provoked no reply, and the manuscript being unfolded, my sister thus
attempted to elucidate


THE ORIGIN OF MARRIAGE.Professor Williams having ceased his manipulations, my eyes
involuntarily closed, and I became unconscious to everything occurring
around me.There's truth in mesmerism, after all, thought I, and being
in the clairvoyant state, I beheld a most beautiful comet at this moment
emerging from the constellation Taurus, and describing a curve about the
star Zeta, one of the Pleiades.and as this thought entered my brain, I grasped a hair in the tail of
the comet as it whizzed by me.I climbed up the glittering hair until I found myself seated very
comfortably on the comet's back, and was beginning to enjoy my starlit
ramble exceedingly, when I was suddenly aroused from my meditations by
the song of a heavenly minstrel, who, wandering from star to star and
system to system, sang the fate of other worlds and other beings to
those who would listen to his strains and grant him the rites of
hospitality.As I approached, his tones were suddenly changed, his voice
lowered into a deeper key, and gazing intently at me, or at what
evidenced my presence to his sight, thus began:

The flaming sword of the cherub, which had waved so frightfully above
the gate of the garden of Eden, had disappeared; the angel himself was
gone; and Adam, as he approached the spot where so lately he had enjoyed
the delights of heaven, beheld with astonishment and regret that
Paradise and all its splendors had departed from the earth forever.Where the garden lately bloomed, he could discover only the dark and
smouldering embers of a conflagration; a hard lava had incrusted itself
along the golden walks; the birds were flown, the flowers withered, the
fountains dried up, and desolation brooded over the scene.sighed the patriarch of men, "where are now the pleasures which I
once enjoyed along these peaceful avenues?Where are all those
beautiful spirits, given by Heaven to watch over and protect me?Each
guardian angel has deserted me, and the rainbow glories of Paradise have
flown.No more the sun shines out in undimmed splendor, for clouds array
him in gloom; the earth, forgetful of her verdure and her flowers,
produces thorns to wound and frosts to chill me.The very air, once all
balm and zephyrs, now howls around me with the voice of the storm and
the fury of the hurricane.No more the notes of peace and happiness
greet my ears, but the harsh tones of strife and battle resound on every
side.Nature has kindled the flames of discord in her own bosom, and
universal war has begun his reign!"And then the father of mankind hid his face in the bosom of his
companion, and wept the bitter tears of contrition and repentance."Oh, do not weep so bitterly, my Adam," exclaimed his companion."True,
we are miserable, but all is not yet lost; we have forfeited the smiles
of Heaven, but we may yet regain our lost place in its affections.Let
us learn from our misfortunes the anguish of guilt, but let us learn
also the mercy of redemption."Oh, talk not of happiness now," interrupted Adam; "that nymph who once
wailed at our side, attentive to the beck, has disappeared, and fled
from the companionship of such guilty, fallen beings as ourselves,
forever.""Not forever, Adam," kindly rejoined Eve; "she may yet be lurking among
these groves, or lie hid behind yon hills.""Then let us find her," quickly responded Adam; "you follow the sun,
sweet Eve, to his resting-place, whilst I will trace these sparkling
waters to their bourn.Let us ramble this whole creation o'er; and when
we have found her, let us meet again on this very spot, and cling to her
side, until the doom of death shall overtake us."And the eye of Adam beamed with hope, then kindled for the first time on
earth in the bosom of man; and he bade Eve his first farewell, and
started eastward in his search.Eve turned her face to the west, and set out on her allotted journey.The sun had shone a hundred times in midsummer splendor, and a hundred
times had hid himself in the clouds of winter, and yet no human foot had
trod the spot where the garden of Eden once bloomed.Adam had in vain
traced the Euphrates to the sea, and climbed the Himalaya Mountains.In
vain had he endured the tropical heats on the Ganges, and the winter's
cold in Siberia.He stood at last upon the borders of that narrow sea
which separates Asia from America, and casting a wistful glance to the
far-off continent, exclaimed: "In yon land, so deeply blue in the
distance, that it looks like heaven, Happiness may have taken refuge.I will return to Eden, and learn if
Eve, too, has been unsuccessful."And then he took one more look at the distant land, sighed his adieu,
and set out on his return.First child of misery, first daughter of despair!Poor Eve,
with the blue of heaven in her eye, and the crimson of shame upon her
lip!Poor Eve, arrayed in beauty, but hastening to decay--she, too, was
unsuccessful.Wandering in her westward way, the azure waters of the Mediterranean
soon gleamed upon her sight.She stood at length upon the pebbly shore,
and the glad waves, silent as death before, when they kissed her naked
feet, commenced that song still heard in their eternal roar.A mermaid
seemed to rise from the waters at her feet, and to imitate her every
motion.Her long dark tresses, her deep blue eyes, her rosy cheek, her
sorrowful look, all were reflected in the mermaid before her."Sweet spirit," said Eve, "canst thou inform me where the nymph
Happiness lies concealed?She always stood beside us in the garden of
Eden; but when we were driven from Paradise we beheld her no more."The lips of the mermaid moved, but Eve could hear no reply.mother of mankind, the crystal waters of every sea, reflecting thy
lovely image, still faithful to their trust, conceal a mermaid in their
bosom for every daughter of beauty who looks upon them!Neither the orange groves of the Arno, nor the vineyards of France;
neither the forests of Germania, nor the caves of Norway, concealed the
sought-for nymph.Her track was imprinted in the
sands of Sahara, by the banks of the Niger, on the rocks of Bengola, in
the vales of Abyssinia--but all in vain.Come, Death," cried Eve; "come now, and take me where thou
wilt.This world is a desert, for Happiness has left it desolate."A gentle slumber soon overcame the wearied child of sorrow, and in her
sleep a vision came to comfort her.She dreamed that she stood before an
aged man, whose hoary locks attested that the snows of many winters had
whitened them, and in whose glance she recognized the spirit of Wisdom."Aged Father," said Eve, "where is Happiness?"and then she burst into a
flood of tears."Comfort thyself, Daughter," mildly answered the old man; "Happiness yet
dwells on earth, but she is no longer visible.A temple is built for her
in every mortal's bosom, but she never ascends her throne until welcomed
there by the child of Honor and Love."The morning sun aroused Eve from her slumber, but did not dispel the
memory of her dream."I will return to Eden, and there await until the
child of Honor and Love shall enthrone in my bosom the lost nymph
Happiness;" and saying this, she turned her face to the eastward, and
thinking of Adam and her vision, journeyed joyfully along.The sun of Spring had opened the flowers and clothed the woods in
verdure; had freed the streams from their icy fetters, and inspired the
warbling world with harmony, when two forlorn and weary travelers
approached the banks of the river Pison; that river which had flowed
through the garden of Eden when the first sunshine broke upon the world.A hundred years had rolled away, and the echo of no human voice had
resounded through the deserted groves.At length the dusky figures
emerged from the overshadowing shrubbery, and raised their eyes into
each other's faces.One bound--one cry--and they weep for joy in each
other's arms.Adam related his sad and melancholy story, and then Eve soon finished
hers.But no sooner had she told her dream, than Adam, straining her to
his bosom, exclaimed:

"There is no mystery here, my Eve.If Happiness on earth be indeed the
child of Honor and Love, it must be in Matrimony alone.What else now
left us on earth can lay claim to the precious boon?Approved by heaven,
and cherished by man, in the holy bonds of Matrimony it must consist;
and if this be all, we need seek no further; it is ours!"They then knelt in prayer, and returned thanks to Heaven, that though
the garden of Eden was a wild, and the nymph Happiness no longer an
angel at their side, yet that her spirit was still present in every
bosom where the heart is linked to Honor and Love by the sacred ties of
Matrimony.[Decoration]

XIX._THE LAST OF HIS RACE._


    No further can fate tempt or try me,
      With guerdon of pleasure or pain;
    Ere the noon of my life has sped by me,
      The last of my race I remain.To that home so long left I might journey;
      But they for whose greeting I yearn,
    Are launched on that shadowy ocean
      Whence voyagers never return.My life is a blank in creation,
      My fortunes no kindred may share;
    No brother to cheer desolation,
      No sister to soften by prayer;
    No father to gladden my triumphs,
      No mother my sins to atone;
    No children to lean on in dying--
      I must finish my journey alone!In that hall, where their feet tripp'd before me,
      How lone would now echo my tread!While each fading portrait threw o'er me
      The chill, stony smile of the dead.One sad thought bewilders my slumbers,
      From eve till the coming of dawn:
    I cry out in visions, "_Where are they_?"And echo responds, "_They are gone_!"But fain, ere the life-fount grows colder,
      I'd wend to that lone, distant place,
    That row of green hillocks, where moulder
      The rest of my early doom'd race.There slumber the true and the manly,
      There slumber the spotless and fair;
    And when my last journey is ended,
      My place of repose be it there![Decoration]

XX._THE TWO GEORGES._


Between the years of our Lord 1730 and 1740, two men were born on
opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, whose lives were destined to exert
a commanding influence on the age in which they lived, as well as to
control the fortunes of many succeeding generations.One was by birth a plain peasant, the son of a Virginia farmer; the
other an hereditary Prince, and the heir of an immense empire.It will
be the main object of this sketch to trace the histories of these two
individuals, so dissimilar in their origin, from birth to death, and
show how it happened that one has left a name synonymous with tyranny,
whilst the other will descend to the lowest posterity, radiant with
immortal glory, and renowned the world over as the friend of virtue, the
guardian of liberty, and the benefactor of his race.Go with me for one moment to the crowded and splendid metropolis of
England.It is the evening of the 4th of June 1734.Some joyful event
must have occurred, for the bells are ringing merrily, and the
inhabitants are dressed in holiday attire.Nor is the circumstance of a
private nature, for banners are everywhere displayed, the vast city is
illuminated, and a thousand cannon are proclaiming it from their iron
throats.The population seem frantic with joy, and rush tumultuously
into each other's arms, in token of a national jubilee.Tens of
thousands are hurrying along toward a splendid marble pile, situated on
a commanding eminence, near the river Thames, whilst from the loftiest
towers of St.James's Palace the national ensigns of St.George and the
Red Cross are seen floating on the breeze.Within one of the most
gorgeously furnished apartments of that royal abode, the wife of
Frederic, Prince of Wales, and heir apparent to the British Empire, has
just been delivered of a son.The scions of royalty crowd into the
bed-chamber, and solemnly attest the event as one on which the destiny
of a great empire is suspended.The corridors are thronged with dukes,
and nobles, and soldiers, and courtiers, all anxious to bend the supple
knee, and bow the willing neck, to power just cradled into the world.A
Royal Proclamation soon follows, commemorating the event, and commanding
British subjects everywhere, who acknowledge the honor of Brunswick, to
rejoice, and give thanks to God for safely ushering into existence
George William Frederic, heir presumptive of the united crowns of Great
Britain and Ireland.Just twenty-two years afterward that child ascended
the throne of his ancestors as King George the Third.Let us now turn our eyes to the Western Continent, and contemplate a
scene of similar import, but under circumstances of a totally different
character.It is the 22d February, 1732.The locality is a distant
colony, the spot the verge of an immense, untrodden and unexplored
wilderness, the habitation a log cabin, with its chinks filled in with
clay, and its sloping roof patched over with clapboards.Snow covers the
ground, and a chill wintery wind is drifting the flakes, and moaning
through the forest.Two immense chimneys stand at either end of the
house, and give promise of cheerful comfort and primitive hospitality
within, totally in contrast with external nature.There are but four
small rooms in the dwelling, in one of which Mary Ball, the wife of
Augustine Washington, has just given birth to a son.No dukes or
marquises or earls are there to attest the humble event.There are no
princes of the blood to wrap the infant in the insignia of royalty, and
fold about his limbs the tapestried escutcheon of a kingdom.His first
breath is not drawn in the center of a mighty capitol, the air laden
with perfume, and trembling to the tones of soft music and the "murmurs
of low fountains."But the child is received from its Mother's womb by
hands imbrowned with honest labor, and laid upon a lowly couch,
indicative only of a backwoodsman's home and an American's inheritance.He, too, is christened George, and forty-three years afterward took
command of the American forces assembled on the plains of old Cambridge.But if their births were dissimilar, their rearing and education were
still more unlike.From his earliest recollection the Prince heard only
the language of flattery, moved about from palace to palace, just as
caprice dictated, slept upon the cygnet's down, and grew up in
indolence, self-will and vanity, a dictator from his cradle.The peasant
boy, on the other hand, was taught from his infancy that labor was
honorable, and hardships indispensable to vigorous health.He early
learned to sleep alone amid the dangers of a boundless wilderness, a
stone for his pillow, and the naked sod his bed; whilst the voices of
untamed nature around him sang his morning and his evening hymns.Truth,
courage and constancy were early implanted in his mind by a mother's
counsels, and the important lesson of life was taught by a father's
example, that when existence ceases to be useful it ceases to be happy.Early manhood ushered them both into active life; the one as king over
extensive dominions, the other as a modest, careful, and honest district
surveyor.Having traced the two Georges to the threshold of their career, let us
now proceed one step further, and take note of the first great public
event in the lives of either.For a long time preceding the year 1753 the French had laid claim to all
the North American continent west of the Alleghany Mountains, stretching
in an unbroken line from Canada to Louisiana.The English strenuously
denied this right, and when the French commandant on the Ohio, in 1753,
commenced erecting a fort near where the present city of Pittsburg
stands, and proceeded to capture certain English traders, and expel them
from the country, Dinwiddie, Governor of Virginia, deemed it necessary
to dispatch an agent on a diplomatic visit to the French commandant, and
demand by what authority he acted, by what title he claimed the country,
and order him immediately to evacuate the territory.George Washington, then only in his twenty-second year, was selected by
the Governor for this important mission.It is unnecessary to follow him, in all his perils, during his wintery
march through the wilderness.The historian of his life has painted in
imperishable colors his courage, his sagacity, his wonderful coolness in
the midst of danger, and the success which crowned his undertaking.The
memory loves to follow him through the trackless wilds of the forest,
accompanied by only a single companion, and making his way through
wintery snows, in the midst of hostile savages and wild beasts for more
than five hundred miles, to the residence of the French commander.How
often do we not shudder, as we behold the treacherous Indian guide, on
his return, deliberately raising his rifle, and leveling it at that
majestic form; thus endeavoring, by an act of treachery and cowardice,
to deprive Virginia of her young hero!with what fervent prayers
do we not implore a kind Providence to watch over his desperate
encounter with the floating ice, at midnight, in the swollen torrent of
the Alleghany, and rescue him from the wave and the storm.Standing
bareheaded on the frail raft, whilst in the act of dashing aside some
floating ice that threatened to ingulf him, the treacherous oar was
broken in his hand, and he is precipitated many feet into the boiling
current.for the destinies of millions yet
unborn hang upon that noble arm!In the early part of the year 1764 a
ministerial crisis occurs in England, and Lord Bute, the favorite of the
British monarch, is driven from the administration of the government.The troubles with the American colonists have also just commenced to
excite attention, and the young King grows angry, perplexed, and greatly
irritated.A few days after this, a rumor starts into circulation that
the monarch is sick.His attendants look gloomy, his friends terrified,
and even his physicians exhibit symptoms of doubt and danger.Yet he has
no fever, and is daily observed walking with uncertain and agitated step
along the corridors of the palace.His conduct becomes gradually more
and more strange, until doubt gives place to certainty, and the royal
medical staff report to a select committee of the House of Commons that
the King is threatened with _insanity_.For six weeks the cloud obscures
his mental faculties, depriving him of all interference with the
administration of the government, and betokening a sad disaster in the
future.His reason is finally restored, but frequent fits of passion,
pride and obstinacy indicate but too surely that the disease is seated,
and a radical cure impossible.Possessed now of the chief characteristics of George Washington and
George Guelph, we are prepared to review briefly their conduct during
the struggle that ensued between the two countries they respectively
represented.Let us now refer to the first act of disloyalty of Washington, the first
indignant spurn his high-toned spirit evinced under the oppressions of a
king.Not long after his return from the west, Washington was offered the
chief command of the forces about to be raised in Virginia, to expel the
French; but, with his usual modesty, he declined the appointment, on
account of his extreme youth, but consented to take the post of
lieutenant-colonel.Shortly afterward, on the death of Colonel Fry, he
was promoted to the chief command, but through no solicitations of his
own.Subsequently, when the war between France and England broke out in
Europe, the principal seat of hostilities was transferred to America,
and his Gracious Majesty George III sent over a large body of troops,
_under the command of favorite officers_.An
edict soon followed, denominated an "Order to settle the rank of the
officers of His Majesty's forces serving in America."By one of the
articles of this order, it was provided "that all officers commissioned
by the King, should take precedence of those of the same grade
commissioned by the governors of the respective colonies, although their
commissions might be of junior date;" and it was further provided, that
"when the troops served together, the provincial officers should enjoy
no rank at all."This order was scarcely promulgated--indeed, before the
ink was dry--ere the Governor of Virginia received a communication
informing him that _George Washington was no longer a soldier_.Entreaties, exhortations, and threats were all lavished upon him in
vain; and to those who, in their expostulations, spoke of the
defenseless frontiers of his native State, he patriotically but nobly
replied: "I will serve my country when I can do so without dishonor."In contrast with this attitude of Washington, look at the conduct of
George the Third respecting the colonies, after the passage of the Stamp
Act.This act was no sooner proclaimed in America, than the most violent
opposition was manifested, and combinations for the purpose of effectual
resistance were rapidly organized from Massachusetts to Georgia.The
leading English patriots, among whom were Burke and Barre, protested
against the folly of forcing the colonies into rebellion, and the city
of London presented a petition to the King, praying him to dismiss the
Granville ministry, and repeal the obnoxious act."It is with the utmost
astonishment," replied the King, "that I find any of my subjects capable
of encouraging the rebellious disposition that unhappily exists in some
of my North American colonies.Having entire confidence in the wisdom of
my parliament, the great council of the realm, I will steadily pursue
those measures which they have recommended for the support of the
constitutional rights of Great Britain."He heeded not the memorable
words of Burke, that afterward became prophetic."There are moments,"
exclaimed this great statesman, "critical moments in the fortunes of all
states when they who are too weak to contribute to your prosperity may
yet be strong enough to complete your ruin."The Boston port bill
passed, and the first blood was spilt at Lexington.It is enough to say of the long and bloody war that followed, that
George the Third, by his obstinacy, contributed more than any other man
in his dominion to prolong the struggle, and affix to it the stigma of
cruelty, inhumanity and vengeance; whilst Washington was equally the
soul of the conflict on the other side, and by his imperturbable
justice, moderation and firmness, did more than by his arms to convince
England that her revolted colonists were invincible.It is unnecessary to review in detail the old Revolution.Let us pass to
the social position of the two Georges in after-life.On the 2d August, 1786, as the King was alighting from his carriage at
the gate of St.James, an attempt was made on his life by a woman named
Margaret Nicholson, who, under pretense of presenting a petition,
endeavored to stab him with a knife which was concealed in the paper.The weapon was an old one, and so rusty that, on striking the vest of
the King, it bent double, and thus preserved his life.On the 29th
October, 1795, whilst his majesty was proceeding to the House of Lords,
a ball passed through both windows of the carriage.James the mob threw stones into the carriage, several of which struck
the King, and one lodged in the cuff of his coat.The state carriage was
completely demolished by the mob.But it was on the 15th May, 1800, that
George the Third made his narrowest escapes.In the morning of that
day, whilst attending the field exercise of a battalion of guards, one
of the soldiers loaded his piece with a bullet and discharged it at the
King.The ball fortunately missed its aim, and lodged in the thigh of a
gentleman who was standing in the rear.In the evening of the same day a
more alarming circumstance occurred at the Drury Lane Theatre.At the
moment when the King entered the royal box, a man in the pit, on the
right-hand side of the orchestra, suddenly stood up and discharged a
large horse-pistol at him.The hand of the would-be assassin was thrown
up by a bystander, and the ball entered the box just above the head of
the King.Such were the public manifestations of affection for this royal tyrant.He was finally attacked by an enemy that could not be thwarted, and on
the 20th December, 1810, he became a confirmed lunatic.In this dreadful
condition he lingered until January, 1820, when he died, having been the
most unpopular, unwise and obstinate sovereign that ever disgraced the
English throne.He was forgotten as soon as life left his body, and was
hurriedly buried with that empty pomp which but too often attends a
despot to the grave.His whole career is well summed up by Allan Cunningham, his biographer,
in few words: "Throughout his life he manifested a strong disposition to
be his own minister, and occasionally placed the kingly prerogatives in
perilous opposition to the resolutions of the nation's representatives.His interference with the deliberations of the upper house, as in the
case of Fox's Indian bill, was equally ill-judged and dangerous._The
separation of America from the mother country, at the time it took
place, was the result of the King's personal feelings and interference
with the ministry._ The war with France was, in part at least,
attributable to the views and wishes of the sovereign of England.His
obstinate refusal to grant any concessions to his Catholic subjects,
kept his cabinet perpetually hanging on the brink of dissolution, and
threatened the dismemberment of the kingdom.He has been often praised
for firmness, but it was in too many instances the firmness of
obstinacy; a dogged adherence to an opinion once pronounced, or a
resolution once formed."The mind, in passing from the unhonored grave of the prince to the last
resting-place of the peasant boy, leaps from a kingdom of darkness to
one of light.Let us now return to the career of Washington.Throughout the
Revolutionary War he carried, like Atropos, in his hand the destinies of
millions; he bore, like Atlas, on his shoulders the weight of a world.It is unnecessary to follow him throughout his subsequent career.Honored again and again by the people of the land he had redeemed from
thraldom, he has taken his place in death by the side of the wisest and
best of the world's benefactors.Assassins did not unglory him in life,
nor has oblivion drawn her mantle over him in death.The names of his
great battle-fields have become nursery words, and his principles have
imbedded themselves forever in the national character.Every pulsation
of our hearts beats true to his memory.His mementoes are everywhere
around and about us.Distant as we are from the green fields of his
native Westmoreland, the circle of his renown has spread far beyond our
borders.In climes where the torch of science was never kindled; on
shores still buried in primeval bloom; amongst barbarians where the face
of liberty was never seen, the Christian missionary of America, roused
perhaps from his holy duties by the distant echo of the national salute,
this day thundering amidst the billows of every sea, or dazzled by the
gleam of his country's banner, this day floating in every wind of
heaven, pauses over his task as a Christian, and whilst memory kindles
in his bosom the fires of patriotism, pronounced in the ear of the
enslaved pagan the venerated name of WASHINGTON!Nor are the sons of the companions of Washington alone in doing justice
to his memory.Our sisters, wives and mothers compete with us in
discharging this debt of national gratitude.With a delicacy that none
but woman could exhibit, and with a devotion that none but a daughter
could feel, they are now busy in executing the noble scheme of
purchasing his tomb, in order for endless generations to stand sentinel
over his remains.ye daughters
of America; enfold them closer to your bosom than your first-born
offspring; build around them a mausoleum that neither time nor change
can overthrow; for within them germinates the seeds of liberty for the
benefit of millions yet unborn.Wherever tyranny shall lift its Medusan
head, wherever treason shall plot its hellish schemes, wherever disunion
shall unfurl its tattered ensign, there, oh there, sow them in the
hearts of patriots and republicans!For from these pale ashes there
shall spring, as from the dragon's teeth sown by Cadmus of old on the
plains of Heber, vast armies of invincible heroes, sworn upon the altar
and tomb at Mount Vernon, to live as freemen, or as such to die!_MASONRY._


    Oh, sacred spirit of Masonic love,
    Offspring of Heaven, the angels' bond above,
    Guardian of peace and every social tie,
    How deep the sources of thy fountains lie!How wide the realms that 'neath thy wings expand,
    Embracing every clime, encircling every land!Beneath the aurora of the Polar skies,
    Where Greenland's everlasting glaciers rise,
    The Lodge mysterious lifts its snow-built dome,
    And points the brother to a sunnier home;
    Where Nilus slays the sacrificial kid,
    Beneath the shadow of her pyramid,
    Where magian suns unclasp the gaping ground,
    And far Australia's golden sands abound;
    Where breakers thunder on the coral strand,
    To guard the gates of Kamehameha's land;
    Wherever man, in lambskin garb arrayed,
    Strikes in defense of innocence betrayed;
    Lifts the broad shield of charity to all,
    And bends in anguish o'er a brother's fall;
    Where the bright symbol of Masonic truth,
    Alike for high and low, for age or youth,
    Flames like yon sun at tropic midday's call,
    And opes the universal eye on all!What though in secret all your alms be done,
    Your foes all vanquished and your trophies won?What though a veil be o'er your Lodges thrown,
    And brother only be to brother known?In secret, God built up the rolling world;
    In secret, morning's banners are unfurled;
    In secret, spreads the leaf, unfolds the flower,
    Revolve the spheres, and speeds the passing hour.The day is noise, confusion, strife, turmoil,
    Struggles for bread, and sweat beneath the toil.The night is silence--progress without jars,
    The rest of mortals and the march of stars!The day for work to toiling man was given;
    But night, to lead his erring steps to Heaven.Who feed the hungry, heed the orphan's cry;
    Who clothe the naked, dry the widow's tear,
    Befriend the exile, bear the stranger's bier;
    Stand round the bedside when the fluttering soul
    Bursts her clay bonds and parteth for her goal;
    God speed you in the noble path you tread,
    Friends of the living, mourners o'er the dead.May all your actions, measured on the square,
    Be just and righteous, merciful and fair;
    Your thoughts flow pure, in modesty of mind,
    Along the equal level of mankind;
    Your words be troweled to truth's perfect tone,
    Your fame be chiseled in unblemished stone,
    Your hearts be modeled on the plummet's line,
    Your faith be guided by the Book divine;
    And when at last the gavel's beat above
    Calls you from labor to the feast of love,
    May mighty Boaz, pillar'd at that gate
    Which seraphs tyle and where archangels wait,
    Unloose the bandage from your dazzled eyes,
    Spell out the _Password_ to Arch-Royal skies;
    Upon your bosom set the signet steel,
    Help's sign disclose, and Friendship's grip reveal;
    Place in your grasp the soul's unerring rod,
    And light you to the Temple of your God!_POLLOCK'S EUTHANASIA._


    He is gone!By his own strong pinions lifted
                      To the stars;

    Where he strikes, with minstrels olden,
    Choral harps, whose strings are golden,
                      Deathless bars.There, with Homer's ghost all hoary,
    Not with years, but fadeless glory,
                      Lo!he stands;

    And through that open portal,
    We behold the bards immortal
                      Clasping hands!how Rome's great epic master
    Sings, that death is no disaster
                      To the wise;

    Fame on earth is but a menial,
    But it reigns a king perennial
                      In the skies!Albion's blind old bard heroic,
    Statesman, sage, and Christian stoic,
                      Greets his son;

    Whilst in paeans wild and glorious,
    Like his "Paradise victorious,"
                      Sings, Well done!a bard with forehead pendent,
    But with glory's beams resplendent
                      As a star;

    Slow descends from regions higher,
    With a crown and golden lyre
                      In his car.All around him, crowd as minions,
    Thrones and sceptres, and dominions,
                      Kings and Queens;

    Ages past and ages present,
    Lord and dame, and prince and peasant,
                      His demesnes!young bard hesperian,
    Welcome to the heights empyrean,
                      Thou did'st sing,

    Ere yet thy trembling fingers
    Struck where fame immortal lingers,
                      In the string.I am the bard of Avon,
    And the Realm of song in Heaven
                      Is my own;

    Long thy verse shall live in story,
    And thy Lyre I crown with glory,
                      And a throne!_SCIENCE, LITERATURE AND ART DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE NINETEENTH
CENTURY._


Looking back into the past, and exploring by the light of authentic
history, sacred as well as profane, the characteristics of former ages,
the merest tyro in learning cannot fail to perceive that certain epochs
stand prominently out on the "sands of time," and indicate vast activity
and uncommon power in the human mind.These epochs are so well marked that history has given them a
designation, and to call them by their name, conjures up, as by the wand
of an enchanter, the heroic representatives of our race.If, for instance, we should speak of the era of Solomon, in sacred
history, the memory would instantly picture forth the pinnacles of the
Holy Temple, lifting themselves into the clouds; the ear would listen
intently to catch the sweet intonations of the harp of David, vocal at
once with the prophetic sorrows of his race, and swelling into sublime
ecstasy at the final redemption of his people; the eye would glisten at
the pomp and pageantry of the foreign potentates who thronged his court,
and gloat with rapture over the beauty of the young Queen of Sheba, who
journeyed from a distant land to seek wisdom at the feet of the wisest
monarch that ever sat upon a throne.We should behold his ships
traversing every sea, and pouring into the lap of Israel the gold of
Ophir, the ivory of Senegambia, and the silks, myrrh, and spices of the
East.So, too, has profane history its golden ages, when men all seemed to be
giants, and their minds inspired.What is meant when we speak of the age of Pericles?We mean all that is
glorious in the annals of Greece.We mean Apelles with his pencil,
Phidias with his chisel, Alcibiades with his sword.We seem to be
strolling arm-in-arm with Plato, into the academy, to listen to the
divine teachings of Socrates, or hurrying along with the crowd toward
the theatre, where Herodotus is reading his history, or Euripides is
presenting his tragedies.Aspasia rises up like a beautiful apparition
before us, and we follow willing slaves at the wheels of her victorious
chariot.The whole of the Peloponnesus glows with intellect like a forge
in blast, and scatters the trophies of Grecian civilization profusely
around us.The Parthenon lifts its everlasting columns, and the Venus
and Apollo are moulded into marble immortality.Rome had her Augustan age, an era of poets, philosophers, soldiers,
statesmen, and orators.Crowded into contemporary life, we recognize the
greatest general of the heathen world, the greatest poet, the greatest
orator, and the greatest statesman of Rome.Caesar and Cicero, Virgil and
Octavius, all trod the pavement of the capitol together, and lent their
blended glory to immortalize the Augustan age.Italy and Spain and France and England have had their golden age.The
eras of Lorenzo the Magnificent, of Ferdinand and Isabella, of Louis
Quatorze and of Elizabeth, can never be forgotten.They loom up from the
surrounding gloom like the full moon bursting upon the sleeping seas;
irradiating the night, clothing the meanest wave in sparkling silver,
and dimming the lustre of the brightest stars.History has also left in
its track mementoes of a different character.In sacred history we have
the age of Herod; in profane, the age of Nero.We recognize at a glance
the talismanic touch of the age of chivalry, and the era of the
Crusades, and mope our way in darkness and gloom along that opaque
track, stretching from the reign of Justinian, in the sixth century, to
the reign of Edward the Third, in the fourteenth, and known throughout
Christendom as the "Dark Ages."Let us now take a survey of the field we
occupy, and ascertain, if possible, the category in which our age shall
be ranked by our posterity.But before proceeding to discuss the characteristics of our epoch, let
us define more especially what that epoch embraces.It does not embrace the American nor the French Revolution, nor does it
include the acts or heroes of either.The impetus given to the human
mind by the last half of the eighteenth century, must be carefully
distinguished from the impulses of the first half of the nineteenth.The
first was an era of almost universal war, the last of almost
uninterrupted peace.The dying ground-swell of the waves after a storm
belong to the tempest, not to the calm which succeeds.Hence the wars of
Napoleon, the literature and art of his epoch, must be excluded from
observation, in properly discussing the true characteristics of our era.De Stael and Goethe and Schiller and Byron; Pitt and Nesselrode,
Metternich and Hamilton; Fichte and Stewart and Brown and Cousin;
Canova, Thorwaldsen and La Place, though all dying since the beginning
of this century, belong essentially to a former era.They were the
ripened fruits of that grand uprising of the human mind which first
took form on the 4th day of July, 1776.Our era properly commences with
the downfall of the first Napoleon, and none of the events connected
therewith, either before or afterward, can be philosophically classed in
the epoch we represent, but must be referred to a former period.Ages
hence, then, the philosophic critic will thus describe the first half of
the nineteenth century:

  "The normal state of Christendom was peace.The age of steel that
  immediately went before it had passed."Speculative philosophy fell asleep; literature declined;
  Skepticism bore sway in religion, politics, and morals; Utility
  became the universal standard of right and wrong, and the truths
  of every science and the axioms of every art were ruthlessly
  subjected to the _experimentum crucis_.The verdicts pronounced in the olden time against
  Mohammed and Mesmer and Robespierre were set aside, and a new
  trial granted.The ghosts of Roger Bacon and Emanuel Swedenborg
  were summoned from the Stygian shore to plead their causes anew
  before the bar of public opinion.The head of Oliver Cromwell was
  ordered down from the gibbet, the hump was smoothed down on the
  back of Richard III, and the sentence pronounced by Urban VIII
  against the'starry Galileo' reversed forever.Aristotle was
  decently interred beneath a modern monument inscribed thus: '_In
  pace requiescat_;' whilst Francis Bacon was rescued from the
  sacrilegious hands of kings and peers and parliament, and
  canonized by the unanimous consent of Christendom.Germany led the van, and
  Humboldt became the impersonation of his times."Such unquestionably will be the verdict of the future, when the present
time, with all its treasures and trash, its hopes and realizations,
shall have been safely shelved and labeled amongst the musty records of
bygone generations.Let us now examine into the grounds of this verdict more minutely, and
test its accuracy by exemplifications.I. And first, who believes now in _innate ideas_?Locke has been
completely superseded by the materialists of Germany and France, and all
speculative moral philosophy exploded.The audiences of Edinburgh and
Brown University interrupt Sir William Hamilton and Dr.Wayland in their
discourses, and, stripping off the plumage from their theses,
inquisitively demand, "_Cui bono_?"How can
we apply it to the every-day concerns of life?We ask you for bread and
you have given us a stone; and though that stone be a diamond, it is
valueless, except for its glitter.No philosopher can speculate
successfully or even satisfactorily to himself, when he is met at every
turn by some vulgar intruder into the domains of Aristotle and Kant, who
clips his wings just as he was prepared to soar into the heavens, by an
offer of copartnership to "speculate," it may be, in the price of pork.Hence, no moral philosopher of our day has been enabled to erect any
theory which will stand the assaults of logic for a moment.Each school
rises for an instant to the surface, and sports out its little day in
toss and tribulation, until the next wave rolls along, with foam on its
crest and fury in its roar, and overwhelms it forever.As with its
predecessor, so with itself."The eternal surge
    Of Time and Tide rolls on and bears afar
    Their bubbles: as the old burst, new emerge,
    Lashed from the foam of ages."But I have stated that this is an age of _literary decline_.It is
true that more books are written and published, more newspapers and
periodicals printed and circulated, more extensive libraries collected
and incorporated, and more ink indiscriminately spilt, than at any
former period of the world's history.In looking about us we are
forcibly reminded of the sarcastic couplet of Pope, who complains--

    "That those who cannot write, and those who can,
     All scratch, all scrawl, and scribble to a man."Had a modern gentleman all the eyes of Argus, all the hands of Briareus,
all the wealth of Croesus, and lived to the age of Methuselah, his
eyes would all fail, his fingers all tire, his money all give out, and
his years come to an end, long before he perused one tenth of the annual
product of the press of Christendom at the present day.It is no figure
of rhetoric to say that the press groans beneath the burden of its
labors.Could the types of Leipsic and London, Paris and New York, speak
out, the Litany would have to be amended, and a new article added, to
which they would solemnly respond: "Spare us, good Lord!"A recent publication furnishes the following statistical facts relating
to the book trade in our own country: "Books have multiplied to such an
extent in the United States that it now takes 750 paper-mills, with 2000
engines in constant operation, to supply the printers, who work day and
night, endeavoring to keep their engagements with publishers.These
tireless mills produce 270,000,000 pounds of paper every year.It
requires a pound and a quarter of old rags for one pound of paper, thus
340,000,000 pounds of rags were consumed in this way last year.There
are about 300 publishers in the United States, and near 10,000
book-sellers who are engaged in the task of dispensing literary pabulum
to the public."It may appear somewhat paradoxical to assert that literature is
declining whilst books and authors are multiplying to such a fearful
extent.Byron wrote:

    "'Tis pleasant, sure, to see one's name in print;
     A book's a book, although there's nothing in 't."True enough; but books are not always literature.A man may become an
author without ceasing to be an ignoramus.His name may adorn a
title-page without being recorded _in aere perenne_.He may attempt to
write himself up a very "lion" in literature, whilst good master Slender
may be busily engaged "in writing him down an ass."Not one book in a thousand is a success; not one success in ten thousand
wreathes the fortunate author with the laurel crown, and lifts him up
into the region of the immortals.Tell me, ye who prate about the
_literary glory_ of the nineteenth century, wherein it consists?Whose
are

    "The great, the immortal names
     That were not born to die?"I cast my eyes up the long vista toward the Temple of Fame, and I behold
hundreds of thousands pressing on to reach the shining portals.They
jostle each other by the way, they trip, they fall, they are overthrown
and ruthlessly trampled into oblivion, by the giddy throng, as they rush
onward and upward.One, it may be two, of the million who started out,
stand trembling at the threshold, and with exultant voices cry aloud for
admittance.One perishes before the summons can be answered; and the
other, awed into immortality by the august presence into which he
enters, is transformed into imperishable stone.Let us carefully scan the rolls of the literature of our era, and
select, if we can, poet, orator, or philosopher, whose fame will deepen
as it runs, and brighten as it burns, until future generations shall
drink at the fountain and be refreshed, and kindle their souls at the
vestal flame and be purified, illuminated and ennobled.In poetry, aye, in the crowded realms of song, who bears the
sceptre?--who wears the crown?America, England, France and Germany can
boast of bards _by the gross_, and rhyme _by the acre_, but not a single
poet.The _poeta nascitur_ is not here.He may be on his way--and I have
heard that he was--but this generation must pass before he arrives.Is it Poe, croaking sorrowfully with
his "Raven," or Willis, cooing sweetly with his "Dove"?Is it Bryant,
with his "Thanatopsis," or Prentice, with his "Dirge to the Dead Year"?Perhaps it is Holmes, with his "Lyrics," or Longfellow, with his
"Idyls."is it not self-evident that we have no poet, when it is
utterly impossible to discover any two critics in the land who can find
him?True, we have lightning-bugs enough, but no star; foot-hills, it may be,
in abundance, but no Mount Shasta, with its base built upon the
everlasting granite, and its brow bathed in the eternal sunlight.In England, Tennyson, the Laureate, is the spokesman of a clique, the
pet poet of a princely circle, whose rhymes flow with the docility and
harmony of a limpid brook, but never stun like Niagara, nor rise into
sublimity like the storm-swept sea.Beranger, the greatest poet of France of our era, was a mere
song-writer; and Heine, the pride of young Germany, a mere satirist and
lyrist.Freiligrath can never rank with Goethe or Schiller; and Victor
Hugo never attain the heights trodden by Racine, Corneille, or Boileau.In oratory, where shall we find the compeer of Chatham or Mirabeau,
Burke or Patrick Henry?I have not forgotten Peel and Gladstone, nor
Lamartine and Count Cavour, nor Sargent S. Prentiss and Daniel Webster.But Webster himself, by far the greatest intellect of all these, was a
mere debater, and the spokesman of a party.He was an eloquent speaker,
but can never rank as an orator with the rhetoricians of the last
century.And in philosophy and general learning, where shall we find the equal of
that burly old bully, Dr.and yet Johnson, with all his
learning, was a third-rate philosopher.In truth, the greatest author of our era was a mere essayist.Beyond all
controversy, Thomas Babington Macaulay was the most polished writer of
our times.With an intellect acute, logical and analytic; with an
imagination glowing and rich, but subdued and under perfect control;
with a style so clear and limpid and concise, that it has become a
standard for all who aim to follow in the path he trod, and with a
learning so full and exact, and exhaustive, that he was nicknamed, when
an undergraduate, the "Omniscient Macaulay;" he still lacks the giant
grasp of thought, the bold originality, and the intense, earnest
enthusiasm which characterize the master-spirits of the race, and
identify them with the eras they adorn.As in literature, so in what have been denominated by scholars the
_Fine Arts_.The past fifty years has not produced a painter, sculptor,
or composer, who ranks above mediocrity in their respective vocations.Canova and Thorwaldsen were the last of their race; Sir Joshua
Reynolds left no successor, and the immortal Beethoven has been
superseded by <DW64> minstrelsy and senseless pantomime.The greatest
architect of the age is a railroad contractor, and the first dramatist a
cobbler of French farces.But whilst the highest faculty of the mind--the imagination--has
been left uncultivated, and has produced no worthy fruit, the next
highest, the casual, or the one that deals with causes and effects, has
been stimulated into the most astonishing fertility.Our age ignores fancy, and deals exclusively with fact.Within its
chosen range it stands far, very far pre-eminent over all that have
preceded it.It reaps the fruit of Bacon's labors.It stands thoughtfully on the field of Waterloo, and
estimates scientifically the manuring properties of bones and blood.It
disentombs the mummy of Thotmes II, sells the linen bandages for the
manufacture of paper, burns the asphaltum-soaked body for firewood, and
plants the pint of red wheat found in his sarcophagus, to try an
agricultural experiment.It deals in no sentimentalities; it has no
appreciation of the sublime.It stands upon the ocean shore, but with
its eyes fixed on the yellow sand searching for gold.It confronts
Niagara, and, gazing with rapture at its misty shroud, exclaims, in an
ecstasy of admiration, "Lord, what a place to sponge a coat!"Having no
soul to save, it has no religion to save it.It has discovered that
Mohammed was a great benefactor of his race, and that Jesus Christ was,
after all, a mere man; distinguished, it is true, for his benevolence,
his fortitude and his morality, but for nothing else.It does not
believe in the Pope, nor in the Church, nor in the Bible.It ridicules
the infallibility of the first, the despotism of the second, and the
chronology of the third.It is possessed of the very spirit of Thomas;
it must "touch and handle" before it will believe.It questions the
existence of spirit, because it cannot be analyzed by chemical solvents;
it questions the existence of hell, because it has never been scorched;
it questions the existence of God, because it has never beheld Him.It does, however, believe in the explosive force of gunpowder, in the
evaporation of boiling water, in the head of the magnet, and in the
heels of the lightnings.It conjugates the Latin verb _invenio_ (to find
out) through all its voices, moods and tenses.It invents everything;
from a lucifer match in the morning to kindle a kitchen fire, up through
all the intermediate ranks and tiers and grades of life, to a telescope
that spans the heavens in the evening, it recognizes no chasm or hiatus
in its inventions.It sinks an artesian well in the desert of Sahara for
a pitcher of water, and bores through the Alleghanies for a hogshead of
oil.From a fish-hook to the Great Eastern, from a pocket deringer to a
columbiad, from a sewing machine to a Victoria suspension bridge, it
oscillates like a pendulum.Deficient in literature and art, our age surpasses all others in
science.Knowledge has become the great end and aim of human life."I
want to know," is inscribed as legibly on the hammer of the geologist,
the crucible of the chemist, and the equatorial of the astronomer, as it
is upon the phiz of a regular "Down-Easter."Our age has inherited the
chief failing of our first mother, and passing by the "Tree of Life in
the midst of the Garden," we are all busily engaged in mercilessly
plundering the Tree of Knowledge of all its fruit.The time is rapidly
approaching when no man will be considered a gentleman who has not filed
his _caveat_ in the Patent Office.The inevitable result of this spirit of the age begins already to be
seen.The philosophy of a cold, blank, calculating materialism has taken
possession of all the avenues of learning.Epicurus is worshiped instead
of Christ.Mammon is considered as the only true savior._Dum Vivimus
Vivamus_, is the maxim we live by, and the creed we die by.Peter has
surrendered his keys to that great incarnate representative of this age,
St.[Decoration]

XXIV._THE ENROBING OF LIBERTY._


    The war-drum was silent, the cannon was mute,
      The sword in its scabbard lay still,
    And battle had gathered the last autumn fruit
      That crimson-dyed river and rill,
    When a Goddess came down from her mansion on high,
      To gladden the world with her smile,
    Leaving only her robes in the realm of the sky,
      That their sheen might no mortal beguile.As she lit on the earth she was welcomed by Peace,
      Twin sisters in Eden of yore--
    But parted forever when fetter-bound Greece
      Drove her exiled and chained from her shore;
    Never since had the angel of Liberty trod
      In virginal beauty below;
    But, chased from the earth, she had mounted to God,
      Despoiled of her raiment of snow.Our sires gathered round her, entranced by her smile,
      Remembering the footprints of old
    She had graven on grottoes, in Scio's sweet Isle,
      Ere the doom of fair Athens was told."I am naked," she cried; "I am homeless on earth;
      Kings, Princes, and Lords are my foes,
    But I stand undismayed, though an orphan by birth,
      And condemned to the region of snows."hail"--our fathers exclaim--
      "To the glorious land of the West!With a diadem bright we will honor thy name,
      And enthrone thee America's guest;
    We will found a great nation and call it thine own,
      And erect here an altar to thee,
    Where millions shall kneel at the foot of thy throne
      And swear to forever be free!"Then each brought a vestment her form to enrobe,
      And screen her fair face from the sun,
    And thus she stood forth as the Queen of the globe
      When the work of our Fathers was done.A circlet of stars round her temples they wove,
      That gleamed like Orion's bright band,
    And an emblem of power, the eagle of Jove,
      They perched like a bolt in her hand;
    On her forehead, a scroll that contained but a line
      Was written in letters of light,
    That our great "Constitution" forever might shine,
      A sun to illumine the night.Her feet were incased in broad sandals of gold,
      That riches might spring in her train;
    While a warrior's casque, with its visor uproll'd,
      Protected her tresses and brain;
    Round her waist a bright girdle of satin was bound,
      Formed of colors so blended and true,
    That when as a banner the scarf was unwound,
      It floated the "Red, White and Blue."Then Liberty calm, leant on Washington's arm,
      And spoke in prophetical strain:
    "Columbia's proud hills I will shelter from ills,
      Whilst her valleys and mountains remain;
    But palsied the hand that would pillage the band
      Of sisterhood stars in my crown,
    And death to the knave whose sword would enslave,
      By striking your great charter down."Your eagle shall soar this western world o'er,
      And carry the sound of my name,
    Till monarchs shall quake and its confines forsake,
      If true to your ancestral fame!Your banner shall gleam like the polar star's beam,
      To guide through rebellion's Red sea,
    And in battle 'twill wave, both to conquer and save,
      If borne by the hands of the free!"[Decoration]

XXV._A CAKE OF SOAP._


    I stood at my washstand, one bright sunny morn,
    And gazed through the blinds at the upbringing corn,
    And mourn'd that my summers were passing away,
    Like the dew on the meadow that morning in May.I seized, for an instant, the Iris-hued soap,
    That glowed in the dish, like an emblem of hope,
    And said to myself, as I melted its snows,
    "The longer I use it, the lesser it grows."For life, in its morn, is full freighted and gay,
    And fair as the rainbow when clouds float away;
    Sweet-scented and useful, it sheds its perfume,
    Till wasted or blasted, it melts in the tomb.Thus day after day, whilst we lather and scrub,
    Time wasteth and blasteth with many a rub,
    Till thinner and thinner, the soap wears away,
    And age hands us over to dust and decay.as I dream of thee now,
    With the spice in thy breath, and the bloom on thy brow,
    To a cake of pure Lubin thy life I compare,
    So fragrant, so fragile, and so debonair!But fortune was fickle, and labor was vain,
    And want overtook us, with grief in its train,
    Till, worn out by troubles, death came in the blast;
    But _thy_ kisses, like Lubin's, were sweet to the last!_THE SUMMERFIELD CASE._


The following additional particulars, as sequel to the Summerfield
homicide, have been furnished by an Auburn correspondent:

  MR.EDITOR: The remarkable confession of the late Leonidas Parker,
  which appeared in your issue of the 13th ultimo, has given rise to
  a series of disturbances in this neighborhood, which, for romantic
  interest and downright depravity, have seldom been surpassed, even
  in California.Before proceeding to relate in detail the late
  transactions, allow me to remark that the wonderful narrative of
  Parker excited throughout this county sentiments of the most
  profound and contradictory character.I, for one, halted between
  two opinions--horror and incredulity; and nothing but subsequent
  events could have fully satisfied me of the unquestionable
  veracity of your San Francisco correspondent, and the scientific
  authenticity of the facts related.The doubt with which the story was at first received in this
  community--and which found utterance in a burlesque article in an
  obscure country journal, the Stars and Stripes, of Auburn--has
  finally been dispelled and we find ourselves forced to admit that
  we stand even now in the presence of the most alarming fate.Too
  much credit cannot be awarded to our worthy coroner for the
  promptitude of his action, and we trust that the Governor of the
  State will not be less efficient in the discharge of his duty.[Since the above letter was written the following proclamation has
  been issued.--P.PROCLAMATION OF THE GOVERNOR.=$10,000 REWARD!=

                                           DEPARTMENT OF STATE.By virtue of the authority in me vested, I do hereby offer the
    above reward of ten thousand dollars, in gold coin of the
    United States, for the Arrest of Bartholomew Graham,
    familiarly known as Black Bart.Said Graham is accused of the
    murder of C. P. Gillson, late of Auburn, county of Placer, on
    the 14th ultimo.He is five feet ten inches and a half in
    height, thick set, has a mustache sprinkled with gray,
    grizzled hair, clear blue eyes, walks stooping, and served in
    the late civil war under Price and Quantrell, in the
    Confederate army.He may be lurking in some of the
    mining-camps near the foot-hills, as he was a Washoe teamster
    during the Comstock excitement.The above reward will be paid
    for him, _dead or alive_, as he possessed himself of an
    important secret by robbing the body of the late Gregory
    Summerfield.By the Governor:                  H. G. NICHOLSON,
                                            Secretary of State.Given at Sacramento, this the fifth day of June, 1871.Our correspondent continues:

  I am sorry to say that Sheriff Higgins has not been so active in
  the discharge of his duty as the urgency of the case required, but
  he is perhaps excusable on account of the criminal interference of
  the editor above alluded to.But I am detaining you from more
  important matters.Your Saturday's paper reached here at 4
  o'clock, Saturday, 13th May, and, as it now appears from the
  evidence taken before the coroner, several persons left Auburn on
  the same errand, but without any previous conference.Two of these
  were named respectively Charles P. Gillson and Bartholomew Graham,
  or, as he was usually called, "Black Bart."Gillson kept a saloon
  at the corner of Prickly Ash Street and the Old Spring Road; and
  Black Bart was in the employ of Conrad & Co., keepers of the
  Norfolk livery stable.Gillson was a son-in-law of ex-Governor
  Roberts, of Iowa, and leaves a wife and two children to mourn his
  untimely end.As for Graham, nothing certain is known of his
  antecedents.It is said that he was engaged in the late robbery of
  Wells & Fargo's express at Grizzly Bend, and that he was an
  habitual gambler.Only one thing about him is certainly well
  known: he was a lieutenant in the Confederate army, and served
  under General Price and the outlaw Quantrell.He was a man
  originally of fine education, plausible manners and good family;
  but strong drink seems early in life to have overmastered him, and
  left him but a wreck of himself.But he was not incapable of
  generous, or rather, romantic, acts; for, during the burning of
  the Putnam House, in this town, last summer, he rescued two ladies
  from the flames.In so doing he scorched his left hand so
  seriously as to contract the tendons of two fingers, and this very
  scar may lead to his apprehension.There is no doubt about his
  utter desperation of character, and, if taken at all, it will
  probably be not alive.So much for the persons concerned in the tragedy at the Flat.Herewith I inclose copies of the testimony of the witnesses
  examined before the coroner's jury, together with the statement of
  Gillson, taken _in articulo mortis_:


                     DEPOSITION OF DOLLIE ADAMS.STATE OF CALIFORNIA, } ss.Said witness, being duly sworn, deposed as follows, to wit: My
    name is Dollie Adams; my age forty-seven years; I am the wife
    of Frank G. Adams, of this township, and reside on the North
    Fork of the American River, below Cape Horn, on Thompson's
    Flat; about one o'clock P. M., May 14, 1871, I left the cabin
    to gather wood to cook dinner for my husband and the hands at
    work for him on the claim; the trees are mostly cut away from
    the bottom, and I had to climb some distance up the mountain
    side before I could get enough to kindle the fire; I had gone
    about five hundred yards from the cabin, and was searching for
    small sticks of fallen timber, when I thought I heard some one
    groan, as if in pain; I paused and listened; the groaning
    became more distinct, and I started at once for the place
    whence the sounds proceeded; about ten steps off I discovered
    the man whose remains lie there (pointing to the deceased),
    sitting up, with his back against a big rock; he looked so
    pale that I thought him already dead, but he continued to moan
    until I reached his side; hearing me approach, he opened his
    eyes, and begged me, "For God's sake, give me a drop of
    water!"I asked him, "What is the matter?"He replied, "I am
    shot in the back."Without waiting to question him further, I returned
    to the cabin, told Zenie--my daughter--what I had seen, and
    sent her off on a run for the men.Taking with me a gourd of
    water, some milk and bread--for I thought the poor gentleman
    might be hungry and weak, as well as wounded--I hurried back
    to his side, where I remained until "father"--as we all call
    my husband--came with the men.We removed him as gently as we
    could to the cabin; then sent for Dr.Liebner, and nursed him
    until he died, yesterday, just at sunset.Question by the Coroner: Did you hear his statement, taken
    down by the Assistant District Attorney?--A.Q. Did you see him sign it?--A.Q. Is this your signature thereto as witness?--A.(Signed)                         DOLLIE ADAMS.DEPOSITION OF MISS X. V. ADAMS.Being first duly sworn, witness testified as follows: My name
    is Xixenia Volumnia Adams; I am the daughter of Frank G. Adams
    and the last witness; I reside with them on the Flat, and my
    age is eighteen years; a little past 1 o'clock on Sunday last
    my mother came running into the house and informed me that a
    man was dying from a wound, on the side-hill, and that I must
    go for father and the boys immediately.I ran as fast as my
    legs would carry me to where they were "cleaning up," for they
    never cleaned up week-days on the Flat, and told the news; we
    all came back together and proceeded to the spot where the
    wounded man lay weltering in his blood; he was cautiously
    removed to the cabin, where he lingered until yesterday
    sundown, when he died.A. He did
    frequently; at first with great pain, but afterward more
    audibly and intelligibly.A. First, to send for Squire Jacobs, the
    Assistant District Attorney, as he had a statement to make;
    and some time afterward, to send for his wife; but we first of
    all sent for the doctor.A. Only myself; he had
    appeared a great deal easier, and his wife had lain down to
    take a short nap, and my mother had gone to the spring and
    left me alone to watch; suddenly he lifted himself
    spasmodically in bed, glared around wildly and muttered
    something inaudible; seeing me, he cried out, "Run!or he'll set
    the world afire!His tone of voice
    gradually strengthened until the end of his raving; when he
    cried "fire!"his eyeballs glared, his mouth quivered, his
    body convulsed, and before Mrs.Gillson could reach his
    bedside he fell back stone dead.(Signed)                          X. V. ADAMS.The testimony of Adams corroborated in every particular that of
  his wife and daughter, but set forth more fully the particulars of
  his demoniac ravings.He would taste nothing from a glass or
  bottle, but shuddered whenever any article of that sort met his
  eyes.In fact, they had to remove from the room the cups,
  tumblers, and even the castors.At times he spoke rationally, but
  after the second day only in momentary flashes of sanity.The deposition of the attending physician, after giving the
  general facts with regard to the sickness of the patient and his
  subsequent demise, proceeded thus:


    I found the patient weak, and suffering from loss of blood and
    rest, and want of nourishment; occasionally sane, but for the
    most part flighty and in a comatose condition.The wound was
    an ordinary gunshot wound, produced most probably by the ball
    of a navy revolver, fired at the distance of ten paces.It
    entered the back near the left clavicle, beneath the scapula,
    close to the vertebrae between the intercostal spaces of the
    fifth and sixth ribs; grazing the pericardium it traversed the
    mediastinum, barely touching the oesophagus, and vena azygos,
    but completely severing the thoracic duct, and lodging in the
    xiphoid portion of the sternum.Necessarily fatal, there was
    no reason, however, why the patient could not linger for a
    week or more; but it is no less certain that from the effect
    of the wound he ultimately died.I witnessed the execution of
    the paper shown to me--as the statement of deceased--at his
    request; and at the time of signing the same he was in his
    perfect senses.It was taken down in my presence by Jacobs,
    the Assistant District Attorney of Placer County, and read
    over to the deceased before he affixed his signature.I was
    not present when he breathed his last, having been called away
    by my patients in the town of Auburn, but I reached his
    bedside shortly afterward.In my judgment, no amount of care
    or medical attention could have prolonged his life more than a
    few days.(Signed)                   KARL LIEBNER, M. D.


  The statement of the deceased was then introduced to the jury as
  follows:


    PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA }
                  _vs._               }
            BARTHOLOMEW GRAHAM.       }_Statement and Dying Confession of Charles P. Gillson, taken
    in articulo mortis by George Simpson, Notary Public._

    On the morning of Sunday, the 14th day of May, 1871, I left
    Auburn alone in search of the body of the late Gregory
    Summerfield, who was reported to have been pushed from the
    cars at Cape Horn, in this county, by one Leonidas Parker,
    since deceased.It was not fully light when I reached the
    track of the Central Pacific Railroad.Having mined at an
    early day on Thompson's Flat, at the foot of the rocky
    promontory now called Cape Horn, I was familiar with the
    zigzag paths leading down that steep precipice.One was
    generally used as a descent, the other as an ascent from the
    canyon below.I chose the latter, as being the freest from the
    chance of observation.It required the greatest caution to
    thread the narrow gorge; but I finally reached the rocky
    bench, about one thousand feet below the grade of the
    railroad.It was now broad daylight, and I commenced
    cautiously the search for Summerfield's body.There is quite a
    dense undergrowth of shrubs thereabouts, lining the
    interstices of the granite rocks so as to obscure the vision
    even at a short distance.Brushing aside a thick manzanita
    bush, I beheld the dead man at the same instant of time that
    another person arrived like an apparition upon the spot.It
    was Bartholomew Graham, known as "Black Bart."We suddenly
    confronted each other, the skeleton of Summerfield lying
    exactly between us.Graham
    advanced and I did the same; he stretched out his hand and we
    greeted one another across the prostrate corpse.Before releasing my hand, Black Bart exclaimed in a hoarse
    whisper, "Swear, Gillson, in the presence of the dead, that
    you will forever be faithful, never betray me, and do exactly
    as I bid you, as long as you live!"Fate sat there, cold and
    remorseless as stone.I hesitated; with his left hand he
    slightly raised the lappels of his coat, and grasped the
    handle of a navy revolver.As I gazed, his eyeballs assumed a greenish tint, and his
    brow darkened into a scowl."As your confederate," I answered,
    "never as your slave."The body was lying upon its back, with the face upwards.The
    vultures had despoiled the countenance of every vestige of
    flesh, and left the sockets of the eyes empty.Snow and ice
    and rain had done their work effectually upon the exposed
    surfaces of his clothing, and the eagles had feasted upon the
    entrails.But underneath, the thick beaver cloth had served to
    protect the flesh, and there were some decaying shreds left of
    what had once been the terrible but accomplished Gregory
    Summerfield.But they did
    not interest me so much as another spectacle, that almost
    froze my blood.In the skeleton gripe of the right hand,
    interlaced within the clenched bones, gleamed the wide-mouthed
    vial which was the object of our mutual visit.Graham fell
    upon his knees, and attempted to withdraw the prize from the
    grasp of its dead possessor.But the bones were firm, and when
    he finally succeeded in securing the bottle, by a sudden
    wrench, I heard the skeleton fingers snap like pipe-stems."Hold this a moment, whilst I search the pockets," he
    commanded.He then turned over the corpse, and thrusting his hand into
    the inner breast-pocket, dragged out a roll of MSS., matted
    closely together and stained by the winter's rains.A further
    search eventuated in finding a roll of small gold coin, a set
    of deringer pistols, a mated double-edged dirk, and a pair of
    silver-mounted spectacles.Hastily covering over the body with
    leaves and branches cut from the embowering shrubs, we
    shudderingly left the spot.We slowly descended the gorge toward the banks of the American
    River, until we arrived in a small but sequestered thicket,
    where we threw ourselves upon the ground.Neither had spoken a
    word since we left the scene above described.Graham was the
    first to break the silence which to me had become oppressive."Let us examine the vial and see if the contents are safe."I drew it forth from my pocket and handed it to him."Sealed hermetically, and perfectly secure," he added.Saying
    this he deliberately wrapped it up in a handkerchief and
    placed it in his bosom.As he said this he laughed derisively, and cut
    a most scornful and threatening glance toward me."Yes," I rejoined firmly; "_our_ prize!""Gillson," retorted Graham, "you must regard me as a
    consummate simpleton, or yourself a Goliah.This bottle is
    mine, and _mine_ only.It is a great fortune for _one_, but of
    less value than a toadstool for _two_.I am willing to divide
    fairly.This secret would be of no service to a coward.He
    would not dare to use it.Your share of the robbery of the
    body shall be these MSS.; you can sell them to some poor devil
    of a printer, and pay yourself for your day's work."Saying this he threw the bundle of MSS.at my feet; but I
    disdained to touch them.Observing this, he gathered them up
    safely and replaced them in his pocket."As you are unarmed,"
    he said, "it would not be safe for you to be seen in this
    neighborhood during daylight.We will both spend the night
    here, and just before morning return to Auburn.I will
    accompany you part of the distance."With the _sangfroid_ of a perfect desperado, he then stretched
    himself out in the shadow of a small tree, drank deeply from a
    whisky flagon which he produced, and pulling his hat over his
    eyes, was soon asleep and snoring.It was a long time before I
    could believe the evidence of my own senses.Finally, I
    approached the ruffian, and placed my hand on his shoulder.He
    did not stir a muscle.I listened; I heard only the deep, slow
    breathing of profound slumber.Resolved not to be balked and
    defrauded by such a scoundrel, I stealthily withdrew the vial
    from his pocket, and sprang to my feet, just in time to hear
    the click of a revolver behind me.I remember
    only a dash and an explosion--a deathly sensation, a whirl of
    the rocks and trees about me, a hideous imprecation from the
    lips of my murderer, and I fell senseless to the earth.When I
    awoke to consciousness it was past midnight.I looked up at
    the stars, and recognized Lyra shining full in my face.That
    constellation I knew passed the meridian at this season of the
    year after twelve o'clock, and its slow march told me that
    many weary hours would intervene before daylight.My right arm
    was paralyzed, but I put forth my left, and it rested in a
    pool of my own blood.I
    exclaimed, faintly; but only the low sighing of the night
    blast responded.Shortly after daylight I
    revived, and crawled to the spot where I was discovered on the
    next day by the kind mistress of this cabin.I accuse Bartholomew Graham of my assassination.I do
    this in the perfect possession of my senses, and with a full
    sense of my responsibility to Almighty God.(Signed)                        C. P. GILLSON.GEORGE SIMPSON, Notary Public.KARL LIEBNER,}

  of MSS.which had been thrown in at the transom over the door,
  labeled, "The Summerfield MSS."Attached to them was an unsealed
  note from one Bartholomew Graham, in these words:

    DEAR SIR: These are yours: you have earned them.I commend
    to your especial notice the one styled "_De Mundo Comburendo_."At a future time you may hear again from

                                            BARTHOLOMEW GRAHAM.A casual glance at the papers convinces me that they are of great
  literary value.Summerfield's fame never burned so brightly as it
  does over this grave.[Decoration]

XXVII._THE AVITOR._


    Hurrah for the wings that never tire--
      For the nerves that never quail;
    For the heart that beats in a bosom of fire--
    For the lungs whose cast-iron lobes respire
      Where the eagle's breath would fail!As the genii bore Aladdin away,
      In search of his palace fair,
    On his magical wings to the land of Cathay,
    So here I will spread out my pinions to-day
      On the cloud-borne billows of air.to its home on the mountain crag,
      Where the condor builds its nest,
    I mount far fleeter than hunted stag,
    I float far higher than Switzer flag--
      Hurrah for the lightning's guest!Away, over steeple and cross and tower--
      Away, over river and sea;
    I spurn at my feet the tempests that lower,
    Like minions base of a vanquished power,
      And mutter their thunders at me!Diablo frowns, as above him I pass,
      Still loftier heights to attain;
    Calaveras' groves are but blades of grass--
    Yosemite's sentinel peaks a mass
      Of ant-hills dotting a plain!Sierra Nevada's shroud of snow,
      And Utah's desert of sand,
    Shall never again turn backward the flow
    Of that human tide which may come and go
      To the vales of the sunset land!Wherever the coy earth veils her face
      With tresses of forest hair;
    Where polar pallors her blushes efface,
    Or tropical blooms lend her beauty and grace--
      I can flutter my plumage there!Where the Amazon rolls through a mystical land--
      Where Chiapas buried her dead--
    Where Central Australian deserts expand--
    Where Africa seethes in saharas of sand--
      Even there shall my pinions spread!No longer shall earth with her secrets beguile,
      For I, with undazzled eyes,
    Will trace to their sources the Niger and Nile,
    And stand without dread on the boreal isle,
      The Colon of the skies!Then hurrah for the wings that never tire--
      For the sinews that never quail;
    For the heart that throbs in a bosom of fire--
    For the lungs whose cast-iron lobes respire
      When the eagle's breath would fail![Decoration]


XXVIII._LOST AND FOUND._


    'Twas eventide in Eden.The mortals stood,
    Watchful and solemn, in speechless sorrow bound.He was erect, defiant, and unblenched.Tho' fallen, free--deceived, but not undone.She leaned on him, and drooped her pensive brow
    In token of the character she bore--
    _The world's first penitent_.Tears, gushing fast,
    Streamed from her azure eyes; and as they fled
    Beyond the eastern gate, where gleamed the swords
    Of guarding Cherubim, the flowers themselves
    Bent their sad heads, surcharged with dewy tears,
    Wept by the stare o'er man's immortal woe.Far had they wandered, slow had been the pace,
    Grief at his heart and ruin on her face,
    Ere Adam turned to contemplate the spot
    Where Earth began, where Heaven was forgot.He gazed in silence, till the crystal wall
    Of Eden trembled, as though doomed to fall:
    Then bidding Eve direct her tear-dimmed eye
    To where the foliage kissed the western sky,
    They saw, with horror mingled with surprise,
    The wall, the garden, and the foliage rise!Slowly it mounted to the vaulted dome,
    And paused as if to beckon mortals home;
    Then, like a cloud when winds are all at rest,
    It floated gently to the distant west,
    And left behind a crimson path of light,
    By which to track the Garden in its flight!Day after day, the exiles wandered on,
    With eyes still fixed, where Eden's smile last shone;
    Forlorn and friendless through the wilds they trod,
    Remembering Eden, but forgetting God,
    Till far across the sea-washed, arid plain,
    The billows thundered that the search was vain!who can tell how oft at eventide,
    When the gay west was blushing like a bride,
    Fair Eve hath whispered in her children's ear,
    "Beyond yon cloud will Eden reappear!"And thus, as slow millenniums rolled away,
    Each generation, ere it turned to clay,
    Has with prophetic lore, by nature blest,
    In search of Eden wandered to the West.I cast my thoughts far up the stream of time,
    And catch its murmurs in my careless rhyme.I hear a footstep tripping o'er the down:
    Behold!In fancy now her splendors reappear;
    Her fleets and phalanxes, her shield and spear;
    Her battle-fields, blest ever by the free,--
    Proud Marathon, and sad Thermopylae!Her poet, foremost in the ranks of fame,
    Homer!a god--but with a mortal's name;
    Historians, richest in primeval lore;
    Orations, sounding yet from shore to shore!Heroes and statesmen throng the enraptured gaze,
    Till glory totters 'neath her load of praise.Surely a clime so rich in old renown
    Could build an Eden, if not woo one down!Plato comes, with wisdom's scroll unfurl'd,
    The proudest gift of Athens to the world!Wisest of mortals, say, for thou can'st tell,
    Thou, whose sweet lips the Muses loved so well,
    Was Greece the Garden that our fathers trod;
    When men, like angels, walked the earth with God?the great Philosopher replied,
    "Though I love Athens better than a bride,
    Her laws are bloody and her children slaves;
    Her sages slumber in empoisoned graves;
    Her soil is sterile, barren are her seas;
    Eden still blooms in the Hesperides,
    Beyond the pillars of far Hercules!Westward, amid the ocean's blandest smile,
    Atlantis blossoms, a perennial Isle;
    A vast Republic stretching far and wide,
    Greater than Greece and Macedon beside!"Across the mental screen
    A mightier spirit stalks upon the scene;
    His tread shakes empires ancient as the sun;
    His voice resounds, and nations are undone;
    War in his tone and battle in his eye,
    The world in arms, a Roman dare defy!Throned on the summit of the seven hills,
    He bathes his gory heel in Tiber's rills;
    Stretches his arms across a triple zone,
    And dares be master of mankind, alone!All peoples send their tribute to his store;
    Wherever rivers glide or surges roar,
    Or mountains rise or desert plains expand,
    His minions sack and pillage every land.But not alone for rapine and for war
    The Roman eagle spreads his pinions far;
    He bears a sceptre in his talons strong,
    To guard the right, to rectify the wrong,
    And carries high, in his imperial beak,
    A shield armored to protect the weak.Justice and law are dropping from his wing,
    Equal alike for consul, serf or king;
    Daggers for tyrants, for patriot-heroes fame,
    Attend like menials on the Roman name!Was Rome the Eden of our ancient state,
    Just in her laws, in her dominion great,
    Wise in her counsels, matchless in her worth,
    Acknowledged great proconsul of the earth?An eye prophetic that has read the leaves
    The sibyls scattered from their loosened sheaves,
    A bard that sang at Rome in all her pride,
    Shall give response;--let Seneca decide!"Beyond the rocks where Shetland's breakers roar,
    And clothe in foam the wailing, ice-bound shore,
    Within the bosom of a tranquil sea,
    Where Earth has reared her _Ultima Thule_,
    The gorgeous West conceals a golden clime,
    The petted child, the paragon of Time!In distant years, when Ocean's mountain wave
    Shall rock a cradle, not upheave a grave,
    When men shall walk the pathway of the brine,
    With feet as safe as Terra watches mine,
    Then shall the barriers of the Western Sea
    Despised and broken down forever be;
    Then man shall spurn old Ocean's loftiest crest,
    And tear the secret from his stormy breast!"Night settles down
    And shrouds the world in black Plutonian frown;
    Earth staggers on, like mourners to a tomb,
    Wrapt in one long millennium of gloom.That past, the light breaks through the clouds of war,
    And drives the mists of Bigotry afar;
    Amalfi sees her burial tomes unfurl'd,
    And dead Justinian rules again the world.The torch of Science is illumed once more;
    Adventure gazes from the surf-beat shore,
    Lifts in his arms the wave-worn Genoese,
    And hails Iberia, Mistress of the Seas!What cry resounds along the Western main,
    Mounts to the stars, is echoed back again,
    And wakes the voices of the startled sea,
    Dumb until now, from past eternity?is chanted from the Pinta's deck;
    Smiling afar, a minute glory-speck,
    But grandly rising from the convex sea,
    To crown Colon with immortality,
    The Western World emerges from the wave,
    God's last asylum for the free and brave!But where within this ocean-bounded clime,
    This fairest offspring of the womb of time,--
    Plato's Atlantis, risen from the sea,
    Utopia's realm, beyond old Rome's Thule,--
    Where shall we find, within this giant land,
    By blood redeemed, with Freedom's rainbow spann'd,
    The spot first trod by mortals on the earth,
    Where Adam's race was cradled into birth?'Twas sought by Cortez with his warrior band,
    In realms once ruled by Montezuma's hand;
    Where the old Aztec, 'neath his hills of snow,
    Built the bright domes of silver Mexico.Pizarro sought it where the Inca's rod
    Proclaimed the prince half-mortal, demi-god,
    When the mild children of unblest Peru
    Before the bloodhounds of the conqueror flew,
    And saw their country and their race undone,
    And perish 'neath the Temple of the Sun!De Soto sought it, with his tawny bride,
    Near where the Mississippi's waters glide,
    Beneath the ripples of whose yellow wave
    He found at last both monument and grave.Old Ponce de Leon, in the land of flowers,
    Searched long for Eden'midst her groves and bowers,
    Whilst brave La Salle, where Texan prairies smile,
    Roamed westward still, to reach the happy isle.The Pilgrim Fathers on the Mayflower's deck,
    Fleeing beyond a tyrant's haughty beck,
    In quest of Eden, trod the rock-bound shore,
    Where bleak New England's wintry surges roar;
    Raleigh, with glory in his eagle eye,
    Chased the lost realm beneath a Southern sky;
    Whilst Boone believed that Paradise was found
    In old Kentucky's "dark and bloody ground!"In vain their labors, all in vain their toil;
    Doomed ne'er to breathe that air nor tread that soil.Heaven had reserved it till a race sublime
    Should launch its heroes on the wave of time!Go with me now, ye Californian band,
    And gaze with wonder at your glorious land;
    Ascend the summit of yon middle chain,
    When Mount Diablo rises from the plain,
    And cast your eyes with telescopic power,
    O'er hill and forest, over field and flower.how free the hand of God hath roll'd
    A wave of wealth across your Land of Gold!The mountains ooze it from their swelling breast,
    The milk-white quartz displays it in her crest;
    Each tiny brook that warbles to the sea,
    Harps on its strings a golden melody;
    Whilst the young waves are cradled on the shore
    On spangling pillows, stuffed with golden ore!See the Sacramento glide
    Through valleys blooming like a royal bride,
    And bearing onward to the ocean's shore
    A richer freight than Arno ever bore!also fanned by cool refreshing gales,
    Fair Petaluma and her sister vales,
    Whose fields and orchards ornament the plain
    And deluge earth with one vast sea of grain!Santa Clara smiles afar,
    As in the fields of heaven, a radiant star;
    Los Angeles is laughing through her vines;
    Old Monterey sits moody midst her pines;
    Far San Diego flames her golden bow,
    And Santa Barbara sheds her fleece of snow,
    Whilst Bernardino's ever-vernal down
    Gleams like an emerald in a monarch's crown!On the plains of San Joaquin
    Ten thousand herds in dense array are seen.Aloft like columns propping up the skies
    The cloud-kissed groves of Calaveras rise;
    Whilst dashing downward from their dizzy home
    The thundering falls of Yo Semite foam!Opening on an ocean great,
    Behold the portal of the Golden Gate!Pillared on granite, destined e'er to stand
    The iron rampart of the sunset land!With rosy cheeks, fanned by the fresh sea-breeze,
    The petted child of the Pacific seas,
    See San Francisco smile!Majestic heir
    Of all that's brave, or bountiful, or fair,
    Pride of our land, by every wave carest,
    And hailed by nations, Venice of the West!why should I tell,
    What every eye and bosom know so well?Why thy name the land all other lands have blest,
    And traced for ages to the distant West?Why search in vain throughout th' historic page
    For Eden's garden and the Golden Age?NO FURTHER LET US ROAM;
    THIS IS THE GARDEN![Decoration]

number signs (#) appears.I forgot--the Highland loon is far beyond Fortingall.Patience, daughter, I will presently bring you news.""Ye need not hurry yourself for that, Simon Glover," quoth the obdurate
old woman; "the best and the worst of it may be tauld before you could
hobble over your door stane.I ken the haill story abroad; 'for,'
thought I, 'our goodman is so wilful that he'll be for banging out to
the tuilzie, be the cause what it like; and sae I maun e'en stir my
shanks, and learn the cause of all this, or he will hae his auld nose in
the midst of it, and maybe get it nipt off before he knows what for.'""And what is the news, then, old woman?"said the impatient glover,
still busying himself with the hundred points or latchets which were the
means of attaching the doublet to the hose.Dorothy suffered him to proceed in his task till she conjectured it must
be nearly accomplished; and foresaw that; if she told not the secret
herself, her master would be abroad to seek in person for the cause of
the disturbance.She, therefore, halloo'd out: "Aweel--aweel, ye canna
say it is me fault, if you hear ill news before you have been at
the morning mass.I would have kept it from ye till ye had heard the
priest's word; but since you must hear it, you have e'en lost the truest
friend that ever gave hand to another, and Perth maun mourn for the
bravest burgher that ever took a blade in hand!"exclaimed the father and the daughter at
once."Oh, ay, there ye hae it at last," said Dorothy; "and whose fault was it
but your ain?ye made such a piece of work about his companying with a
glee woman, as if he had companied with a Jewess!"Dorothy would have gone on long enough, but her master exclaimed to
his daughter, who was still in her own apartment: "It is nonsense,
Catharine--all the dotage of an old fool.I will bring you the true tidings in a moment," and snatching up his
staff, the old man hurried out past Dorothy and into the street, where
the throng of people were rushing towards the High Street.Dorothy, in the mean time, kept muttering to herself: "Thy father is a
wise man, take his ain word for it.He will come next by some scathe
in the hobbleshow, and then it will be, 'Dorothy, get the lint,' and
'Dorothy, spread the plaster;' but now it is nothing but nonsense, and
a lie, and impossibility, that can come out of Dorothy's mouth.Does auld Simon think that Harry Smith's head was as hard as
his stithy, and a haill clan of Highlandmen dinging at him?"Here she was interrupted by a figure like an angel, who came wandering
by her with wild eye, cheek deadly pale, hair dishevelled, and an
apparent want of consciousness, which terrified the old woman out of her
discontented humour."Did you not say some one was dead?"said Catharine, with a frightful
uncertainty of utterance, as if her organs of speech and hearing served
her but imperfectly.Ay--ay, dead eneugh; ye'll no hae him to gloom at ony
mair."repeated Catharine, still with the same uncertainty of voice and
manner."Dead--slain--and by Highlanders?""I'se warrant by Highlanders, the lawless loons.Wha is it else that
kills maist of the folks about, unless now and than when the burghers
take a tirrivie, and kill ane another, or whiles that the knights and
nobles shed blood?But I'se uphauld it's been the Highlandmen this bout.The man was no in Perth, laird or loon, durst have faced Henry Smith
man to man.There's been sair odds against him; ye'll see that when it's
looked into."repeated Catharine, as if haunted by some idea which
troubled her senses.Oh, Conachar--Conachar!""Indeed, and I dare say you have lighted on the very man, Catharine.They quarrelled, as you saw, on the St.Valentine's Even, and had a
warstle.A Highlandman has a long memory for the like of that.Gie him
a cuff at Martinmas, and his cheek will be tingling at Whitsunday.But
what could have brought down the lang legged loons to do their bloody
wark within burgh?""Woe's me, it was I," said Catharine--"it was I brought the Highlanders
down--I that sent for Conachar--ay, they have lain in wait--but it was I
that brought them within reach of their prey.But I will see with my own
eyes--and then--something we will do.Say to my father I will be back
anon."shouted Dorothy, as Catharine made past her
towards the street door."You would not gang into the street with the
hair hanging down your haffets in that guise, and you kenn'd for the
Fair Maid of Perth?Mass, but she's out in the street, come o't what
like, and the auld Glover will be as mad as if I could withhold her,
will she nill she, flyte she fling she.This is a brave morning for an
Ash Wednesday!If I were to seek my master among the
multitude, I were like to be crushed beneath their feet, and little moan
made for the old woman.And am I to run after Catharine, who ere this is
out of sight, and far lighter of foot than I am?so I will just down the
gate to Nicol Barber's, and tell him a' about it."While the trusty Dorothy was putting her prudent resolve into execution,
Catharine ran through the streets of Perth in a manner which at another
moment would have brought on her the attention of every one who saw her
hurrying on with a reckless impetuosity wildly and widely different from
the ordinary decency and composure of her step and manner, and without
the plaid, scarf, or mantle which "women of good," of fair character
and decent rank, universally carried around them, when they went abroad.But, distracted as the people were, every one inquiring or telling
the cause of the tumult, and most recounting it different ways,
the negligence of her dress and discomposure of her manner made no
impression on any one; and she was suffered to press forward on the path
she had chosen without attracting more notice than the other females
who, stirred by anxious curiosity or fear, had come out to inquire the
cause of an alarm so general--it might be to seek for friends for whose
safety they were interested.As Catharine passed along, she felt all the wild influence of the
agitating scene, and it was with difficulty she forbore from repeating
the cries of lamentation and alarm which were echoed around her.In the
mean time, she rushed rapidly on, embarrassed like one in a dream, with
a strange sense of dreadful calamity, the precise nature of which she
was unable to define, but which implied the terrible consciousness that
the man who loved her so fondly, whose good qualities she so highly
esteemed, and whom she now felt to be dearer than perhaps she would
before have acknowledged to her own bosom, was murdered, and most
probably by her means.The connexion betwixt Henry's supposed death and
the descent of Conachar and his followers, though adopted by her in a
moment of extreme and engrossing emotion, was sufficiently probable
to have been received for truth, even if her understanding had been
at leisure to examine its credibility.Without knowing what she sought
except the general desire to know the worst of the dreadful report, she
hurried forward to the very spot which of all others her feelings of the
preceding day would have induced her to avoid.Who would, upon the evening of Shrovetide, have persuaded the proud, the
timid, the shy, the rigidly decorous Catharine Glover that before mass
on Ash Wednesday she should rush through the streets of Perth, making
her way amidst tumult and confusion, with her hair unbound and her dress
disarranged, to seek the house of that same lover who, she had reason to
believe, had so grossly and indelicately neglected and affronted her as
to pursue a low and licentious amour?Yet so it was; and her eagerness
taking, as if by instinct, the road which was most free, she avoided the
High Street, where the pressure was greatest, and reached the wynd by
the narrow lanes on the northern skirt of the town, through which Henry
Smith had formerly escorted Louise.But even these comparatively lonely
passages were now astir with passengers, so general was the alarm.Catharine Glover made her way through them, however, while such as
observed her looked on each other and shook their heads in sympathy with
her distress.At length, without any distinct idea of her own purpose,
she stood before her lover's door and knocked for admittance.The silence which succeeded the echoing of her hasty summons increased
the alarm which had induced her to take this desperate measure.Open, if you
would not find Catharine Glover dead upon your threshold!"As she cried thus frantically to ears which she was taught to believe
were stopped by death, the lover she invoked opened the door in person,
just in time to prevent her sinking on the ground.The extremity of his
ecstatic joy upon an occasion so unexpected was qualified only by the
wonder which forbade him to believe it real, and by his alarm at the
closed eyes, half opened and blanched lips, total absence of complexion,
and apparently total cessation of breathing.Henry had remained at home, in spite of the general alarm, which had
reached his ears for a considerable time, fully determined to put
himself in the way of no brawls that he could avoid; and it was only in
compliance with a summons from the magistrates, which, as a burgher, he
was bound to obey, that, taking his sword and a spare buckler from the
wall, he was about to go forth, for the first time unwillingly, to pay
his service, as his tenure bound him."It is hard," he said, "to be put forward in all the town feuds, when
the fighting work is so detestable to Catharine.I am sure there are
enough of wenches in Perth that say to their gallants, 'Go out, do your
devoir bravely, and win your lady's grace'; and yet they send not for
their lovers, but for me, who cannot do the duties of a man to protect
a minstrel woman, or of a burgess who fights for the honour of his
town, but this peevish Catharine uses me as if I were a brawler and
bordeller!"Such were the thoughts which occupied his mind, when, as he opened his
door to issue forth, the person dearest to his thoughts, but whom he
certainly least expected to see, was present to his eyes, and dropped
into his arms.His mixture of surprise, joy, and anxiety did not deprive him of the
presence of mind which the occasion demanded.To place Catharine
Glover in safety, and recall her to herself was to be thought of
before rendering obedience to the summons of the magistrates, however
pressingly that had been delivered.He carried his lovely burden, as
light as a feather, yet more precious than the same quantity of purest
gold, into a small bedchamber which had been his mother's.It was the
most fit for an invalid, as it looked into the garden, and was separated
from the noise of the tumult."Here, Nurse--Nurse Shoolbred--come quick--come for death and life--here
is one wants thy help!""If it should but prove any one that will keep
thee out of the scuffle," for she also had been aroused by the noise;
but what was her astonishment when, placed in love and reverence on
the bed of her late mistress, and supported by the athletic arms of her
foster son, she saw the apparently lifeless form of the Fair Maid of
Perth.she said; "and, Holy Mother, a dying woman, as it
would seem!""Not so, old woman," said her foster son: "the dear heart throbs--the
sweet breath comes and returns!Come thou, that may aid her more meetly
than I--bring water--essences--whatever thy old skill can devise.Heaven
did not place her in my arms to die, but to live for herself and me!"With an activity which her age little promised, Nurse Shoolbred
collected the means of restoring animation; for, like many women of the
period, she understood what was to be done in such cases, nay, possessed
a knowledge of treating wounds of an ordinary description, which the
warlike propensities of her foster son kept in pretty constant exercise."Come now," she said, "son Henry, unfold your arms from about my
patient, though she is worth the pressing, and set thy hands at freedom
to help me with what I want.Nay, I will not insist on your quitting
her hand, if you will beat the palm gently, as the fingers unclose their
clenched grasp."said Henry; "you were as well bid
me beat a glass cup with a forehammer as tap her fair palm with my horn
hard fingers.But the fingers do unfold, and we will find a better way
than beating"; and he applied his lips to the pretty hand, whose motion
indicated returning sensation.One or two deep sighs succeeded, and
the Fair Maid of Perth opened her eyes, fixed them on her lover, as
he kneeled by the bedside, and again sunk back on the pillow.As she
withdrew not her hand from her lover's hold or from his grasp, we must
in charity believe that the return to consciousness was not so complete
as to make her aware that he abused the advantage, by pressing it
alternately to his lips and his bosom.At the same time we are compelled
to own that the blood was colouring in her cheek, and that her breathing
was deep and regular, for a minute or two during this relapse.The noise at the door began now to grow much louder, and Henry was
called for by all his various names of Smith.Gow, and Hal of the Wynd,
as heathens used to summon their deities by different epithets.At last,
like Portuguese Catholics when exhausted with entreating their saints,
the crowd without had recourse to vituperative exclamations.You are a disgraced man, man sworn to your burgher
oath, and a traitor to the Fair City, unless you come instantly forth!"It would seem that nurse Shoolbred's applications were now so far
successful that Catharine's senses were in some measure restored; for,
turning her face more towards that of her lover than her former posture
permitted, she let her right hand fall on his shoulder, leaving her left
still in his possession, and seeming slightly to detain him, while she
whispered: "Do not go, Henry--stay with me; they will kill thee, these
men of blood."It would seem that this gentle invocation, the result of finding the
lover alive whom she expected to have only recognised as a corpse,
though it was spoken so low as scarcely to be intelligible, had more
effect to keep Henry Wynd in his present posture than the repeated
summons of many voices from without had to bring him downstairs."Mass, townsmen," cried one hardy citizen to his companions, "the saucy
smith but jests with us!Let us into the house, and bring him out by the
lug and the horn.""Take care what you are doing," said a more cautious assailant."The man
that presses on Henry Gow's retirement may go into his house with sound
bones, but will return with ready made work for the surgeon.But here
comes one has good right to do our errand to him, and make the recreant
hear reason on both sides of his head."The person of whom this was spoken was no other than Simon Glover
himself.He had arrived at the fatal spot where the unlucky bonnet
maker's body was lying, just in time to discover, to his great relief,
that when it was turned with the face upwards by Bailie Craigdallie's
orders, the features of the poor braggart Proudfute were recognised,
when the crowd expected to behold those of their favorite champion,
Henry Smith.A laugh, or something approaching to one, went among those
who remembered how hard Oliver had struggled to obtain the character
of a fighting man, however foreign to his nature and disposition, and
remarked now that he had met with a mode of death much better suited
to his pretensions than to his temper.But this tendency to ill timed
mirth, which savoured of the rudeness of the times, was at once hushed
by the voice, and cries, and exclamations of a woman who struggled
through the crowd, screaming at the same time, "Oh, my husband--my
husband!"Room was made for the sorrower, who was followed by two or three female
friends.Maudie Proudfute had been hitherto only noticed as a good
looking, black haired woman, believed to be "dink" and disdainful to
those whom she thought meaner or poorer than herself, and lady and
empress over her late husband, whom she quickly caused to lower his
crest when she chanced to hear him crowing out of season.But now,
under the influence of powerful passion, she assumed a far more imposing
character."Do you laugh," she said, "you unworthy burghers of Perth, because one
of your own citizens has poured his blood into the kennel?or do you
laugh because the deadly lot has lighted on my husband?Did he not maintain an honest house by his own industry,
and keep a creditable board, where the sick had welcome and the poor had
relief?Did he not lend to those who wanted, stand by his neighbours as
a friend, keep counsel and do justice like a magistrate?""It is true--it is true," answered the assembly; "his blood is our blood
as much as if it were Henry Gow's.""You speak truth, neighbours," said Bailie Craigdallie; "and this feud
cannot be patched up as the former was: citizen's blood must not flow
unavenged down our kennels, as if it were ditch water, or we shall soon
see the broad Tay crimsoned with it.But this blow was never meant for
the poor man on whom it has unhappily fallen.Every one knew what Oliver
Proudfute was, how wide he would speak, and how little he would do.He
has Henry Smith's buff coat, target, and head piece.All the town know
them as well as I do: there is no doubt on't.He had the trick, as you
know, of trying to imitate the smith in most things.Some one, blind
with rage, or perhaps through liquor, has stricken the innocent bonnet
maker, whom no man either hated or feared, or indeed cared either much
or little about, instead of the stout smith, who has twenty feuds upon
his hands.""What then, is to be done, bailie?""That, my friends, your magistrates will determine for you, as we shall
instantly meet together when Sir Patrick Charteris cometh here, which
must be anon.Meanwhile, let the chirurgeon Dwining examine that poor
piece of clay, that he may tell us how he came by his fatal death; and
then let the corpse be decently swathed in a clean shroud, as becomes
an honest citizen, and placed before the high altar in the church of
St.Cease all clamour and noise, and
every defensible man of you, as you would wish well to the Fair Town,
keep his weapons in readiness, and be prepared to assemble on the High
Street at the tolling of the common bell from the townhouse, and we will
either revenge the death of our fellow citizen, or else we shall take
such fortune as Heaven will send us.Meanwhile avoid all quarrelling
With the knights and their followers till we know the innocent from the
guilty.But wherefore tarries this knave Smith?He is ready enough
in tumults when his presence is not wanted, and lags he now when his
presence may serve the Fair City?What ails him, doth any one know?Hath
he been upon the frolic last Fastern's Even?""Rather he is sick or sullen, Master Bailie," said one of the city's
mairs, or sergeants; "for though he is within door, as his knaves
report, yet he will neither answer to us nor admit us.""So please your worship, Master Bailie," said Simon Glover, "I will go
myself to fetch Henry Smith.I have some little difference to make up
with him.And blessed be Our Lady, who hath so ordered it that I find
him alive, as a quarter of an hour since I could never have expected!""Bring the stout smith to the council house," said the bailie, as a
mounted yeoman pressed through the crowd and whispered in his ear, "Here
is a good fellow who says the Knight of Kinfauns is entering the port."Such was the occasion of Simon Glover presenting himself at the house of
Henry Gow at the period already noticed.Unrestrained by the considerations of doubt and hesitation which
influenced others, he repaired to the parlour; and having overheard the
bustling of Dame Shoolbred, he took the privilege of intimacy to ascend
to the bedroom, and, with the slight apology of "I crave your pardon,
good neighbour," he opened the door and entered the apartment, where a
singular and unexpected sight awaited him.At the sound of his voice,
May Catharine experienced a revival much speedier than Dame Shoolbred's
restoratives had been able to produce, and the paleness of her
complexion changed into a deep glow of the most lovely red.She pushed
her lover from her with both her hands, which, until this minute, her
want of consciousness, or her affection, awakened by the events of the
morning, had well nigh abandoned to his caresses.Henry Smith, bashful
as we know him, stumbled as he rose up; and none of the party were
without a share of confusion, excepting Dame Shoolbred, who was glad
to make some pretext to turn her back to the others, in order that she
might enjoy a laugh at their expense, which she felt herself utterly
unable to restrain, and in which the glover, whose surprise, though
great, was of short duration, and of a joyful character, sincerely
joined.John," he said, "I thought I had seen a sight this
morning that would cure me of laughter, at least till Lent was over;
but this would make me curl my cheek if I were dying.Why, here stands
honest Henry Smith, who was lamented as dead, and toll'd out for from
every steeple in town, alive, merry, and, as it seems from his ruddy
complexion, as like to live as any man in Perth.And here is my precious
daughter, that yesterday would speak of nothing but the wickedness of
the wights that haunt profane sports and protect glee maidens.Cupid both at defiance--here she is,
turned a glee maiden herself, for what I can see!Truly, I am glad to
see that you, my good Dame Shoolbred, who give way to no disorder, have
been of this loving party.""You do me wrong, my dearest father," said Catharine, as if about to
weep."I came here with far different expectations than you suppose.I
only came because--because--"

"Because you expected to find a dead lover," said her father, "and you
have found a living one, who can receive the tokens of your regard, and
return them.Now, were it not a sin, I could find in my heart to thank
Heaven that thou hast been surprised at last into owning thyself a
woman.Simon Glover is not worthy to have an absolute saint for his
daughter.Nay, look not so piteously, nor expect condolence from me!Only I will try not to look merry, if you will be pleased to stop your
tears, or confess them to be tears of joy.""If I were to die for such a confession," said poor Catharine, "I could
not tell what to call them.Only believe, dear father, and let Henry
believe, that I would never have come hither; unless--unless--"

"Unless you had thought that Henry could not come to you," said her
father."And now, shake hands in peace and concord, and agree as
Valentines should.Yesterday was Shrovetide, Henry; We will hold that
thou hast confessed thy follies, hast obtained absolution, and art
relieved of all the guilt thou stoodest charged with.""Nay touching that, father Simon," said the smith, "now that you are
cool enough to hear me, I can swear on the Gospels, and I can call my
nurse, Dame Shoolbred, to witness--"

"Nay--nay," said the glover, "but wherefore rake up differences which
should all be forgotten?""Hark ye, Simon!--Simon Glover!""True, son Smith," said the glover, seriously, "we have other work in
hand.Catharine shall remain
here with Dame Shoolbred, who will take charge of her till we return;
and then, as the town is in misrule, we two, Harry, will carry her home,
and they will be bold men that cross us.""Nay, my dear father," said Catharine, with a smile, "now you are taking
Oliver Proudfute's office.That doughty burgher is Henry's brother at
arms.""You have spoke a stinging word, daughter; but you know not what has
happened.Kiss him, Catharine, in token of forgiveness.""Not so," said Catharine; "I have done him too much grace already.When
he has seen the errant damsel safe home, it will be time enough to claim
his reward.""Meantime," said Henry, "I will claim, as your host, what you will not
allow me on other terms."He folded the fair maiden in his arms, and was permitted to take the
salute which she had refused to bestow.As they descended the stair together, the old man laid his hand on the
smith's shoulder, and said: "Henry, my dearest wishes are fulfilled;
but it is the pleasure of the saints that it should be in an hour of
difficulty and terror.""True," said the smith; "but thou knowest, father, if our riots be
frequent at Perth, at least they seldom last long."Then, opening a door which led from the house into the smithy, "here,
comrades," he cried, "Anton, Cuthbert, Dingwell, and Ringen!Let none of
you stir from the place till I return.Be as true as the weapons I have
taught you to forge: a French crown and a Scotch merrymaking for you, if
you obey my command.Watch
the doors well, let little Jannekin scout up and down the wynd, and have
your arms ready if any one approaches the house.Open the doors to no
man till father Glover or I return: it concerns my life and happiness."The strong, swarthy giants to whom he spoke answered: "Death to him who
attempts it!""My Catharine is now as safe," said he to her father, "as if twenty men
garrisoned a royal castle in her cause.We shall pass most quietly to
the council house by walking through the garden."He led the way through a little orchard accordingly, where the birds,
which had been sheltered and fed during the winter by the good natured
artisan, early in the season as it was, were saluting the precarious
smiles of a February sun with a few faint and interrupted attempts at
melody."Hear these minstrels, father," said the smith; "I laughed at them this
morning in the bitterness of my heart, because the little wretches sung,
with so much of winter before them.But now, methinks, I could bear a
blythe chorus, for I have my Valentine as they have theirs; and whatever
ill may lie before me for tomorrow, I am today the happiest man in
Perth, city or county, burgh or landward.""Yet I must allay your joy," said the old glover, "though, Heaven knows,
I share it.Poor Oliver Proudfute, the inoffensive fool that you and I
knew so well, has been found this morning dead in the streets."said the smith; "nay, a candle and a dose of
matrimonial advice will bring him to life again."He is slain--slain with a battle axe or some such
weapon."replied the smith; "he was light footed enough, and would
not for all Perth have trusted to his hands, when he could extricate
himself by his heels."The blow was dealt in the very back of his
head; he who struck must have been a shorter man than himself, and used
a horseman's battle axe, or some such weapon, for a Lochaber axe must
have struck the upper part of his head.But there he lies dead, brained,
I may say, by a most frightful wound.""This is inconceivable," said Henry Wynd."He was in my house at
midnight, in a morricer's habit; seemed to have been drinking, though
not to excess.He told me a tale of having been beset by revellers,
and being in danger; but, alas!you know the man--I deemed it was a
swaggering fit, as he sometimes took when he was in liquor; and, may the
Merciful Virgin forgive me!I let him go without company, in which I did
him inhuman wrong.I would have gone with
any helpless creature; and far more with him, with whom I have so often
sat at the same board and drunken of the same cup.Who, of the race
of man, could have thought of harming a creature so simple and so
unoffending, excepting by his idle vaunts?""Henry, he wore thy head piece, thy buff coat; thy target."Why, he demanded the use of them for the night, and I was ill at ease,
and well pleased to be rid of his company, having kept no holiday, and
being determined to keep none, in respect of our misunderstanding.""It is the opinion of Bailie Craigdallie and all our sagest counsellors
that the blow was intended for yourself, and that it becomes you to
prosecute the due vengeance of our fellow citizen, who received the
death which was meant for you."They had now left the garden, and
were walking in a lonely lane, by which they meant to approach the
council house of the burgh without being exposed to observation or idle
inquiry."You are silent, my son, yet we two have much to speak of," said Simon
Glover."Bethink thee that this widowed woman, Maudlin, if she should
see cause to bring a charge against any one for the wrong done to her
and her orphan children, must support it by a champion, according to
law and custom; for, be the murderer who he may, we know enough of these
followers of the nobles to be assured that the party suspected will
appeal to the combat, in derision, perhaps, of we whom they will call
the cowardly burghers.While we are men with blood in our veins, this
must not be, Henry Wynd.""I see where you would draw me, father," answered Henry, dejectedly,
"and St.John knows I have heard a summons to battle as willingly as war
horse ever heard the trumpet.But bethink you, father, how I have lost
Catharine's favour repeatedly, and have been driven well nigh to despair
of ever regaining it, for being, if I may say so, even too ready a man
of my hands.And here are all our quarrels made up, and the hopes that
seemed this morning removed beyond earthly prospect have become
nearer and brighter than ever; and must I with the dear one's kiss of
forgiveness on my lips, engage in a new scene of violence, which you are
well aware will give her the deepest offence?""It is hard for me to advise you, Henry," said Simon; "but this I must
ask you: Have you, or have you not, reason to think that this poor
unfortunate Oliver has been mistaken for you?""I fear it too much," said Henry."He was thought something like me, and
the poor fool had studied to ape my gestures and manner of walking,
nay the very airs which I have the trick of whistling, that he might
increase a resemblance which has cost him dear.I have ill willers
enough, both in burgh and landward, to owe me a shrewd turn; and he, I
think, could have none such.""Well, Henry, I cannot say but my daughter will be offended.She has
been much with Father Clement, and has received notions about peace and
forgiveness which methinks suit ill with a country where the laws cannot
protect us, unless we have spirit to protect ourselves.If you determine
for the combat, I will do my best to persuade her to look on the matter
as the other good womanhood in the burgh will do; and if you resolve to
let the matter rest--the man who has lost his life for yours remaining
unavenged, the widow and the orphans without any reparation for the loss
of a husband and father--I will then do you the justice to think that I,
at least, ought not to think the worse of you for your patience, since
it was adopted for love of my child.But, Henry, we must in that case
remove ourselves from bonny St.Johnston, for here we will be but a
disgraced family."Henry groaned deeply, and was silent for an instant, then replied: "I
would rather be dead than dishonoured, though I should never see her
again!Had it been yester evening, I would have met the best blade among
these men at arms as blythely as ever I danced at a maypole.But today,
when she had first as good as said, 'Henry Smith, I love thee!'Father
Glover; it is very hard.I ought to have allowed him the shelter of my roof, when he
prayed me in his agony of fear; or; had I gone with him, I should then
have prevented or shared his fate.But I taunted him, ridiculed him,
loaded him with maledictions, though the saints know they were uttered
in idle peevishness of impatience.I drove him out from my doors, whom I
knew so helpless, to take the fate which was perhaps intended for me.I must avenge him, or be dishonoured for ever.See, father, I have been
called a man hard as the steel I work in.Does burnished steel ever drop
tears like these?Shame on me that I should shed them!""It is no shame, my dearest son," said Simon; "thou art as kind as
brave, and I have always known it.No one
may be discovered to whom suspicion attaches, and where none such is
found, the combat cannot take place.It is a hard thing to wish that the
innocent blood may not be avenged.But if the perpetrator of this foul
murder be hidden for the present, thou wilt be saved from the task
of seeking that vengeance which Heaven doubtless will take at its own
proper time."As they spoke thus, they arrived at the point of the High Street where
the council house was situated.As they reached the door, and made
their way through the multitude who thronged the street, they found the
avenues guarded by a select party of armed burghers, and about fifty
spears belonging to the Knight of Kinfauns, who, with his allies
the Grays, Blairs, Moncrieffs, and others, had brought to Perth a
considerable body of horse, of which these were a part.So soon as the
glover and smith presented themselves, they were admitted to the chamber
in which the magistrates were assembled.A woman wails for justice at the gate,
     A widow'd woman, wan and desolate.The council room of Perth presented a singular spectacle.In a gloomy
apartment, ill and inconveniently lighted by two windows of different
form and of unequal size, were assembled, around a large oaken table,
a group of men, of whom those who occupied the higher seats were
merchants, that is, guild brethren, or shopkeepers, arrayed in decent
dresses becoming their station, but most of them bearing, like, the
Regent York, "signs of war around their aged necks"--gorgets, namely,
and baldricks, which sustained their weapons.The lower places around
the table were occupied by mechanics and artisans, the presidents, or
deacons, as they were termed, of the working classes, in their ordinary
clothes, somewhat better arranged than usual.These, too, wore pieces
of armour of various descriptions.Some had the blackjack, or doublets
covered with small plates of iron of a lozenge shape, which, secured
through the upper angle, hung in rows above each [other], and which,
swaying with the motion of the wearer's person, formed a secure defence
to the body.Others had buff coats, which, as already mentioned, could
resist the blow of a sword, and even a lance's point, unless propelled
with great force.At the bottom of the table, surrounded as it was
with this varied assembly, sat Sir Louis Lundin; no military man, but
a priest and parson of St.John's, arrayed in his canonical dress, and
having his pen and ink before him.He was town clerk of the burgh,
and, like all the priests of the period (who were called from that
circumstance the Pope's knights), received the honourable title of
Dominus, contracted into Dom, or Dan, or translated into Sir, the title
of reverence due to the secular chivalry.On an elevated seat at the head of the council board was placed Sir
Patrick Charteris, in complete armour brightly burnished--a singular
contrast to the motley mixture of warlike and peaceful attire exhibited
by the burghers, who were only called to arms occasionally.The bearing
of the provost, while it completely admitted the intimate connexion
which mutual interests had created betwixt himself, the burgh, and the
magistracy, was at the same time calculated to assert the superiority
which, in virtue of gentle blood and chivalrous rank, the opinions of
the age assigned to him over the members of the assembly in which he
presided.Two squires stood behind him, one of them holding the knight's
pennon, and another his shield, bearing his armorial distinctions, being
a hand holding a dagger, or short sword, with the proud motto, "This is
my charter."A handsome page displayed the long sword of his master, and
another bore his lance; all which chivalrous emblems and appurtenances
were the more scrupulously exhibited, that the dignitary to whom they
belonged was engaged in discharging the office of a burgh magistrate.In his own person the Knight of Kinfauns appeared to affect something
of state and stiffness which did not naturally pertain to his frank and
jovial character."So you are come at length, Henry Smith and Simon Glover," said the
provost."Know that you have kept us waiting for your attendance.Should
it so chance again while we occupy this place, we will lay such a
fine on you as you will have small pleasure in paying.They are not asked now, and another time they will not
be admitted.Know, sirs, that our reverend clerk hath taken down in
writing, and at full length, what I will tell you in brief, that you may
see what is to be required of you, Henry Smith, in particular.Our
late fellow citizen, Oliver Proudfute, hath been found dead in the High
Street, close by the entrance into the wynd.It seemeth he was slain by
a heavy blow with a short axe, dealt from behind and at unawares;
and the act by which he fell can only be termed a deed of foul and
forethought murder.The criminal can only be
indicated by circumstances.It is recorded in the protocol of the
Reverend Sir Louis Lundin, that divers well reported witnesses saw our
deceased citizen, Oliver Proudfute, till a late period accompanying the
entry of the morrice dancers, of whom he was one, as far as the house of
Simon Glover, in Curfew Street, where they again played their pageant.It is also manifested that at this place he separated from the rest
of the band, after some discourse with Simon Glover, and made an
appointment to meet with the others of his company at the sign of the
Griffin, there to conclude the holiday.Now, Simon, I demand of you
whether this be truly stated, so far as you know?and further, what was
the purport of the defunct Oliver Proudfute's discourse with you?""My Lord Provost and very worshipful Sir Patrick," answered Simon
Glover, "you and this honourable council shall know that, touching
certain reports which had been made of the conduct of Henry Smith, some
quarrel had arisen between myself and another of my family and the said
Smith here present.Now, this our poor fellow citizen, Oliver Proudfute,
having been active in spreading these reports, as indeed his element lay
in such gossipred, some words passed betwixt him and me on the subject;
and, as I think, he left me with the purpose of visiting Henry Smith,
for he broke off from the morrice dancers, promising, as it seems, to
meet them, as your honour has said, at the sign of the Griffin, in order
to conclude the evening.But what he actually did, I know not, as I
never again saw him in life.""It is enough," said Sir Patrick, "and agrees with all that we have
heard.Now, worthy sirs, we next find our poor fellow citizen environed
by a set of revellers and maskers who had assembled in the High Street,
by whom he was shamefully ill treated, being compelled to kneel down
in the street, and there to quaff huge quantities of liquor against
his inclination, until at length he escaped from them by flight.This violence was accomplished with drawn swords, loud shouts, and
imprecations, so as to attract the attention of several persons, who,
alarmed by the tumult, looked out from their windows, as well as of one
or two passengers, who, keeping aloof from the light of the torches,
lest they also had been maltreated, beheld the usage which our fellow
citizen received in the High Street of the burgh.And although these
revellers were disguised, and used vizards, yet their disguises were
well known, being a set of quaint masking habits prepared some weeks
ago by command of Sir John Ramorny, Master of the Horse to his Royal
Highness the Duke of Rothsay, Prince Royal of Scotland.""Yes, so it is, brave burghers," continued Sir Patrick; "our inquiries
have led us into conclusions both melancholy and terrible.But as no one
can regret the point at which they seem likely to arrive more than I do,
so no man living can dread its consequences less.It is even so, various
artisans employed upon the articles have described the dresses prepared
for Sir John Ramorny's mask as being exactly similar to those of the
men by whom Oliver Proudfute was observed to be maltreated.And one
mechanic, being Wingfield the feather dresser, who saw the revellers
when they had our fellow citizen within their hands, remarked that they
wore the cinctures and coronals of painted feathers which he himself had
made by the order of the Prince's master of horse."After the moment of his escape from these revellers, we lose all trace
of Oliver' but we can prove that the maskers went to Sir John Ramorny's,
where they were admitted, after some show of delay.It is rumoured that
thou, Henry Smith, sawest our unhappy fellow citizen after he had been
in the hands of these revellers."He came to my house in the wynd," said Henry, "about half an hour
before midnight; and I admitted him, something unwillingly, as he had
been keeping carnival while I remained at home; and 'There is ill talk,'
says the proverb, 'betwixt a full man and a fasting.'""And in which plight seemed he when thou didst admit him?""He seemed," answered the smith, "out of breath, and talked repeatedly
of having been endangered by revellers.I paid but small regard, for he
was ever a timorous, chicken spirited, though well meaning, man, and
I held that he was speaking more from fancy than reality.But I shall
always account it for foul offence in myself that I did not give him my
company, which he requested; and if I live, I will found masses for his
soul, in expiation of my guilt.""Did he describe those from whom he received the injury?""Revellers in masking habits," replied Henry."And did he intimate his fear of having to do with them on his return?""He alluded particularly to his being waylaid, which I treated as
visionary, having been able to see no one in the lane.""Had he then no help from thee of any kind whatsoever?""Yes, worshipful," replied the smith; "he exchanged his morrice dress
for my head piece, buff coat, and target, which I hear were found upon
his body; and I have at home his morrice cap and bells, with the jerkin
and other things pertaining.He was to return my garb of fence, and get
back his own masking suit this day, had the saints so permitted.""One word more," said the provost."Have you any reason to think that
the blow which slew Oliver Proudfute was meant for another man?""I have," answered the smith; "but it is doubtful, and may be dangerous
to add such a conjecture, which is besides only a supposition.""Speak it out, on your burgher faith and oath.For whom, think you, was
the blow meant?""If I must speak," replied Henry, "I believe Oliver Proudfute received
the fate which was designed for myself; the rather that, in his folly,
Oliver spoke of trying to assume my manner of walking, as well as my
dress.""Have you feud with any one, that you form such an idea?""To my shame and sin be it spoken, I have feud with Highland and
Lowland, English and Scot, Perth and Angus.I do not believe poor
Oliver had feud with a new hatched chicken.he was the more fully
prepared for a sudden call!""Hark ye, smith," said the provost, "answer me distinctly: Is there
cause of feud between the household of Sir John Ramorny and yourself?""To a certainty, my lord, there is.It is now generally said that Black
Quentin, who went over Tay to Fife some days since, was the owner of the
hand which was found in Couvrefew Street upon the eve of St.It was I who struck off that hand with a blow of my broadsword.As this
Black Quentin was a chamberlain of Sir John, and much trusted, it is
like there must be feud between me and his master's dependants.""It bears a likely front, smith," said Sir Patrick Charteris."And now,
good brothers and wise magistrates, there are two suppositions, each of
which leads to the same conclusion.The maskers who seized our fellow
citizen, and misused him in a manner of which his body retains some
slight marks, may have met with their former prisoner as he returned
homewards, and finished their ill usage by taking his life.He himself
expressed to Henry Gow fears that this would be the case.If this be
really true, one or more of Sir John Ramorny's attendants must have
been the assassins.But I think it more likely that one or two of the
revellers may have remained on the field, or returned to it, having
changed perhaps their disguise, and that to those men (for Oliver
Proudfute, in his own personal appearance, would only have been a
subject of sport) his apparition in the dress, and assuming, as he
proposed to do, the manner, of Henry Smith, was matter of deep hatred;
and that, seeing him alone, they had taken, as they thought, a certain
and safe mode to rid themselves of an enemy so dangerous as all men know
Henry Wynd is accounted by those that are his unfriends.The same train
of reasoning, again, rests the guilt with the household of Sir John
Ramorny.Are we not free to charge the crime upon
them?"The magistrates whispered together for several minutes, and then replied
by the voice of Bailie Craigdallie: "Noble knight, and our worthy
provost, we agree entirely in what your wisdom has spoken concerning
this dark and bloody matter; nor do we doubt your sagacity in tracing to
the fellowship and the company of John Ramorny of that ilk the villainy
which hath been done to our deceased fellow citizen, whether in his own
character and capacity or as mistaking him for our brave townsman, Henry
of the Wynd.But Sir John, in his own behalf, and as the Prince's master
of the horse, maintains an extensive household; and as, of course, the
charge will be rebutted by a denial, we would ask how we shall proceed
in that case.It is true, could we find law for firing the lodging, and
putting all within it to the sword; the old proverb of 'Short rede,
good rede,' might here apply; for a fouler household of defiers of God,
destroyers of men, and debauchers of women are nowhere sheltered than
are in Ramorny's band.But I doubt that this summary mode of execution
would scarce be borne out by the laws; and no tittle of evidence which
I have heard will tend to fix the crime on any single individual or
individuals."Before the provost could reply, the town clerk arose, and, stroking
his venerable beard, craved permission to speak, which was instantly
granted."Brethren," he said, "as well in our fathers' time as ours; hath God, on
being rightly appealed to, condescended to make manifest the crimes of
the guilty and the innocence of those who may have been rashly accused.Let us demand from our sovereign lord, King Robert, who, when the wicked
do not interfere to pervert his good intentions, is as just and clement
a prince as our annals can show in their long line, in the name of the
Fair City, and of all the commons in Scotland, that he give us, after
the fashion of our ancestors, the means of appealing to Heaven for light
upon this dark murder, we will demand the proof by 'bier right,' often
granted in the days of our sovereign's ancestors, approved of by bulls
and decretals, and administered by the great Emperor Charlemagne in
France, by King Arthur in Britain, and by Gregory the Great, and the
mighty Achaius, in this our land of Scotland.""I have heard of the bier right, Sir Louis," quoth the provost, "and I
know we have it in our charters of the Fair City; but I am something
ill learned in the ancient laws, and would pray you to inform us more
distinctly of its nature.""We will demand of the King," said Sir Louis Lundin, "my advice being
taken, that the body of our murdered fellow citizen be transported into
the High Church of St.John, and suitable masses said for the benefit
of his soul and for the discovery of his foul murder.Meantime, we shall
obtain an order that Sir John Ramorny give up a list of such of his
household as were in Perth in the course of the night between Fastern's
Even and this Ash Wednesday, and become bound to present them on a
certain day and hour, to be early named, in the High Church of St.John,
there one by one to pass before the bier of our murdered fellow citizen,
and in the form prescribed to call upon God and His saints to bear
witness that he is innocent of the acting, art or part, of the murder.And credit me, as has been indeed proved by numerous instances, that, if
the murderer shall endeavour to shroud himself by making such an appeal,
the antipathy which subsists between the dead body and the hand which
dealt the fatal blow that divorced it from the soul will awaken some
imperfect life, under the influence of which the veins of the dead man
will pour forth at the fatal wounds the blood which has been so long
stagnant in the veins.Or, to speak more certainly, it is the pleasure
of Heaven, by some hidden agency which we cannot comprehend, to leave
open this mode of discovering the wickedness of him who has defaced the
image of his Creator.""I have heard this law talked of," said Sir Patrick, "and it was
enforced in the Bruce's time.This surely is no unfit period to seek, by
such a mystic mode of inquiry, the truth to which no ordinary means can
give us access, seeing that a general accusation of Sir John's household
would full surely be met by a general denial.Yet I must crave farther
of Sir Louis, our reverend town clerk, how we shall prevent the guilty
person from escaping in the interim?""The burghers will maintain a strict watch upon the wall, drawbridges
shall be raised and portcullises lowered, from sunset to sunrise, and
strong patrols maintained through the night.This guard the burghers
will willingly maintain, to secure against the escape of the murderer of
their townsman."The rest of the counsellors acquiesced, by word, sign, and look, in this
proposal."Again," said the provost, "what if any one of the suspected household
refuse to submit to the ordeal of bier right?""He may appeal to that of combat," said the reverend city scribe, "with
an opponent of equal rank; because the accused person must have his
choice, in the appeal to the judgment of God, by what ordeal he will
be tried.But if he refuses both, he must be held as guilty, and so
punished."The sages of the council unanimously agreed with the opinion of their
provost and town clerk, and resolved, in all formality, to petition
the King, as a matter of right, that the murder of their fellow citizen
should be inquired into according to this ancient form, which was held
to manifest the truth, and received as matter of evidence in case of
murder so late as towards the end of the 17th century.But before the
meeting dissolved, Bailie Craigdallie thought it meet to inquire who
was to be the champion of Maudie, or Magdalen, Proudfute and her two
children."There need be little inquiry about that," said Sir Patrick Charteris;
"we are men, and wear swords, which should be broken over the head
of any one amongst us who will not draw it in behalf of the widow and
orphans of our murdered fellow citizen, and in brave revenge of his
death.If Sir John Ramorny shall personally resent the inquiry, Patrick
Charteris of Kinfauns will do battle with him to the outrance, whilst
horse and man may stand, or spear and blade hold together.But in case
the challenger be of yeomanly degree, well wot I that Magdalen Proudfute
may choose her own champion among the bravest burghers of Perth, and
shame and dishonour were it to the Fair City for ever could she light
upon one who were traitor and coward enough to say her nay!Bring her
hither, that she may make her election."Henry Smith heard this with a melancholy anticipation that the poor
woman's choice would light upon him, and that his recent reconciliation
with his mistress would be again dissolved, by his being engaged in a
fresh quarrel, from which there lay no honourable means of escape, and
which, in any other circumstances, he would have welcomed as a glorious
opportunity of distinguishing himself, both in sight of the court and
of the city.He was aware that, under the tuition of Father Clement,
Catharine viewed the ordeal of battle rather as an insult to religion
than an appeal to the Deity, and did not consider it as reasonable that
superior strength of arm or skill of weapon should be resorted to as the
proof of moral guilt or innocence.He had, therefore, much to fear from
her peculiar opinions in this particular, refined as they were beyond
those of the age she lived in.While he thus suffered under these contending feelings, Magdalen,
the widow of the slaughtered man, entered the court, wrapt in a deep
mourning veil, and followed and supported by five or six women of good
(that is, of respectability) dressed in the same melancholy attire.One
of her attendants held an infant in her arms, the last pledge of poor
Oliver's nuptial affections.Another led a little tottering creature of
two years, or thereabouts, which looked with wonder and fear, sometimes
on the black dress in which they had muffled him, and sometimes on the
scene around him.The assembly rose to receive the melancholy group, and saluted them with
an expression of the deepest sympathy, which Magdalen, though the mate
of poor Oliver, returned with an air of dignity, which she borrowed,
perhaps, from the extremity of her distress.Sir Patrick Charteris then
stepped forward, and with the courtesy of a knight to a female, and of a
protector to an oppressed and injured widow, took the poor woman's hand,
and explained to her briefly by what course the city had resolved to
follow out the vengeance due for her husband's slaughter.Having, with a softness and gentleness which did not belong to his
general manner, ascertained that the unfortunate woman perfectly
understood what was meant, he said aloud to the assembly: "Good citizens
of Perth, and freeborn men of guild and craft, attend to what is
about to pass, for it concerns your rights and privileges.Here stands
Magdalen Proudfute, desirous to follow forth the revenge due for the
death of her husband, foully murdered, as she sayeth, by Sir John
Ramorny, Knight, of that Ilk, and which she offers to prove, by the
evidence of bier right, or by the body of a man.Therefore, I, Patrick
Charteris, being a belted knight and freeborn gentleman, offer myself to
do battle in her just quarrel, whilst man and horse may endure, if any
one of my degree shall lift my glove.How say you, Magdalen Proudfute,
will you accept me for your champion?"The widow answered with difficulty: "I can desire none nobler."Sir Patrick then took her right hand in his, and, kissing her forehead,
for such was the ceremony, said solemnly: "So may God and St.John
prosper me at my need, as I will do my devoir as your champion,
knightly, truly, and manfully.Go now, Magdalen, and choose at your will
among the burgesses of the Fair City, present or absent, any one upon
whom you desire to rest your challenge, if he against whom you bring
plaint shall prove to be beneath my degree."All eyes were turned to Henry Smith, whom the general voice had already
pointed out as in every respect the fittest to act as champion on the
occasion.But the widow waited not for the general prompting of their
looks.As soon as Sir Patrick had spoken, she crossed the floor to the
place where, near the bottom of the table, the armourer stood among the
men of his degree, and took him by the hand."Henry Gow, or Smith," she said, "good burgher and draftsman, my--my--"

"Husband," she would have said, but the word would not come forth: she
was obliged to change the expression."He who is gone, loved and prized you over all men; therefore meet it is
that thou shouldst follow out the quarrel of his widow and orphans."If there had been a possibility, which in that age there was not, of
Henry's rejecting or escaping from a trust for which all men seemed to
destine him, every wish and idea of retreat was cut off when the widow
began to address him; and a command from Heaven could hardly have made a
stronger impression than did the appeal of the unfortunate Magdalen.Her
allusion to his intimacy with the deceased moved him to the soul.During
Oliver's life, doubtless, there had been a strain of absurdity in his
excessive predilection for Henry, which, considering how very different
they were in character, had in it something ludicrous.But all this
was now forgotten, and Henry, giving way to his natural ardour, only
remembered that Oliver had been his friend and intimate--a man who had
loved and honoured him as much as he was capable of entertaining such
sentiments for any one, and, above all, that there was much reason to
suspect that the deceased had fallen victim to a blow meant for Henry
himself.It was, therefore, with an alacrity which, the minute before, he could
scarce have commanded, and which seemed to express a stern pleasure,
that, having pressed his lips to the cold brow of the unhappy Magdalen,
the armourer replied:

"I, Henry the Smith, dwelling in the Wynd of Perth, good man and true,
and freely born, accept the office of champion to this widow Magdalen
and these orphans, and will do battle in their quarrel to the death,
with any man whomsoever of my own degree, and that so long as I shall
draw breath.So help me at my need God and good St.There arose from the audience a half suppressed cry, expressing the
interest which the persons present took in the prosecution of the
quarrel, and their confidence in the issue.Sir Patrick Charteris then took measures for repairing to the King's
presence, and demanding leave to proceed with inquiry into the murder
of Oliver Proudfute, according to the custom of bier right, and, if
necessary, by combat.He performed this duty after the town council had dissolved, in a
private interview between himself and the King, who heard of this new
trouble with much vexation, and appointed next morning, after mass,
for Sir Patrick and the parties interested to attend his pleasure in
council.In the mean time, a royal pursuivant was despatched to the
Constable's lodgings, to call over the roll of Sir John Ramorny's
attendants, and charge him, with his whole retinue, under high
penalties, to abide within Perth until the King's pleasure should be
farther known.In God's name, see the lists and all things fit;
     There let them end it--God defend the right!In the same council room of the conventual palace of the Dominicans,
King Robert was seated with his brother Albany, whose affected austerity
of virtue, and real art and dissimulation, maintained so high an
influence over the feeble minded monarch.It was indeed natural that one
who seldom saw things according to their real forms and outlines should
view them according to the light in which they were presented to him by
a bold, astucious man, possessing the claim of such near relationship.Ever anxious on account of his misguided and unfortunate son, the King
was now endeavouring to make Albany coincide in opinion with him in
exculpating Rothsay from any part in the death of the bonnet maker, the
precognition concerning which had been left by Sir Patrick Charteris for
his Majesty's consideration."This is an unhappy matter, brother Robin," he said--"a most unhappy
occurrence, and goes nigh to put strife and quarrel betwixt the nobility
and the commons here, as they have been at war together in so many
distant lands.I see but one cause of comfort in the matter, and that
is, that Sir John Ramorny having received his dismissal from the Duke of
Rothsay's family, it cannot be said that he or any of his people who may
have done this bloody deed--if it has truly been done by them--have been
encouraged or hounded out upon such an errand by my poor boy.I am sure,
brother, you and I can bear witness how readily, upon my entreaties, he
agreed to dismiss Ramorny from his service, on account of that brawl in
Curfew Street.""I remember his doing so," said Albany; "and well do I hope that the
connexion betwixt the Prince and Ramorny has not been renewed since he
seemed to comply with your Grace's wishes.""What mean you
by these expressions, brother?Surely, when David promised to me that,
if that unhappy matter of Curfew Street were but smothered up and
concealed, he would part with Ramorny, as he was a counsellor thought
capable of involving him in similar fooleries, and would acquiesce
in our inflicting on him either exile or such punishment as it should
please us to impose--surely you cannot doubt that he was sincere in his
professions, and would keep his word?Remember you not that, when you
advised that a heavy fine should be levied upon his estate in Fife in
lieu of banishment, the Prince himself seemed to say that exile would be
better for Ramorny, and even for himself?""I remember it well, my royal brother.Nor, truly, could I have
suspected Ramorny of having so much influence over the Prince, after
having been accessory to placing him in a situation so perilous, had
it not been for my royal kinsman's own confession, alluded to by your
Grace, that, if suffered to remain at court, he might still continue to
influence his conduct.I then regretted I had advised a fine in place
of exile.But that time is passed, and now new mischief has occurred,
fraught with much peril to your Majesty, as well as to your royal heir,
and to the whole kingdom."by the soul of Bruce, our immortal ancestor!I entreat thee, my
dearest brother, to take compassion on me.Tell me what evil threatens
my son, or my kingdom?"The features of the King, trembling with anxiety, and his eyes brimful
of tears, were bent upon his brother, who seemed to assume time for
consideration ere he replied.Your Grace believed that the Prince had
no accession to this second aggression upon the citizens of Perth--the
slaughter of this bonnet making fellow, about whose death they clamour,
as a set of gulls about their comrade, when one of the noisy brood is
struck down by a boor's shaft.""Their lives," said the King, "are dear to themselves and their friends,
Robin.""Truly, ay, my liege; and they make them dear to us too, ere we can
settle with the knaves for the least blood wit.But, as I said, your
Majesty thinks the Prince had no share in this last slaughter; I will
not attempt to shake your belief in that delicate point, but will
endeavour to believe along with you.What you think is rule for me,
Robert of Albany will never think otherwise than Robert of broad
Scotland.""Thank you, thank you," said the King, taking his brother's hand."I
knew I might rely that your affection would do justice to poor heedless
Rothsay, who exposes himself to so much misconstruction that he scarcely
deserves the sentiments you feel for him."Albany had such an immovable constancy of purpose, that he was able to
return the fraternal pressure of the King's hand, while tearing up by
the very roots the hopes of the indulgent, fond old man.the Duke continued, with a sigh, "this burly, intractable
Knight of Kinfauns, and his brawling herd of burghers, will not view the
matter as we do.They have the boldness to say that this dead fellow had
been misused by Rothsay and his fellows, who were in the street in mask
and revel, stopping men and women, compelling them to dance, or to drink
huge quantities of wine, with other follies needless to recount; and
they say that the whole party repaired in Sir John Ramorny's, and broke
their way into the house in order to conclude their revel there, thus
affording good reason to judge that the dismissal of Sir John from the
Prince's service was but a feigned stratagem to deceive the public.And
hence they urge that, if ill were done that night by Sir John Ramorny
or his followers, much it is to be thought that the Duke of Rothsay must
have at least been privy to, if he did not authorise, it.""Would they make a murderer
of my boy?would they pretend my David would soil his hands in Scottish
blood without having either provocation or purpose?No--no, they will
not invent calumnies so broad as these, for they are flagrant and
incredible.""Pardon, my liege," answered the Duke of Albany; "they say the cause
of quarrel which occasioned the riot in Curfew Street, and, its
consequences, were more proper to the Prince than to Sir John, since
none suspects, far less believes, that that hopeful enterprise was
conducted for the gratification of the knight of Ramorny.""Thou drivest me mad, Robin!""I am dumb," answered his brother; "I did but speak my poor mind
according to your royal order.""Thou meanest well, I know," said the King; "but, instead of tearing me
to pieces with the display of inevitable calamities, were it not kinder,
Robin, to point me out some mode to escape from them?""True, my liege; but as the only road of extrication is rough and
difficult, it is necessary your Grace should be first possessed with
the absolute necessity of using it, ere you hear it even described.The
chirurgeon must first convince his patient of the incurable condition of
a shattered member, ere he venture to name amputation, though it be the
only remedy."The King at these words was roused to a degree of alarm and indignation
greater than his brother had deemed he could be awakened to."Shattered and mortified member, my Lord of Albany!These are unintelligible words, my lord.If thou appliest them
to our son Rothsay, thou must make them good to the letter, else mayst
thou have bitter cause to rue the consequence.""You construe me too literally, my royal liege," said Albany."I spoke
not of the Prince in such unbeseeming terms, for I call Heaven to
witness that he is dearer to me as the son of a well beloved brother
than had he been son of my own.But I spoke in regard to separating him
from the follies and vanities of life, which holy men say are like to
mortified members, and ought, like them, to be cut off and thrown from
us, as things which interrupt our progress in better things.""I understand--thou wouldst have this Ramorny, who hath been thought the
instrument of my son's follies, exiled from court," said the relieved
monarch, "until these unhappy scandals are forgotten, and our subjects
are disposed to look upon our son with different and more confiding
eyes.""That were good counsel, my liege; but mine went a little--a very
little--farther.I would have the Prince himself removed for some brief
period from court."part with my child, my firstborn, the light of my eyes,
and--wilful as he is--the darling of my heart!"Nay, I did but suggest, my lord; I am sensible of the wound such a
proceeding must inflict on a parent's heart, for am I not myself a
father?"And he hung his head, as if in hopeless despondency.When I think that even our own
influence over him, which, sometimes forgotten in our absence, is ever
effectual whilst he is with us, is by your plan to be entirely removed,
what perils might he not rush upon?I could not sleep in his absence--I
should hear his death groan in every breeze; and you, Albany, though you
conceal it better, would be nearly as anxious."Thus spoke the facile monarch, willing to conciliate his brother and
cheat himself, by taking it for granted that an affection, of which
there were no traces, subsisted betwixt the uncle and nephew."Your paternal apprehensions are too easily alarmed, my lord," said
Albany."I do not propose to leave the disposal of the Prince's motions
to his own wild pleasure.I understand that the Prince is to be placed
for a short time under some becoming restraint--that he should
be subjected to the charge of some grave counsellor, who must be
responsible both for his conduct and his safety, as a tutor for his
pupil."a tutor, and at Rothsay's age!"exclaimed the' King; "he is two
years beyond the space to which our laws limit the term of nonage.""The wiser Romans," said Albany, "extended it for four years after the
period we assign; and, in common sense, the right of control ought to
last till it be no longer necessary, and so the time ought to vary with
the disposition.Here is young Lindsay, the Earl of Crawford, who they
say gives patronage to Ramorny on this appeal.He is a lad of fifteen,
with the deep passions and fixed purpose of a man of thirty; while my
royal nephew, with much more amiable and noble qualities both of head
and heart, sometimes shows, at twenty-three years of age, the wanton
humours of a boy, towards whom restraint may be kindness.And do not
be discouraged that it is so, my liege, or angry with your brother for
telling the truth; since the best fruits are those that are slowest in
ripening, and the best horses such as give most trouble to the grooms
who train them for the field or lists."The Duke stopped, and, after suffering King Robert to indulge for two
or three minutes in a reverie which he did not attempt to interrupt, he
added, in a more lively tone: "But, cheer up, my noble liege; perhaps
the feud may be made up without farther fighting or difficulty.The
widow is poor, for her husband, though he was much employed, had idle
and costly habits.The matter may be therefore redeemed for money, and
the amount of an assythment may be recovered out of Ramorny's estate.""Nay, that we will ourselves discharge," said King Robert, eagerly
catching at the hope of a pacific termination of this unpleasing debate."Ramorny's prospects will be destroyed by his being sent from court
and deprived of his charge in Rothsay's household, and it would be
ungenerous to load a falling man.But here comes our secretary, the
prior, to tell us the hour of council approaches."Benedicite, my royal liege," answered the abbot."Now, good father," continued the King, "without waiting for Rothsay,
whose accession to our counsels we will ourselves guarantee, proceed we
to the business of our kingdom."He has arrived at his castle of Tantallon, my liege, and has sent a
post to say, that, though the Earl of March remains in sullen seclusion
in his fortress of Dunbar, his friends and followers are gathering and
forming an encampment near Coldingham, Where it is supposed they intend
to await the arrival of a large force of English, which Hotspur and Sir
Ralph Percy are assembling on the English frontier.""That is cold news," said the King; "and may God forgive George of
Dunbar!"The Prince entered as he spoke, and he continued: "Ha!thou art here at
length, Rothsay; I saw thee not at mass.""I was an idler this morning," said the Prince, "having spent a restless
and feverish night."answered the King; "hadst thou not been over restless
on Fastern's Eve, thou hadst not been feverish on the night of Ash
Wednesday.""Let me not interrupt your praying, my liege," said the Prince,
lightly."Your Grace Was invoking Heaven in behalf of some one--an enemy
doubtless, for these have the frequent advantage of your orisons.""Sit down and be at peace, foolish youth!"said his father, his eye
resting at the same time on the handsome face and graceful figure of
his favourite son.Rothsay drew a cushion near to his father's feet, and
threw himself carelessly down upon it, while the King resumed."I was regretting that the Earl of March, having separated warm from
my hand with full assurance that he should receive compensation for
everything which he could complain of as injurious, should have been
capable of caballing with Northumberland against his own country.Is it
possible he could doubt our intentions to make good our word?""I will answer for him--no," said the Prince."March never doubted your
Highness's word.Marry, he may well have made question whether your
learned counsellors would leave your Majesty the power of keeping it."Robert the Third had adopted to a great extent the timid policy of not
seeming to hear expressions which, being heard, required, even in his
own eyes, some display of displeasure.He passed on, therefore, in his
discourse, without observing his son's speech, but in private Rothsay's
rashness augmented the displeasure which his father began to entertain
against him."It is well the Douglas is on the marches," said the King."His
breast, like those of his ancestors, has ever been the best bulwark of
Scotland.""Then woe betide us if he should turn his back to the enemy," said the
incorrigible Rothsay."Dare you impeach the courage of Douglas?"replied the King, extremely
chafed."No man dare question the Earl's courage," said Rothsay, "it is as
certain as his pride; but his luck may be something doubted."Andrew, David," exclaimed his father, "thou art like a screech
owl, every word thou sayest betokens strife and calamity.""I am silent, father," answered the youth.continued the King,
addressing the prior."I trust they have assumed a favourable aspect," answered the clergyman."The fire which threatened the whole country is likely to be drenched
out by the blood of some forty or fifty kerne; for the two great
confederacies have agreed, by solemn indenture of arms, to decided their
quarrel with such weapons as your Highness may name, and in your royal
presence, in such place as shall be appointed, on the 30th of March next
to come, being Palm Sunday; the number of combatants being limited to
thirty on each side; and the fight to be maintained to extremity, since
they affectionately make humble suit and petition to your Majesty that
you will parentally condescend to waive for the day your royal privilege
of interrupting the combat, by flinging down of truncheon or crying of
'Ho!'until the battle shall be utterly fought to an end."exclaimed the King, "would they limit our best and
dearest royal privilege, that of putting a stop to strife, and crying
truce to battle?Will they remove the only motive which could bring me
to the butcherly spectacle of their combat?Would they fight like men,
or like their own mountain wolves?""My lord," said Albany, "the Earl of Crawford and I had presumed,
without consulting you, to ratify that preliminary, for the adoption of
which we saw much and pressing reason.""Methinks he is a young
counsellor on such grave occurrents.""He is," replied Albany, "notwithstanding his early years, of such
esteem among his Highland neighbours, that I could have done little with
them but for his aid and influence."said the King reproachfully to his heir."I pity Crawford, sire," replied the Prince."He has too early lost a
father whose counsels would have better become such a season as this."The King turned next towards Albany with a look of triumph, at the
filial affection which his son displayed in his reply."It is not the life of these
Highlandmen, but their death, which is to be profitable to this
commonwealth of Scotland; and truly it seemed to the Earl of Crawford
and myself most desirable that the combat should be a strife of
extermination.""Marry," said the Prince, "if such be the juvenile policy of Lindsay, he
will be a merciful ruler some ten or twelve years hence!Out upon a boy
that is hard of heart before he has hair upon his lip!Better he had
contented himself with fighting cocks on Fastern's Even than laying
schemes for massacring men on Palm Sunday, as if he were backing a Welsh
main, where all must fight to death.""Rothsay is right, Albany," said the King: "it were unlike a Christian
monarch to give way in this point.I cannot consent to see men battle
until they are all hewn down like cattle in the shambles.It would
sicken me to look at it, and the warder would drop from my hand for mere
lack of strength to hold it.""It would drop unheeded," said Albany."Let me entreat your Grace to
recollect, that you only give up a royal privilege which, exercised,
would win you no respect, since it would receive no obedience.Were your
Majesty to throw down your warder when the war is high, and these men's
blood is hot, it would meet no more regard than if a sparrow should drop
among a herd of battling wolves the straw which he was carrying to his
nest.Nothing will separate them but the exhaustion of slaughter; and
better they sustain it at the hands of each other than from the swords
of such troops as might attempt to separate them at your Majesty's
commands.An attempt to keep the peace by violence would be construed
into an ambush laid for them; both parties would unite to resist it, the
slaughter would be the same, and the hoped for results of future peace
would be utterly disappointed.""There is even too much truth in what you say, brother Robin," replied
the flexible King."To little purpose is it to command what I cannot
enforce; and, although I have the unhappiness to do so each day of
my life, it were needless to give such a very public example of royal
impotency before the crowds who may assemble to behold this spectacle.Let these savage men, therefore, work their bloody will to the uttermost
upon each other: I will not attempt to forbid what I cannot prevent them
from executing.I will to my oratory
and pray for her, since to aid her by hand and head is alike denied to
me.Father prior, I pray the support of your arm.""Nay, but, brother," said Albany, "forgive me if I remind you that we
must hear the matter between the citizens of Perth and Ramorny, about
the death of a townsman--"

"True--true," said the monarch, reseating himself; "more violence--more
battle.if the best blood of thy bravest
children could enrich thy barren soil, what land on earth would excel
thee in fertility!When is it that a white hair is seen on the beard of
a Scottishman, unless he be some wretch like thy sovereign, protected
from murder by impotence, to witness the scenes of slaughter to which he
cannot put a period?They are in haste
to kill, and, grudge each other each fresh breath of their Creator's
blessed air.The demon of strife and slaughter hath possessed the whole
land!"As the mild prince threw himself back on his seat with an air of
impatience and anger not very usual with him, the door at the lower end
of the room was unclosed, and, advancing from the gallery into which
it led (where in perspective was seen a guard of the Bute men, or
Brandanes, under arms), came, in mournful procession, the widow of poor
Oliver, led by Sir Patrick Charteris, with as much respect as if she had
been a lady of the first rank.Behind them came two women of good, the
wives of magistrates of the city, both in mourning garments, one bearing
the infant and the other leading the elder child.The smith followed in
his best attire, and wearing over his buff coat a scarf of crape.Bailie
Craigdallie and a brother magistrate closed the melancholy procession,
exhibiting similar marks of mourning.The good King's transitory passion was gone the instant he looked at
the pallid countenance of the sorrowing widow, and beheld the
unconsciousness of the innocent orphans who had sustained so great a
loss, and when Sir Patrick Charteris had assisted Magdalen Proudfute to
kneel down and, still holding her hand, kneeled himself on one knee,
it was with a sympathetic tone that King Robert asked her name and
business.She made no answer, but muttered something, looking towards
her conductor."Speak for the poor woman, Sir Patrick Charteris," said the King, "and
tell us the cause of her seeking our presence.""So please you, my liege," answered Sir Patrick, rising up, "this woman,
and these unhappy orphans, make plaint to your Highness upon Sir John
Ramorny of Ramorny, Knight, that by him, or by some of his household,
her umquhile husband, Oliver Proudfute, freeman and burgess of Perth,
was slain upon the streets of the city on the eve of Shrove Tuesday or
morning of Ash Wednesday.""Woman," replied the King, with much kindness, "thou art gentle by sex,
and shouldst be pitiful even by thy affliction; for our own calamity
ought to make us--nay, I think it doth make us--merciful to others.Thy
husband hath only trodden the path appointed to us all.""In his case," said the widow, "my liege must remember it has been a
brief and a bloody one."But since I have been unable to
protect him, as I confess was my royal duty, I am willing, in atonement,
to support thee and these orphans, as well or better than you lived in
the days of your husband; only do thou pass from this charge, and be
not the occasion of spilling more life.Remember, I put before you the
choice betwixt practising mercy and pursuing vengeance, and that betwixt
plenty and penury.""It is true, my liege, we are poor," answered the widow, with unshaken
firmness "but I and my children will feed with the beasts of the field
ere we live on the price of my husband's blood.I demand the combat by
my champion, as you are belted knight and crowned king.""In Scotland
the first words stammered by an infant and the last uttered by a dying
greybeard are 'combat--blood--revenge.'He was dressed in a long furred
robe, such as men of quality wore when they were unarmed.Concealed by
the folds of drapery, his wounded arm was supported by a scarf or
sling of crimson silk, and with the left arm he leaned on a youth,
who, scarcely beyond the years of boyhood, bore on his brow the deep
impression of early thought and premature passion.This was that
celebrated Lindsay, Earl of Crawford, who, in his after days, was known
by the epithet of the Tiger Earl, and who ruled the great and rich
valley of Strathmore with the absolute power and unrelenting cruelty of
a feudal tyrant.Two or three gentlemen, friends of the Earl, or of his
own, countenanced Sir John Ramorny by their presence on this occasion.The charge was again stated, and met by a broad denial on the part
of the accused; and in reply, the challengers offered to prove their
assertion by an appeal to the ordeal of bier right."I am not bound," answered Sir John Ramorny, "to submit to this ordeal,
since I can prove, by the evidence of my late royal master, that I was
in my own lodgings, lying on my bed, ill at ease, while this provost and
these bailies pretend I was committing a crime to which I had neither
will nor temptation.I can therefore be no just object of suspicion.""I can aver," said the Prince, "that I saw and conversed with Sir John
Ramorny about some matters concerning my own household on the very night
when this murder was a-doing.I therefore know that he was ill at ease,
and could not in person commit the deed in question.But I know nothing
of the employment of his attendants, and will not take it upon me to say
that some one of them may not have been guilty of the crime now charged
on them."Sir John Ramorny had, during the beginning of this speech, looked
round with an air of defiance, which was somewhat disconcerted by the
concluding sentence of Rothsay's speech."I thank your Highness," he said, with a smile, "for your cautious and
limited testimony in my behalf.He was wise who wrote, 'Put not your
faith in princes.'""If you have no other evidence of your innocence, Sir John Ramorny,"
said the King, "we may not, in respect to your followers, refuse to
the injured widow and orphans, the complainers, the grant of a proof by
ordeal of bier right, unless any of them should prefer that of combat.For yourself, you are, by the Prince's evidence, freed from the
attaint.""My liege," answered Sir John, "I can take warrant upon myself for the
innocence of my household and followers.""Why, so a monk or a woman might speak," said Sir Patrick Charteris."In
knightly language, wilt thou, Sir John de Ramorny, do battle with me in
the behalf of thy followers?""The provost of Perth had not obtained time to name the word combat,"
said Ramorny, "ere I would have accepted it.But I am not at present fit
to hold a lance.""I am glad of it, under your favour, Sir John.There will be the less
bloodshed," said the King."You must therefore produce your followers
according to your steward's household book, in the great church of
St.John, that, in presence of all whom it may concern, they may purge
themselves of this accusation.See that every man of them do appear at
the time of high mass, otherwise your honour may be sorely tainted.""They shall attend to a man," said Sir John Ramorny.Then bowing low to the King, he directed himself to the young Duke of
Rothsay, and, making a deep obeisance, spoke so as to be heard by him
alone."You have used me generously, my lord!One word of your lips
could have ended this controversy, and you have refused to speak it.""On my life," whispered the Prince, "I spake as far as the extreme verge
of truth and conscience would permit.I think thou couldst not expect
I should frame lies for thee; and after all, John, in my broken
recollections of that night, I do bethink me of a butcherly looking
mute, with a curtal axe, much like such a one as may have done yonder
night job.Ramorny made no answer, but turned as precipitately as if some one had
pressed suddenly on his wounded arm, and regained his lodgings with
the Earl of Crawford; to whom, though disposed for anything rather than
revelry, he was obliged to offer a splendid collation, to acknowledge
in some degree his sense of the countenance which the young noble had
afforded him.In pottingry he wrocht great pyne;
     He murdreit mony in medecyne.When, after an entertainment the prolonging of which was like torture to
the wounded knight, the Earl of Crawford at length took horse, to go
to his distant quarters in the Castle of Dupplin, where he resided as
a guest, the Knight of Ramorny retired into his sleeping apartment,
agonized by pains of body and anxiety of mind.Here he found Henbane
Dwining, on whom it was his hard fate to depend for consolation in both
respects.The physician, with his affectation of extreme humility, hoped
he saw his exalted patient merry and happy."Merry as a mad dog," said Ramorny, "and happy as the wretch whom the
cur hath bitten, and who begins to feel the approach of the ravening
madness!That ruthless boy, Crawford, saw my agony, and spared not a
single carouse.I must do him justice, forsooth!If I had done justice
to him and to the world, I had thrown him out of window and cut short
a career which, if he grew up as he has begun, will prove a source of
misery to all Scotland, but especially to Tayside.Take heed as thou
undoest the ligatures, chirurgeon, the touch of a fly's wing on that raw
glowing stump were like a dagger to me.""Fear not, my noble patron," said the leech, with a chuckling laugh
of enjoyment, which he vainly endeavoured to disguise under a tone of
affected sensibility."We will apply some fresh balsam, and--he, he,
he!--relieve your knightly honour of the irritation which you sustain so
firmly."said Ramorny, grinning with pain; "I sustain it as I
would the scorching flames of purgatory.The bone seems made of red hot
iron; thy greasy ointment will hiss as it drops upon the wound.And yet
it is December's ice, compared to the fever fit of my mind!""We will first use our emollients upon the body, my noble patron," said
Dwining; "and then, with your knighthood's permission; your servant will
try his art on the troubled mind; though I fain hope even the mental
pain also may in some degree depend on the irritation of the wound, and
that, abated as I trust the corporeal pangs will soon be, perhaps the
stormy feelings of the mind may subside of themselves.""Henbane Dwining," said the patient, as he felt the pain of his wound
assuaged, "thou art a precious and invaluable leech, but some things
are beyond thy power.Thou canst stupify my bodily cause of this raging
agony, but thou canst not teach me to bear the score of the boy whom I
have brought up--whom I loved, Dwining--for I did love him--dearly love
him!The worst of my ill deeds have been to flatter his vices; and he
grudged me a word of his mouth, when a word would have allayed this
cumber!He smiled, too--I saw him smile--when yon paltry provost,
the companion and patron of wretched burghers, defied me, whom this
heartless prince knew to be unable to bear arms.Ere I forget or forgive
it, thou thyself shalt preach up the pardoning of injuries!Think'st thou, Henbane Dwining, that, in very
reality, the Wounds of the slaughtered corpse will gape and shed tears
of fresh blood at the murderer's approach?""I cannot tell, my lord, save by report," said Dwining, "which avouches
the fact.""The brute Bonthron," said Ramorny, "is startled at the apprehension of
such a thing, and speaking of being rather willing to stand the combat."It is the armourer's trade to deal with steel," replied Dwining."Were Bonthron to fall, it would little grieve me," said Ramorny;
"though I should miss an useful hand.""I well believe your lordship will not sorrow as for that you lost in
Curfew Street.Excuse my pleasantry, he, he!But what are the useful
properties of this fellow Bonthron?""Those of a bulldog," answered the knight, "he worries without barking.""You have no fear of his confessing?""Who can tell what the dread of approaching death may do?""He has already shown a timorousness entirely alien from his
ordinary sullenness of nature; he, that would scarce wash his hands
after he had slain a man, is now afraid to see a dead body bleed.""Well," said the leech, "I must do something for him if I can, since it
was to further my revenge that he struck yonder downright blow, though
by ill luck it lighted not where it was intended.""And whose fault was that, timid villain," said Ramorny, "save thine
own, who marked a rascal deer for a buck of the first head?""Benedicite, noble sir," replied the mediciner; "would you have me, who
know little save of chamber practice, be as skilful of woodcraft as
your noble self, or tell hart from hind, doe from roe, in a glade at
midnight?I misdoubted me little when I saw the figure run past us to
the smith's habitation in the wynd, habited like a morrice dancer; and
yet my mind partly misgave me whether it was our man, for methought he
seemed less of stature.But when he came out again, after so much time
as to change his dress, and swaggered onward with buff coat and steel
cap, whistling after the armourer's wonted fashion, I do own I was
mistaken super totam materiem, and loosed your knighthood's bulldog upon
him, who did his devoir most duly, though he pulled down the wrong deer.Therefore, unless the accursed smith kill our poor friend stone dead on
the spot, I am determined, if art may do it, that the ban dog Bonthron
shall not miscarry.""It will put thine art to the test, man of medicine," said Ramorny; "for
know that, having the worst of the combat, if our champion be not killed
stone dead in the lists, he will be drawn forth of them by the heels,
and without further ceremony knitted up to the gallows, as convicted of
the murder; and when he hath swung there like a loose tassel for an
hour or so, I think thou wilt hardly take it in hand to cure his broken
neck.""I am of a different opinion, may it please your knighthood," answered
Dwining, gently."I will carry him off from the very foot of the gallows
into the land of faery, like King Arthur, or Sir Huon of Bordeaux, or
Ugero the Dane; or I will, if I please, suffer him to dangle on the
gibbet for a certain number of minutes, or hours, and then whisk him
away from the sight of all, with as much ease as the wind wafts away the
withered leaf.""This is idle boasting, sir leech," replied Ramorny."The whole mob of
Perth will attend him to the gallows, each more eager than another to
see the retainer of a nobleman die, for the slaughter of a cuckoldly
citizen.There will be a thousand of them round the gibbet's foot.""And were there ten thousand," said Dwining, "shall I, who am a high
clerk, and have studied in Spain, and Araby itself, not be able to
deceive the eyes of this hoggish herd of citizens, when the pettiest
juggler that ever dealt in legerdemain can gull even the sharp
observation of your most intelligent knighthood?I tell you, I will put
the change on them as if I were in possession of Keddie's ring.""If thou speakest truth," answered the knight, "and I think thou darest
not palter with me on such a theme, thou must have the aid of Satan, and
I will have nought to do with him.Dwining indulged in his internal chuckling laugh when he heard his
patron testify his defiance of the foul fiend, and saw him second it by
crossing himself.He composed himself, however, upon observing Ramorny's
aspect become very stern, and said, with tolerable gravity, though a
little interrupted by the effort necessary to suppress his mirthful
mood:

"Confederacy, most devout sir--confederacy is the soul of jugglery.But--he, he, he!--I have not the honour to be--he, he!--an ally of the
gentleman of whom you speak--in whose existence I am--he, he!--no
very profound believer, though your knightship, doubtless, hath better
opportunities of acquaintance.""Proceed, rascal, and without that sneer, which thou mayst otherwise
dearly pay for.""I will, most undaunted," replied Dwining."Know that I have my
confederate too, else my skill were little worth.""And who may that be, pray you?""Stephen Smotherwell, if it like your honour, lockman of this Fair City.I marvel your knighthood knows him not.""And I marvel thy knaveship knows him not on professional acquaintance,"
replied Ramorny; "but I see thy nose is unslit, thy ears yet uncropped,
and if thy shoulders are scarred or branded, thou art wise for using a
high collared jerkin."your honour is pleasant," said the mediciner."It is not by
personal circumstances that I have acquired the intimacy of Stephen
Smotherwell, but on account of a certain traffic betwixt us, in which
an't please you, I exchange certain sums of silver for the bodies,
heads, and limbs of those who die by aid of friend Stephen."exclaimed the knight with horror, "is it to compose charms and
forward works of witchcraft that you trade for these miserable relics of
mortality?"No, an it please your knighthood," answered the mediciner,
much amused with the ignorance of his patron; "but we, who are knights
of the scalpel, are accustomed to practise careful carving of the limbs
of defunct persons, which we call dissection, whereby we discover, by
examination of a dead member, how to deal with one belonging to a living
man, which hath become diseased through injury or otherwise.if your
honour saw my poor laboratory, I could show you heads and hands, feet
and lungs, which have been long supposed to be rotting in the mould.The skull of Wallace, stolen from London Bridge; the head of Sir
Simon Fraser [the famous ancestor of the Lovats, slain at Halidon Hill
(executed in London in 1306)], that never feared man; the lovely skull
of the fair Katie Logie [(should be Margaret Logie), the beautiful
mistress of David II].Oh, had I but had the fortune to have preserved
the chivalrous hand of mine honoured patron!"Thinkest thou to disgust me with thy catalogue of
horrors?How can thy traffic
with the hangdog executioner be of avail to serve me, or to help my
servant Bonthron?""Nay, I do not recommend it to your knighthood, save in an extremity,"
replied Dwining."But we will suppose the battle fought and our cock
beaten.Now we must first possess him with the certainty that, if unable
to gain the day, we will at least save him from the hangman, provided he
confess nothing which can prejudice your knighthood's honour."ay, a thought strikes me," said Ramorny."We can do more than this,
we can place a word in Bonthron's mouth that will be troublesome enough
to him whom I am bound to curse for being the cause of my misfortune.Let us to the ban dog's kennel, and explain to him what is to be done
in every view of the question.If we can persuade him to stand the bier
ordeal, it may be a mere bugbear, and in that case we are safe.If he
take the combat, he is fierce as a baited bear, and may, perchance,
master his opponent; then we are more than safe, we are avenged.If
Bonthron himself is vanquished, we will put thy device in exercise; and
if thou canst manage it cleanly; we may dictate his confession, take the
advantage of it, as I will show thee on further conference, and make a
giant stride towards satisfaction for my wrongs.Suppose our mastiff mortally wounded in the lists, who shall
prevent his growling out some species of confession different from what
we would recommend?""Marry, that can his mediciner," said Dwining."Let me wait on him, and
have the opportunity to lay but a finger on his wound, and trust me he
shall betray no confidence.""Why, there's a willing fiend, that needs neither pushing nor
prompting!""As I trust I shall need neither in your knighthood's service.""We will go indoctrinate our agent," continued the knight."We shall
find him pliant; for, hound as he is, he knows those who feed from those
who browbeat him; and he holds a late royal master of mine in deep hate
for some injurious treatment and base terms which he received at his
hand.I must also farther concert with thee the particulars of
thy practice, for saving the ban dog from the hands of the herd of
citizens."We leave this worthy pair of friends to their secret practices, of which
we shall afterwards see the results.They were, although of different
qualities, as well matched for device and execution of criminal projects
as the greyhound is to destroy the game which the slowhound raises, or
the slowhound to track the prey which the gazehound discovers by the
eye.Pride and selfishness were the characteristics of both; but, from
the difference of rank, education, and talents, they had assumed the
most different appearance in the two individuals.Nothing could less resemble the high blown ambition of the favourite
courtier, the successful gallant, and the bold warrior than the
submissive, unassuming mediciner, who seemed even to court and delight
in insult; whilst, in his secret soul, he felt himself possessed of a
superiority of knowledge, a power both of science and of mind, which
placed the rude nobles of the day infinitely beneath him.So conscious
was Henbane Dwining of this elevation, that, like a keeper of wild
beasts, he sometimes adventured, for his own amusement, to rouse the
stormy passions of such men as Ramorny, trusting, with his humble
manner, to elude the turmoil he had excited, as an Indian boy will
launch his light canoe, secure from its very fragility, upon a broken
surf, in which the boat of an argosy would be assuredly dashed to
pieces.That the feudal baron should despise the humble practitioner
in medicine was a matter of course; but Ramorny felt not the less the
influence which Dwining exercised over him, and was in the encounter
of their wits often mastered by him, as the most eccentric efforts of
a fiery horse are overcome by a boy of twelve years old, if he has been
bred to the arts of the manege.But the contempt of Dwining for Ramorny
was far less qualified.He regarded the knight, in comparison with
himself, as scarcely rising above the brute creation; capable, indeed,
of working destruction, as the bull with his horns or the wolf with his
fangs, but mastered by mean prejudices, and a slave to priest craft, in
which phrase Dwining included religion of every kind.On the whole, he
considered Ramorny as one whom nature had assigned to him as a serf, to
mine for the gold which he worshipped, and the avaricious love of
which was his greatest failing, though by no means his worst vice.He
vindicated this sordid tendency in his own eyes by persuading himself
that it had its source in the love of power."Henbane Dwining," he said, as he gazed in delight upon the hoards which
he had secretly amassed, and which he visited from time to time, "is no
silly miser that doats on those pieces for their golden lustre: it is
the power with which they endow the possessor which makes him thus adore
them.What is there that these put not within your command?Do you love
beauty, and are mean, deformed, infirm, and old?Here is a lure the
fairest hawk of them all will stoop to.Are you feeble, weak, subject
to the oppression of the powerful?Here is that will arm in your defence
those more mighty than the petty tyrant whom you fear.Are you splendid
in your wishes, and desire the outward show of opulence?This dark chest
contains many a wide range of hill and dale, many a fair forest full
of game, the allegiance of a thousand vassals.Wish you for favour in
courts, temporal or spiritual?The smiles of kings, the pardon of popes
and priests for old crimes, and the indulgence which encourages priest
ridden fools to venture on new ones--all these holy incentives to vice
may be purchased for gold.Revenge itself, which the gods are said to
reserve to themselves, doubtless because they envy humanity so sweet a
morsel--revenge itself is to be bought by it.But it is also to be won
by superior skill, and that is the nobler mode of reaching it.I will
spare, then, my treasure for other uses, and accomplish my revenge
gratis; or rather I will add the luxury of augmented wealth to the
triumph of requited wrongs."Thus thought Dwining, as, returned from his visit to Sir John Ramorny,
he added the gold he had received for his various services to the mass
of his treasure; and, having gloated over the whole for a minute or two,
turned the key on his concealed treasure house, and walked forth on his
visits to his patients, yielding the wall to every man whom he met and
bowing and doffing his bonnet to the poorest burgher that owned a petty
booth, nay, to the artificers who gained their precarious bread by the
labour of their welked hands."Caitiffs," was the thought of his heart while he did such
obeisance--"base, sodden witted mechanics!did you know what this
key could disclose, what foul weather from heaven would prevent your
unbonneting?what putrid kennel in your wretched hamlet would be
disgusting enough to make you scruple to fall down and worship the owner
of such wealth?But I will make you feel my power, though it suits my
honour to hide the source of it.I will be an incubus to your city,
since you have rejected me as a magistrate.Like the night mare, I will
hag ride ye, yet remain invisible myself.This miserable Ramorny, too,
he who, in losing his hand, has, like a poor artisan, lost the only
valuable part of his frame, he heaps insulting language on me, as if
anything which he can say had power to chafe a constant mind like mine!Yet, while he calls me rogue, villain, and slave, he acts as wisely as
if he should amuse himself by pulling hairs out of my head while my hand
had hold of his heart strings.Every insult I can pay back instantly
by a pang of bodily pain or mental agony, and--he, he!--I run no long
accounts with his knighthood, that must be allowed."While the mediciner was thus indulging his diabolical musing, and
passing, in his creeping manner, along the street, the cry of females
was heard behind him."Ay, there he is, Our Lady be praised!--there is the most helpful man in
Perth," said one voice."They may speak of knights and kings for redressing wrongs, as they
call it; but give me worthy Master Dwining the potter carrier, cummers,"
replied another.At the same moment, the leech was surrounded and taken hold of by the
speakers, good women of the Fair City.said Dwining, "whose cow has calved?""There is no calving in the case," said one of the women, "but a poor
fatherless wean dying; so come awa' wi' you, for our trust is constant
in you, as Bruce said to Donald of the Isles.""Opiferque per orbem dicor," said Henbane Dwining."What is the child
dying of?""The croup--the croup," screamed one of the gossips; "the innocent is
rouping like a corbie.""Cynanche trachealis--that disease makes brief work.Show me the house
instantly," continued the mediciner, who was in the habit of exercising
his profession liberally, not withstanding his natural avarice, and
humanely, in spite of his natural malignity.As we can suspect him of no
better principle, his motive most probably may have been vanity and the
love of his art.He would nevertheless have declined giving his attendance in the present
case had he known whither the kind gossips were conducting him, in time
sufficient to frame an apology.But, ere he guessed where he was going,
the leech was hurried into the house of the late Oliver Proudfute, from
which he heard the chant of the women as they swathed and dressed the
corpse of the umquhile bonnet maker for the ceremony of next morning, of
which chant the following verses may be received as a modern imitation:

     Viewless essence, thin and bare,
     Well nigh melted into air,
     Still with fondness hovering near
     The earthly form thou once didst wear,

     Pause upon thy pinion's flight;
     Be thy course to left or right,
     Be thou doom'd to soar or sink,
     Pause upon the awful brink.To avenge the deed expelling
     Thee untimely from thy dwelling,
     Mystic force thou shalt retain
     O'er the blood and o'er the brain.When the form thou shalt espy
     That darken'd on thy closing eye,
     When the footstep thou shalt hear
     That thrill'd upon thy dying ear,

     Then strange sympathies shall wake,
     The flesh shall thrill, the nerves shall quake,
     The wounds renew their clotter'd flood,
     And every drop cry blood for blood!Hardened as he was, the physician felt reluctance to pass the threshold
of the man to whose death he had been so directly, though, so far as the
individual was concerned, mistakingly, accessory."Let me pass on, women," he said, "my art can only help the living--the
dead are past our power.""Nay, but your patient is upstairs--the youngest orphan"--Dwining was
compelled to go into the house.But he was surprised when, the instant
he stepped over the threshold, the gossips, who were busied with the
dead body, stinted suddenly in their song, while one said to the others:

"In God's name, who entered?"Not so," said another voice, "it is a drop of the liquid balm.""Nay, cummer, it was blood.Again I say, who entered the house even
now?"One looked out from the apartment into the little entrance, where
Dwining, under pretence of not distinctly seeing the trap ladder by
which he was to ascend into the upper part of this house of lamentation,
was delaying his progress purposely, disconcerted with what had reached
him of the conversation."Nay, it is only worthy Master Henbane Dwining," answered one of the
sibyls."Only Master Dwining," replied the one who had first spoken, in a tone
of acquiescence--"our best helper in need!Then it must have been balm
sure enough.""Nay," said the other, "it may have been blood nevertheless; for
the leech, look you, when the body was found, was commanded by the
magistrates to probe the wound with his instruments, and how could the
poor dead corpse know that that was done with good purpose?""Ay, truly, cummer; and as poor Oliver often mistook friends for enemies
while he was in life, his judgment cannot be thought to have mended
now."Dwining heard no more, being now forced upstairs into a species of
garret, where Magdalen sat on her widowed bed, clasping to her bosom
her infant, which, already black in the face and uttering the gasping,
crowing sound which gives the popular name to the complaint, seemed on
the point of rendering up its brief existence.A Dominican monk sat near
the bed, holding the other child in his arms, and seeming from time to
time to speak a word or two of spiritual consolation, or intermingle
some observation on the child's disorder.The mediciner cast upon the good father a single glance, filled
With that ineffable disdain which men of science entertain against
interlopers.His own aid was instant and efficacious: he snatched the
child from the despairing mother, stripped its throat, and opened
a vein, which, as it bled freely, relieved the little patient
instantaneously.In a brief space every dangerous symptom disappeared,
and Dwining, having bound up the vein, replaced the infant in the arms
of the half distracted mother.The poor woman's distress for her husband's loss, which had been
suspended during the extremity of the child's danger, now returned on
Magdalen with the force of an augmented torrent, which has borne down
the dam dike that for a while interrupted its waves."Oh, learned sir," she said, "you see a poor woman of her that you once
knew a richer.But the hands that restored this bairn to my arms must
not leave this house empty.Generous, kind Master Dwining, accept of
his beads; they are made of ebony and silver.He aye liked to have his
things as handsome as any gentleman, and liker he was in all his ways to
a gentleman than any one of his standing, and even so came of it."With these words, in a mute passion of grief she pressed to her breast
and to her lips the chaplet of her deceased husband, and proceeded to
thrust it into Dwining's hands."Take it," she said, "for the love of one who loved you well.Ah, he
used ever to say, if ever man could be brought back from the brink of
the grave, it must be by Master Dwining's guidance.And his ain bairn
is brought back this blessed day, and he is lying there stark and stiff,
and kens naething of its health and sickness!Oh, woe is me, and walawa!But take the beads, and think on his puir soul, as you put them through
your fingers, he will be freed from purgatory the sooner that good
people pray to assoilzie him.""Take back your beads, cummer; I know no legerdemain, can do no
conjuring tricks," said the mediciner, who, more moved than perhaps his
rugged nature had anticipated, endeavoured to avoid receiving the ill
omened gift.But his last words gave offence to the churchman, whose
presence he had not recollected when he uttered them.said the Dominican, "do you call prayers for the
dead juggling tricks?I know that Chaucer, the English maker, says of
you mediciners, that your study is but little on the Bible.Our mother,
the church, hath nodded of late, but her eyes are now opened to discern
friends from foes; and be well assured--"

"Nay, reverend father," said Dwining, "you take me at too great
advantage.I said I could do no miracles, and was about to add that,
as the church certainly could work such conclusions, those rich beads
should be deposited in your hands, to be applied as they may best
benefit the soul of the deceased."He dropped the beads into the Dominican's hand, and escaped from the
house of mourning."This was a strangely timed visit," he said to himself, when he got safe
out of doors."I hold such things cheap as any can; yet, though it is
but a silly fancy, I am glad I saved the squalling child's life.But
I must to my friend Smotherwell, whom I have no doubt to bring to my
purpose in the matter of Bonthron; and thus on this occasion I shall
save two lives, and have destroyed only one."where he lies embalmed in gore,
     His wound to Heaven cries:
     The floodgates of his blood implore
     For vengeance from the skies.John in Perth, being that of the patron saint
of the burgh, had been selected by the magistrates as that in which
the community was likely to have most fair play for the display of the
ordeal.The churches and convents of the Dominicans, Carthusians, and
others of the regular clergy had been highly endowed by the King and
nobles, and therefore it was the universal cry of the city council
that "their ain good auld St.John," of whose good graces they thought
themselves sure, ought to be fully confided in, and preferred to the new
patrons, for whom the Dominicans, Carthusians, Carmelites, and others
had founded newer seats around the Fair City.The disputes between the
regular and secular clergy added to the jealousy which dictated this
choice of the spot in which Heaven was to display a species of miracle,
upon a direct appeal to the divine decision in a case of doubtful guilt;
and the town clerk was as anxious that the church of St.John should be
preferred as if there had been a faction in the body of saints for and
against the interests of the beautiful town of Perth.Many, therefore, were the petty intrigues entered into and disconcerted
for the purpose of fixing on the church.But the magistrates,
considering it as a matter touching in a close degree the honour of
the city, determined, with judicious confidence in the justice and
impartiality of their patron, to confide the issue to the influence of
St.It was, therefore, after high mass had been performed with the greatest
solemnity of which circumstances rendered the ceremony capable, and
after the most repeated and fervent prayers had been offered to Heaven
by the crowded assembly, that preparations were made for appealing
to the direct judgment of Heaven on the mysterious murder of the
unfortunate bonnet maker.The scene presented that effect of imposing solemnity which the rites
of the Catholic Church are so well qualified to produce.The eastern
window, richly and variously painted, streamed down a torrent of
chequered light upon the high altar.On the bier placed before it were
stretched the mortal remains of the murdered man, his arms folded on his
breast, and his palms joined together, with the fingers pointed upwards,
as if the senseless clay was itself appealing to Heaven for vengeance
against those who had violently divorced the immortal spirit from its
mangled tenement.Close to the bier was placed the throne which supported Robert of
Scotland and his brother Albany.The Prince sat upon a lower stool,
beside his father--an arrangement which occasioned some observation, as,
Albany's seat being little distinguished from that of the King, the heir
apparent, though of full age, seemed to be degraded beneath his uncle in
the sight of the assembled people of Perth.The bier was so placed as to
leave the view of the body it sustained open to the greater part of the
multitude assembled in the church.At the head of the bier stood the Knight of Kinfauns, the challenger,
and at the foot the young Earl of Crawford, as representing the
defendant.The evidence of the Duke of Rothsay in expurgation, as it
was termed, of Sir John Ramorny, had exempted him from the necessity of
attendance as a party subjected to the ordeal; and his illness served as
a reason for his remaining at home.His household, including those who,
though immediately in waiting upon Sir John, were accounted the Prince's
domestics, and had not yet received their dismissal, amounted to eight
or ten persons, most of them esteemed men of profligate habits, and who
might therefore be deemed capable, in the riot of a festival evening,
of committing the slaughter of the bonnet maker.They were drawn up in a
row on the left side of the church, and wore a species of white cassock,
resembling the dress of a penitentiary.All eyes being bent on them,
several of this band seemed so much disconcerted as to excite among the
spectators strong prepossessions of their guilt.The real murderer had
a countenance incapable of betraying him--a sullen, dark look, which
neither the feast nor wine cup could enliven, and which the peril of
discovery and death could not render dejected.We have already noticed the posture of the dead body.The face was bare,
as were the breast and arms.The rest of the corpse was shrouded in a
winding sheet of the finest linen, so that, if blood should flow from
any place which was covered, it could not fail to be instantly manifest.High mass having been performed, followed by a solemn invocation to the
Deity, that He would be pleased to protect the innocent, and make known
the guilty, Eviot, Sir John Ramorny's page, was summoned to undergo the
ordeal.Perhaps he thought his
internal consciousness that Bonthron must have been the assassin might
be sufficient to implicate him in the murder, though he was not directly
accessory to it.He paused before the bier; and his voice faltered,
as he swore by all that was created in seven days and seven nights, by
heaven, by hell, by his part of paradise, and by the God and author
of all, that he was free and sackless of the bloody deed done upon the
corpse before which he stood, and on whose breast he made the sign of
the cross, in evidence of the appeal.The body
remained stiff as before, the curdled wounds gave no sign of blood.The citizens looked on each other with faces of blank disappointment.They had persuaded themselves of Eviot's guilt, and their suspicions had
been confirmed by his irresolute manner.Their surprise at his escape
was therefore extreme.The other followers of Ramorny took heart, and
advanced to take the oath with a boldness which increased as one by
one they performed the ordeal, and were declared, by the voice of
the judges, free and innocent of every suspicion attaching to them on
account of the death of Oliver Proudfute.But there was one individual who did not partake that increasing
confidence.The name of "Bonthron--Bonthron!"sounded three times
through the aisles of the church; but he who owned it acknowledged the
call no otherwise than by a sort of shuffling motion with his feet, as
if he had been suddenly affected with a fit of the palsy."Speak, dog," whispered Eviot, "or prepare for a dog's death!"But the murderer's brain was so much disturbed by the sight before him,
that the judges, beholding his deportment, doubted whether to ordain him
to be dragged before the bier or to pronounce judgment in default; and
it was not until he was asked for the last time whether he would submit
to the ordeal, that he answered, with his usual brevity:

"I will not; what do I know what juggling tricks may be practised to
take a poor man's life?I offer the combat to any man who says I harmed
that dead body."And, according to usual form, he threw his glove upon the floor of the
church.Henry Smith stepped forward, amidst the murmured applauses of his fellow
citizens, which even the august presence could not entirely suppress;
and, lifting the ruffian's glove, which he placed in his bonnet, laid
down his own in the usual form, as a gage of battle."He is no match for me," growled the savage, "nor fit to lift my glove.I follow the Prince of Scotland, in attending on his master of horse."Thou follow me, caitiff!I discharge
thee from my service on the spot.Take him in hand, Smith, and beat
him as thou didst never thump anvil!The villain is both guilty and
recreant.It sickens me even to look at him; and if my royal father will
be ruled by me, he will give the parties two handsome Scottish axes, and
we will see which of them turns out the best fellow before the day is
half an hour older."This was readily assented to by the Earl of Crawford and Sir Patrick
Charteris, the godfathers of the parties, who, as the combatants were
men of inferior rank, agreed that they should fight in steel caps, buff
jackets, and with axes, and that as soon as they could be prepared for
the combat.The lists were appointed in the Skinners' Yards--a neighbouring space of
ground, occupied by the corporation from which it had the name, and
who quickly cleared a space of about thirty feet by twenty-five for
the combatants.Thither thronged the nobles, priests, and commons--all
excepting the old King, who, detesting such scenes of blood, retired
to his residence, and devolved the charge of the field upon the Earl
of Errol, Lord High Constable, to whose office it more particularly
belonged.The Duke of Albany watched the whole proceeding with a close
and wary eye.His nephew gave the scene the heedless degree of notice
which corresponded with his character.When the combatants appeared in the lists, nothing could be more
striking than the contrast betwixt the manly, cheerful countenance of
the smith, whose sparkling bright eye seemed already beaming with the
victory he hoped for, and the sullen, downcast aspect of the brutal
Bonthron, who looked as if he were some obscene bird, driven into
sunshine out of the shelter of its darksome haunts.They made oath
severally, each to the truth of his quarrel--a ceremony which Henry
Gow performed with serene and manly confidence, Bonthron with a dogged
resolution, which induced the Duke of Rothsay to say to the High
Constable: "Didst thou ever, my dear Errol, behold such a mixture of
malignity, cruelty, and I think fear, as in that fellow's countenance?""He is not comely," said the Earl, "but a powerful knave as I have
seen.""I'll gage a hogshead of wine with you, my good lord, that he loses the
day.Henry the armourer is as strong as he, and much more active; and
then look at his bold bearing!There is something in that other fellow
that is loathsome to look upon.Let them yoke presently, my dear
Constable, for I am sick of beholding him."The High Constable then addressed the widow, who, in her deep weeds, and
having her children still beside her, occupied a chair within the lists:
"Woman, do you willingly accept of this man, Henry the Smith, to do
battle as your champion in this cause?""I do--I do, most willingly," answered Magdalen Proudfute; "and may the
blessing of God and St.John give him strength and fortune, since he
strikes for the orphan and fatherless!""Then I pronounce this a fenced field of battle," said the Constable
aloud."Let no one dare, upon peril of his life, to interrupt this
combat by word, speech, or look.The trumpets flourished, and the combatants, advancing from the opposite
ends of the lists, with a steady and even pace, looked at each other
attentively, well skilled in judging from the motion of the eye the
direction in which a blow was meditated.They halted opposite to, and
within reach of, each other, and in turn made more than one feint
to strike, in order to ascertain the activity and vigilance of the
opponent.At length, whether weary of these manoeuvres, or fearing lest
in a contest so conducted his unwieldy strength would be foiled by the
activity of the smith, Bonthron heaved up his axe for a downright blow,
adding the whole strength of his sturdy arms to the weight of the weapon
in its descent.The smith, however, avoided the stroke by stepping
aside; for it was too forcible to be controlled by any guard which he
could have interposed.Ere Bonthron recovered guard, Henry struck him
a sidelong blow on the steel headpiece, which prostrated him on the
ground."Confess, or die," said the victor, placing his foot on the body of
the vanquished, and holding to his throat the point of the axe, which
terminated in a spike or poniard."I will confess," said the villain, glaring wildly upwards on the sky."Not till you have yielded," said Harry Smith."I do yield," again murmured Bonthron, and Henry proclaimed aloud that
his antagonist was defeated.The Dukes of Rothsay and Albany, the High Constable, and the Dominican
prior now entered the lists, and, addressing Bonthron, demanded if he
acknowledged himself vanquished."I do," answered the miscreant."And guilty of the murder of Oliver Proudfute?""I am; but I mistook him for another.""And whom didst thou intend to slay?""Confess, my son,
and merit thy pardon in another world for with this thou hast little
more to do.""I took the slain man," answered the discomfited combatant, "for him
whose hand has struck me down, whose foot now presses me."said the prior; "now all those who doubt the
virtue of the holy ordeal may have their eyes opened to their error.Lo,
he is trapped in the snare which he laid for the guiltless.""I scarce ever saw the man," said the smith."I never did wrong to him
or his.Ask him, an it please your reverence, why he should have thought
of slaying me treacherously.""It is a fitting question," answered the prior."Give glory where it is
due, my son, even though it is manifested by thy shame.For what reason
wouldst thou have waylaid this armourer, who says he never wronged
thee?""He had wronged him whom I served," answered Bonthron, "and I meditated
the deed by his command."Bonthron was silent for an instant, then growled out: "He is too mighty
for me to name.""Hearken, my son," said the churchman; "tarry but a brief hour, and the
mighty and the mean of this earth shall to thee alike be empty sounds.The sledge is even now preparing to drag thee to the place of execution.Therefore, son, once more I charge thee to consult thy soul's weal by
glorifying Heaven, and speaking the truth.Was it thy master, Sir John
Ramorny, that stirred thee to so foul a deed?""No," answered the prostrate villain, "it was a greater than he."And at
the same time he pointed with his finger to the Prince.said the astonished Duke of Rothsay; "do you dare to hint that
I was your instigator?""You yourself, my lord," answered the unblushing ruffian."Die in thy falsehood, accursed slave!"said the Prince; and, drawing
his sword, he would have pierced his calumniator, had not the Lord High
Constable interposed with word and action."Your Grace must forgive my discharging mine office: this caitiff must
be delivered into the hands of the executioner.He is unfit to be dealt
with by any other, much less by your Highness."noble earl," said Albany aloud, and with much real or affected
emotion, "would you let the dog pass alive from hence, to poison the
people's ears with false accusations against the Prince of Scotland?I
say, cut him to mammocks upon the spot!""Your Highness will pardon me," said the Earl of Errol; "I must protect
him till his doom is executed.""Then let him be gagged instantly," said Albany."And you, my royal
nephew, why stand you there fixed in astonishment?Call your resolution
up--speak to the prisoner--swear--protest by all that is sacred that you
knew not of this felon deed.See how the people look on each other and
whisper apart!My life on't that this lie spreads faster than any Gospel
truth.Speak to them, royal kinsman, no matter what you say, so you be
constant in denial.""What, sir," said Rothsay, starting from his pause of surprise and
mortification, and turning haughtily towards his uncle; "would you have
me gage my royal word against that of an abject recreant?Let those who
can believe the son of their sovereign, the descendant of Bruce, capable
of laying ambush for the life of a poor mechanic, enjoy the pleasure of
thinking the villain's tale true.""That will not I for one," said the smith, bluntly."I never did aught
but what was in honour towards his royal Grace the Duke of Rothsay, and
never received unkindness from him in word, look, or deed; and I cannot
think he would have given aim to such base practice.""Was it in honour that you threw his Highness from the ladder in Curfew
Street upon Fastern's [St.said Bonthron; "or think
you the favour was received kindly or unkindly?"This was so boldly said, and seemed so plausible, that it shook the
smith's opinion of the Prince's innocence."Alas, my lord," said he, looking sorrowfully towards Rothsay, "could
your Highness seek an innocent fellow's life for doing his duty by a
helpless maiden?I would rather have died in these lists than live to
hear it said of the Bruce's heir!""Thou art a good fellow, Smith," said the Prince; "but I cannot expect
thee to judge more wisely than others.Away with that convict to the
gallows, and gibbet him alive an you will, that he may speak falsehood
and spread scandal on us to the last prolonged moment of his existence!"So saying, the Prince turned away from the lists, disdaining to notice
the gloomy looks cast towards him, as the crowd made slow and reluctant
way for him to pass, and expressing neither surprise nor displeasure at
a deep, hollow murmur, or groan, which accompanied his retreat.Only a
few of his own immediate followers attended him from the field, though
various persons of distinction had come there in his train.Even the
lower class of citizens ceased to follow the unhappy Prince, whose
former indifferent reputation had exposed him to so many charges of
impropriety and levity, and around whom there seemed now darkening
suspicions of the most atrocious nature.He took his slow and thoughtful way to the church of the Dominicans; but
the ill news, which flies proverbially fast, had reached his father's
place of retirement before he himself appeared.On entering the palace
and inquiring for the King, the Duke of Rothsay was surprised to be
informed that he was in deep consultation with the Duke of Albany, who,
mounting on horseback as the Prince left the lists, had reached the
convent before him.He was about to use the privilege of his rank and
birth to enter the royal apartment, when MacLouis, the commander of
the guard of Brandanes, gave him to understand, in the most respectful
terms, that he had special instructions which forbade his admittance."Go at least, MacLouis, and let them know that I wait their pleasure,"
said the Prince."If my uncle desires to have the credit of shutting the
father's apartment against the son, it will gratify him to know that I
am attending in the outer hall like a lackey.""May it please you," said MacLouis, with hesitation, "if your Highness
would consent to retire just now, and to wait awhile in patience, I will
send to acquaint you when the Duke of Albany goes; and I doubt not that
his Majesty will then admit your Grace to his presence.At present, your
Highness must forgive me, it is impossible you can have access.""I understand you, MacLouis; but go, nevertheless, and obey my
commands."The officer went accordingly, and returned with a message that the King
was indisposed, and on the point of retiring to his private chamber;
but that the Duke of Albany would presently wait upon the Prince of
Scotland.It was, however, a full half hour ere the Duke of Albany appeared--a
period of time which Rothsay spent partly in moody silence, and
partly in idle talk with MacLouis and the Brandanes, as the levity or
irritability of his temper obtained the ascendant.At length the Duke came, and with him the lord High Constable, whose
countenance expressed much sorrow and embarrassment."Fair kinsman," said the Duke of Albany, "I grieve to say that it is
my royal brother's opinion that it will be best, for the honour of the
royal family, that your Royal Highness do restrict yourself for a time
to the seclusion of the High Constable's lodgings, and accept of the
noble Earl here present for your principal, if not sole, companion until
the scandals which have been this day spread abroad shall be refuted or
forgotten.""How is this, my lord of Errol?""Is
your house to be my jail, and is your lordship to be my jailer?""The saints forbid, my lord," said the Earl of Errol "but it is my
unhappy duty to obey the commands of your father, by considering your
Royal Highness for some time as being under my ward.""The Prince--the heir of Scotland, under the ward of the High Constable!is the blighting speech of
a convicted recreant of strength sufficient to tarnish my royal
escutcheon?""While such accusations are not refuted and denied, my kinsman," said
the Duke of Albany, "they will contaminate that of a monarch."exclaimed the Prince; "by whom are they asserted,
save by a wretch too infamous, even by his own confession, to be
credited for a moment, though a beggar's character, not a prince's, were
impeached?Fetch him hither, let the rack be shown to him; you will soon
hear him retract the calumny which he dared to assert!""The gibbet has done its work too surely to leave Bonthron sensible
to the rack," said the Duke of Albany."He has been executed an hour
since."said the Prince; "know you it looks as if
there were practice in it to bring a stain on my name?""The custom is universal, the defeated combatant in the ordeal of battle
is instantly transferred from the lists to the gallows.And yet, fair
kinsman," continued the Duke of Albany, "if you had boldly and strongly
denied the imputation, I would have judged right to keep the wretch
alive for further investigation; but as your Highness was silent, I
deemed it best to stifle the scandal in the breath of him that uttered
it."Mary, my lord, but this is too insulting!Do you, my uncle and
kinsman, suppose me guilty of prompting such an useless and unworthy
action as that which the slave confessed?""It is not for me to bandy question with your Highness, otherwise I
would ask whether you also mean to deny the scarce less unworthy, though
less bloody, attack upon the house in Couvrefew Street?Be not angry
with me, kinsman; but, indeed, your sequestering yourself for some brief
space from the court, were it only during the King's residence in this
city, where so much offence has been given, is imperiously demanded."Rothsay paused when he heard this exhortation, and, looking at the Duke
in a very marked manner, replied:

"Uncle, you are a good huntsman.You have pitched your toils with much
skill, but you would have been foiled, not withstanding, had not the
stag rushed among the nets of free will.God speed you, and may you have
the profit by this matter which your measures deserve.Say to my father,
I obey his arrest.My Lord High Constable, I wait only your pleasure to
attend you to your lodgings.Since I am to lie in ward, I could not have
desired a kinder or more courteous warden."The interview between the uncle and nephew being thus concluded, the
Prince retired with the Earl of Errol to his apartments; the citizens
whom they met in the streets passing to the further side when they
observed the Duke of Rothsay, to escape the necessity of saluting
one whom they had been taught to consider as a ferocious as well as
unprincipled libertine.The Constable's lodgings received the owner and
his princely guest, both glad to leave the streets, yet neither feeling
easy in the situation which they occupied with regard to each other
within doors.We must return to the lists after the combat had ceased, and when the
nobles had withdrawn.The crowds were now separated into two distinct
bodies.That which made the smallest in number was at the same time the
most distinguished for respectability, consisting of the better class
of inhabitants of Perth, who were congratulating the successful champion
and each other upon the triumphant conclusion to which they had brought
their feud with the courtiers.The magistrates were so much elated on
the occasion, that they entreated Sir Patrick Charteris's acceptance of
a collation in the town hall.To this Henry, the hero of the day, was of
course invited, or he was rather commanded to attend.He listened to
the summons with great embarrassment, for it may be readily believed
his heart was with Catharine Glover.But the advice of his father Simon
decided him.That veteran citizen had a natural and becoming deference
for the magistracy of the Fair City; he entertained a high estimation
of all honours which flowed from such a source, and thought that his
intended son in law would do wrong not to receive them with gratitude."Thou must not think to absent thyself from such a solemn occasion, son
Henry," was his advice."Sir Patrick Charteris is to be there himself,
and I think it will be a rare occasion for thee to gain his goodwill.It
is like he may order of thee a new suit of harness; and I myself heard
worthy Bailie Craigdallie say there was a talk of furbishing up the
city's armoury.Thou must not neglect the good trade, now that thou
takest on thee an expensive family.""Tush, father Glover," answered the embarrassed victor, "I lack no
custom; and thou knowest there is Catharine, who may wonder at my
absence, and have her ear abused once more by tales of glee maidens and
I wot not what.""Fear not for that," said the glover, "but go, like an obedient burgess,
where thy betters desire to have thee.I do not deny that it will cost
thee some trouble to make thy peace with Catharine about this duel; for
she thinks herself wiser in such matters than king and council, kirk
and canons, provost and bailies.But I will take up the quarrel with
her myself, and will so work for thee, that, though she may receive
thee tomorrow with somewhat of a chiding, it shall melt into tears and
smiles, like an April morning, that begins with a mild shower.Away with
thee, then, my son, and be constant to the time, tomorrow morning after
mass."The smith, though reluctantly, was obliged to defer to the reasoning of
his proposed father in law, and, once determined to accept the honour
destined for him by the fathers of the city, he extricated himself from
the crowd, and hastened home to put on his best apparel; in which he
presently afterwards repaired to the council house, where the ponderous
oak table seemed to bend under the massy dishes of choice Tay salmon
and delicious sea fish from Dundee, being the dainties which the fasting
season permitted, whilst neither wine, ale, nor metheglin were wanting
to wash them down.The waits, or minstrels of the burgh, played during
the repast, and in the intervals of the music one of them recited With
great emphasis a long poetical account of the battle of Blackearnside,
fought by Sir William Wallace and his redoubted captain and friend,
Thomas of Longueville, against the English general Seward--a theme
perfectly familiar to all the guests, who, nevertheless, more tolerant
than their descendants, listened as if it had all the zest of novelty.It was complimentary to the ancestor of the Knight of Kinfauns,
doubtless, and to other Perthshire families, in passages which the
audience applauded vociferously, whilst they pledged each other in
mighty draughts to the memory of the heroes who had fought by the side
of the Champion of Scotland.The health of Henry Wynd was quaffed
with repeated shouts, and the provost announced publicly, that the
magistrates were consulting how they might best invest him with some
distinguished privilege or honorary reward, to show how highly his
fellow citizens valued his courageous exertions."Nay, take it not thus, an it like your worships," said the smith, with
his usual blunt manner, "lest men say that valour must be rare in Perth
when they reward a man for fighting for the right of a forlorn widow.I am sure there are many scores of stout burghers in the town who would
have done this day's dargue as well or better than I. For, in good
sooth, I ought to have cracked yonder fellow's head piece like an
earthen pipkin--ay, and would have done it, too, if it had not been
one which I myself tempered for Sir John Ramorny.But, an the Fair
City think my service of any worth, I will conceive it far more than
acquitted by any aid which you may afford from the common good to the
support of the widow Magdalen and her poor orphans.""That may well be done," said Sir Patrick Charteris, "and yet leave the
Fair City rich enough to pay her debts to Henry Wynd, of which every man
of us is a better judge than him self, who is blinded with an unavailing
nicety, which men call modesty.And if the burgh be too poor for this,
the provost will bear his share.The Rover's golden angels have not all
taken flight yet."The beakers were now circulated, under the name of a cup of comfort to
the widow, and anon flowed around once more to the happy memory of the
murdered Oliver, now so bravely avenged.In short, it was a feast so
jovial that all agreed nothing was wanting to render it perfect but the
presence of the bonnet maker himself, whose calamity had occasioned the
meeting, and who had usually furnished the standing jest at such festive
assemblies.Had his attendance been possible, it was drily observed by
Bailie Craigdallie, he would certainly have claimed the success of the
day, and vouched himself the avenger of his own murder.At the sound of the vesper bell the company broke up, some of the graver
sort going to evening prayers, where, with half shut eyes and shining
countenances, they made a most orthodox and edifying portion of a Lenten
congregation; others to their own homes, to tell over the occurrences of
the fight and feast, for the information of the family circle; and some,
doubtless, to the licensed freedoms of some tavern, the door of which
Lent did not keep so close shut as the forms of the church required.Henry returned to the wynd, warm with the good wine and the applause of
his fellow citizens, and fell asleep to dream of perfect happiness and
Catharine Glover.We have said that, when the combat was decided, the spectators were
divided into two bodies.Of these, when the more respectable portion
attended the victor in joyous procession, much the greater number, or
what might be termed the rabble, waited upon the subdued and sentenced
Bonthron, who was travelling in a different direction, and for a very
opposite purpose.Whatever may be thought of the comparative attractions
of the house of mourning and of feasting under other circumstances,
there can be little doubt which will draw most visitors, when the
question is, whether we would witness miseries which we are not to
share, or festivities of which we are not to partake.Accordingly, the
tumbril in which the criminal was conveyed to execution was attended by
far the greater proportion of the inhabitants of Perth.A friar was seated in the same car with the murderer, to whom he did
not hesitate to repeat, under the seal of confession, the same false
asseveration which he had made upon the place of combat, which charged
the Duke of Rothsay with being director of the ambuscade by which
the unfortunate bonnet maker had suffered.The same falsehood he
disseminated among the crowd, averring, with unblushing effrontery, to
those who were nighest to the car, that he owed his death to his having
been willing to execute the Duke of Rothsay's pleasure.For a time
he repeated these words, sullenly and doggedly, in the manner of one
reciting a task, or a liar who endeavours by reiteration to obtain
a credit for his words which he is internally sensible they do not
deserve.But when he lifted up his eyes, and beheld in the distance the
black outline of a gallows, at least forty feet high, with its ladder
and its fatal cord, rising against the horizon, he became suddenly
silent, and the friar could observe that he trembled very much."Be comforted, my son," said the good priest, "you have confessed
the truth, and received absolution.Your penitence will be accepted
according to your sincerity; and though you have been a man of bloody
hands and cruel heart, yet, by the church's prayers, you shall be in due
time assoilzied from the penal fires of purgatory."These assurances were calculated rather to augment than to diminish
the terrors of the culprit, who was agitated by doubts whether the
mode suggested for his preservation from death would to a certainty be
effectual, and some suspicion whether there was really any purpose of
employing them in his favour, for he knew his master well enough to be
aware of the indifference with which he would sacrifice one who might on
some future occasion be a dangerous evidence against him.His doom, however, was sealed, and there was no escaping from it.They
slowly approached the fatal tree, which was erected on a bank by the
river's side, about half a mile from the walls of the city--a site
chosen that the body of the wretch, which was to remain food for the
carrion crows, might be seen from a distance in every direction.Here the priest delivered Bonthron to the executioner, by whom he was
assisted up the ladder, and to all appearance despatched according to
the usual forms of the law.He seemed to struggle for life for a
minute, but soon after hung still and inanimate.The executioner, after
remaining upon duty for more than half an hour, as if to permit the
last spark of life to be extinguished, announced to the admirers of such
spectacles that the irons for the permanent suspension of the carcass
not having been got ready, the concluding ceremony of disembowelling the
dead body and attaching it finally to the gibbet would be deferred till
the next morning at sunrise.Notwithstanding the early hour which he had named, Master Smotherwell
had a reasonable attendance of rabble at the place of execution, to
see the final proceedings of justice with its victim.But great was the
astonishment and resentment of these amateurs to find that the dead body
had been removed from the gibbet.They were not, however, long at a loss
to guess the cause of its disappearance.Bonthron had been the follower
of a baron whose estates lay in Fife, and was himself a native of that
province.What was more natural than that some of the Fife men, whose
boats were frequently plying on the river, should have clandestinely
removed the body of their countryman from the place of public shame?The
crowd vented their rage against Smotherwell for not completing his
job on the preceding evening; and had not he and his assistant betaken
themselves to a boat, and escaped across the Tay, they would have run
some risk of being pelted to death.The event, however, was too much in
the spirit of the times to be much wondered at.Its real cause we shall
explain in the following chapter.Let gallows gape for dogs, let men go free.Henry V.


The incidents of a narrative of this kind must be adapted to each other,
as the wards of a key must tally accurately with those of the lock to
which it belongs.The reader, however gentle, will not hold himself
obliged to rest satisfied with the mere fact that such and such
occurrences took place, which is, generally speaking, all that in
ordinary life he can know of what is passing around him; but he is
desirous, while reading for amusement, of knowing the interior movements
occasioning the course of events.This is a legitimate and reasonable
curiosity; for every man hath a right to open and examine the mechanism
of his own watch, put together for his proper use, although he is not
permitted to pry into the interior of the timepiece which, for general
information, is displayed on the town steeple.It would be, therefore, uncourteous to leave my readers under any doubt
concerning the agency which removed the assassin Bonthron from the
gallows--an event which some of the Perth citizens ascribed to the foul
fiend himself, while others were content to lay it upon the natural
dislike of Bonthron's countrymen of Fife to see him hanging on the river
side, as a spectacle dishonourable to their province.About midnight succeeding the day when the execution had taken place,
and while the inhabitants of Perth were deeply buried in slumber, three
men muffled in their cloaks, and bearing a dark lantern, descended the
alleys of a garden which led from the house occupied by Sir John Ramorny
to the banks of the Tay, where a small boat lay moored to a landing
place, or little projecting pier.The wind howled in a low and
melancholy manner through the leafless shrubs and bushes; and a pale
moon "waded," as it is termed in Scotland, amongst drifting clouds,
which seemed to threaten rain.The three individuals entered the boat
with great precaution to escape observation.One of them was a tall,
powerful man; another short and bent downwards; the third middle sized,
and apparently younger than his companions, well made, and active.They seated themselves in the
boat and unmoored it from the pier."We must let her drift with the current till we pass the bridge, where
the burghers still keep guard; and you know the proverb, 'A Perth
arrow hath a perfect flight,'" said the most youthful of the party, who
assumed the office of helmsman, and pushed the boat off from the pier;
whilst the others took the oars, which were muffled, and rowed with all
precaution till they attained the middle of the river; they then ceased
their efforts, lay upon their oars, and trusted to the steersman for
keeping her in mid channel.In this manner they passed unnoticed or disregarded beneath the stately
Gothic arches of the old bridge, erected by the magnificent patronage
of Robert Bruce in 1329, and carried away by an inundation in 1621.Although they heard the voices of a civic watch, which, since these
disturbances commenced, had been nightly maintained in that important
pass, no challenge was given; and when they were so far down the stream
as to be out of hearing of these guardians of the night, they began to
row, but still with precaution, and to converse, though in a low tone."You have found a new trade, comrade, since I left you," said one of the
rowers to the other."I left you engaged in tending a sick knight, and I
find you employed in purloining a dead body from the gallows.""A living body, so please your squirehood, Master Buncle, or else my
craft hath failed of its purpose.""So I am told, Master Pottercarrier; but, saving your clerkship, unless
you tell me your trick, I will take leave to doubt of its success.""A simple toy, Master Buncle, not likely to please a genius so acute as
that of your valiancie.This suspension of the human
body, which the vulgar call hanging, operates death by apoplexia--that
is, the blood being unable to return to the heart by the compression
of the veins, it rushes to the brain, and the man dies.Also, and as an
additional cause of dissolution, the lungs no longer receive the needful
supply of the vital air, owing to the ligature of the cord around the
thorax; and hence the patient perishes."But how is such a revulsion of blood to
the brain to be prevented, sir mediciner?"said the third person, who
was no other than Ramorny's page, Eviot."Marry, then," replied Dwining, "hang me the patient up in such fashion
that the carotid arteries shall not be compressed, and the blood will
not determine to the brain, and apoplexia will not take place; and
again, if there be no ligature around the thorax, the lungs will be
supplied with air, whether the man be hanging in the middle heaven or
standing on the firm earth.""All this I conceive," said Eviot; "but how these precautions can be
reconciled with the execution of the sentence of hanging is what my dull
brain cannot comprehend."good youth, thy valiancie hath spoiled a fair wit.Hadst thou
studied with me, thou shouldst have learned things more difficult than
this.I get me certain bandages, made of the same
substance with your young valiancie's horse girths, having especial care
that they are of a kind which will not shrink on being strained, since
that would spoil my experiment.One loop of this substance is drawn
under each foot, and returns up either side of the leg to a cincture,
with which it is united; these cinctures are connected by divers straps
down the breast and back, in order to divide the weight.And there are
sundry other conveniences for easing the patient, but the chief is this:
the straps, or ligatures, are attached to a broad steel collar, curving
outwards, and having a hook or two, for the better security of the
halter, which the friendly executioner passes around that part of the
machine, instead of applying it to the bare throat of the patient.Thus, when thrown off from the ladder, the sufferer will find himself
suspended, not by his neck, if it please you, but by the steel circle,
which supports the loops in which his feet are placed, and on which his
weight really rests, diminished a little by similar supports under each
arm.Thus, neither vein nor windpipe being compressed, the man will
breathe as free, and his blood, saving from fright and novelty of
situation, will flow as temperately as your valiancie's when you stand
up in your stirrups to view a field of battle.""By my faith, a quaint and rare device!"pursued the leech, "and well worth being known to such
mounting spirits as your valiancies, since there is no knowing to what
height Sir John Ramorny's pupils may arrive; and if these be such that
it is necessary to descend from them by a rope, you may find my mode of
management more convenient than the common practice.Marry, but you must
be provided with a high collared doublet, to conceal the ring of steel,
and, above all, such a bonus socius as Smother well to adjust the
noose.""Base poison vender," said Eviot, "men of our calling die on the field
of battle.""I will save the lesson, however," replied Buncle, "in case of some
pinching occasion.But what a night the bloody hangdog Bonthron must
have had of it, dancing a pavise in mid air to the music of his own
shackles, as the night wind swings him that way and this!""It were an alms deed to leave him there," said Eviot; "for his descent
from the gibbet will but encourage him to new murders.He knows but two
elements--drunkenness and bloodshed.""Perhaps Sir John Ramorny might have been of your opinion," said
Dwining; "but it would first have been necessary to cut out the rogue's
tongue, lest he had told strange tales from his airy height.And there
are other reasons that it concerns not your valiancies to know.In
truth, I myself have been generous in serving him, for the fellow is
built as strong as Edinburgh Castle, and his anatomy would have matched
any that is in the chirurgical hall of Padua.But tell me, Master
Buncle, what news bring you from the doughty Douglas?""They may tell that know," said Buncle."I am the dull ass that bears
the message, and kens nought of its purport.I carried letters from the Duke of Albany and from Sir John
Ramorny to the Douglas, and he looked black as a northern tempest when
he opened them.I brought them answers from the Earl, at which they
smiled like the sun when the harvest storm is closing over him.Go to
your ephemerides, leech, and conjure the meaning out of that.""Methinks I can do so without much cost of wit," said the chirurgeon;
"but yonder I see in the pale moonlight our dead alive.Should he have
screamed out to any chance passenger, it were a curious interruption
to a night journey to be hailed from the top of such a gallows as that.Hark, methinks I do hear his groans amid the whistling of the wind and
the creaking of the chains.So--fair and softly; make fast the boat
with the grappling, and get out the casket with my matters, we would be
better for a little fire, but the light might bring observation on
us.Come on, my men of valour, march warily, for we are bound for the
gallows foot.Follow with the lantern; I trust the ladder has been left."Sing, three merry men, and three merry men,
     And three merry men are we,
     Thou on the land, and I on the sand,
     And Jack on the gallows tree."As they advanced to the gibbet, they could plainly hear groans, though
uttered in a low tone.Dwining ventured to give a low cough once or
twice, by way of signal; but receiving no answer, "We had best make
haste," said he to his companions, "for our friend must be in extremis,
as he gives no answer to the signal which announces the arrival of help.I will go up the ladder first and cut the
rope.Do you two follow, one after another, and take fast hold of the
body, so that he fall not when the halter is unloosed.Keep sure gripe,
for which the bandages will afford you convenience.Bethink you that,
though he plays an owl's part tonight, he hath no wings, and to fall out
of a halter may be as dangerous as to fall into one."While he spoke thus with sneer and gibe, he ascended the ladder, and
having ascertained that the men at arms who followed him had the body in
their hold, he cut the rope, and then gave his aid to support the almost
lifeless form of the criminal.By a skilful exertion of strength and address, the body of Bonthron was
placed safely on the ground; and the faint yet certain existence of life
having been ascertained, it was thence transported to the river side,
where, shrouded by the bank, the party might be best concealed from
observation, while the leech employed himself in the necessary means of
recalling animation, with which he had taken care to provide himself.For this purpose he first freed the recovered person from his shackles,
which the executioner had left unlocked on purpose, and at the same time
disengaged the complicated envelopes and bandages by which he had been
suspended.It was some time ere Dwining's efforts succeeded; for, in
despite of the skill with which his machine had been constructed, the
straps designed to support the body had stretched so considerably as to
occasion the sense of suffocation becoming extremely overpowering.But
the address of the surgeon triumphed over all obstacles; and, after
sneezing and stretching himself, with one or two brief convulsions,
Bonthron gave decided proofs of reanimation, by arresting the hand
of the operator as it was in the act of dropping strong waters on his
breast and throat, and, directing the bottle which contained them to his
lips, he took, almost perforce, a considerable gulp of the contents."It is spiritual essence double distilled," said the astonished
operator, "and would blister the throat and burn the stomach of any
other man.But this extraordinary beast is so unlike all other human
creatures, that I should not wonder if it brought him to the complete
possession of his faculties."Bonthron seemed to confirm this: he started with a strong convulsion,
sat up, stared around, and indicated some consciousness of existence."Wine--wine," were the first words which he articulated.The leech gave him a draught of medicated wine, mixed with water.He
rejected it, under the dishonourable epithet of "kennel washings," and
again uttered the words, "Wine--wine.""Nay, take it to thee, i' the devil's name," said the leech, "since none
but he can judge of thy constitution."A draught, long and deep enough to have discomposed the intellects of
any other person, was found effectual in recalling those of Bonthron to
a more perfect state; though he betrayed no recollection of where he was
or what had befallen him, and in his brief and sullen manner asked why
he was brought to the river side at this time of night."Another frolic of the wild Prince, for drenching me as he did before.Nails and blood, but I would--"

"Hold thy peace," interrupted Eviot, "and be thankful, I pray you, if
you have any thankfulness in you, that thy body is not crow's meat and
thy soul in a place where water is too scarce to duck thee.""I begin to bethink me," said the ruffian; and raising the flask to his
mouth, which he saluted with a long and hearty kiss, he set the empty
bottle on the earth, dropped his head on his bosom, and seemed to muse
for the purpose of arranging his confused recollections."We can abide the issue of his meditations no longer," said Dwining; "he
will be better after he has slept.you have been riding the air
these some hours; try if the water be not an easier mode of conveyance.I can no more lift this mass than I
could raise in my arms a slaughtered bull.""Stand upright on thine own feet, Bonthron, now we have placed thee upon
them," said Eviot."Every drop of blood tingles in my
veins as if it had pinpoints, and my knees refuse to bear their burden.This is some practice of thine,
thou dog leech!""Ay--ay, so it is, honest Bonthron," said Dwining--"a practice thou
shalt thank me for when thou comest to learn it.In the mean while,
stretch down in the stern of that boat, and let me wrap this cloak about
thee."Assisted into the boat accordingly, Bonthron was deposited there as
conveniently as things admitted of.He answered their attentions with
one or two snorts resembling the grunt of a boar who has got some food
particularly agreeable to him."And now, Buncle," said the chirurgeon, "your valiant squireship
knows your charge.You are to carry this lively cargo by the river to
Newburgh, where you are to dispose of him as you wot of; meantime,
here are his shackles and bandages, the marks of his confinement and
liberation.Bind them up together, and fling them into the deepest pool
you pass over; for, found in your possession, they might tell tales
against us all.This low, light breath of wind from the west will permit
you to use a sail as soon as the light comes in and you are tired of
rowing.Your other valiancie, Master Page Eviot, must be content to
return to Perth with me afoot, for here severs our fair company.Take
with thee the lantern, Buncle, for thou wilt require it more than we,
and see thou send me back my flasket."As the pedestrians returned to Perth, Eviot expressed his belief that
Bonthron's understanding would never recover the shock which terror had
inflicted upon it, and which appeared to him to have disturbed all the
faculties of his mind, and in particular his memory."It is not so, an it please your pagehood," said the leech."Bonthron's
intellect, such as it is, hath a solid character: it Will but vacillate
to and fro like a pendulum which hath been put in motion, and then will
rest in its proper point of gravity.Our memory is, of all our powers of
mind, that which is peculiarly liable to be suspended.Deep intoxication
or sound sleep alike destroy it, and yet it returns when the drunkard
becomes sober or the sleeper is awakened.I knew at Paris a criminal condemned to die by the halter,
who suffered the sentence accordingly, showing no particular degree of
timidity upon the scaffold, and behaving and expressing himself as men
in the same condition are wont to do.Accident did for him what a little
ingenious practice hath done for our amiable friend from whom we but
now parted.He was cut down and given to his friends before life was
extinct, and I had the good fortune to restore him.But, though he
recovered in other particulars, he remembered but little of his trial
and sentence.Of his confession on the morning of his execution--he!(in his usual chuckling manner)--he remembered him not a word.Neither of leaving the prison, nor of his passage to the Greve, where
he suffered, nor of the devout speeches with which he--he!he!--so many good Christians, nor of ascending the
fatal tree, nor of taking the fatal leap, had my revenant the slightest
recollection.'But here we reach the point where we must separate;
for it were unfit, should we meet any of the watch, that we be found
together, and it were also prudent that we enter the city by different
gates.My profession forms an excuse for my going and coming at all
times.Your valiant pagehood will make such explanation as may seem
sufficing.""I shall make my will a sufficient excuse if I am interrogated," said
the haughty young man."Yet I will avoid interruption, if possible.The
moon is quite obscured, and the road as black as a wolf's mouth.""Tut," said the physicianer, "let not your valour care for that: we
shall tread darker paths ere it be long."Without inquiring into the meaning of these evil boding sentences, and
indeed hardly listening to them in the pride and recklessness of his
nature, the page of Ramorny parted from his ingenious and dangerous
companion, and each took his own way.The course of true love never did run smooth.The ominous anxiety of our armourer had not played him false.When the
good glover parted with his intended son in law, after the judicial
combat had been decided, he found what he indeed had expected, that his
fair daughter was in no favourable disposition towards her lover.But
although he perceived that Catharine was cold, restrained, collected,
had cast away the appearance of mortal passion, and listened with a
reserve, implying contempt, to the most splendid description he could
give her of the combat in the Skinners' Yards, he was determined not
to take the least notice of her altered manner, but to speak of her
marriage with his son Henry as a thing which must of course take place.At length, when she began, as on a former occasion, to intimate that her
attachment to the armourer did not exceed the bounds of friendship, that
she was resolved never to marry, that the pretended judicial combat
was a mockery of the divine will, and of human laws, the glover not
unnaturally grew angry."I cannot read thy thoughts, wench; nor can I pretend to guess under
what wicked delusion it is that you kiss a declared lover, suffer him
to kiss you, run to his house when a report is spread of his death, and
fling yourself into his arms when you find him alone [alive].All
this shows very well in a girl prepared to obey her parents in a match
sanctioned by her father; but such tokens of intimacy, bestowed on one
whom a young woman cannot esteem, and is determined not to marry, are
uncomely and unmaidenly.You have already been more bounteous of your
favours to Henry Smith than your mother, whom God assoilzie, ever was to
me before I married her.I tell thee, Catharine, this trifling with the
love of an honest man is what I neither can, will, nor ought to endure.I have given my consent to the match, and I insist it shall take place
without delay, and that you receive Henry Wynd tomorrow, as a man whose
bride you are to be with all despatch.""A power more potent than yours, father, will say no," replied
Catharine."I will risk it; my power is a lawful one, that of a father over a
child, and an erring child," answered her father."God and man allow of
my influence.""Then, may Heaven help us," said Catharine; "for, if you are obstinate
in your purpose, we are all lost.""We can expect no help from Heaven," said the glover, "when we act
with indiscretion.I am clerk enough myself to know that; and that your
causeless resistance to my will is sinful, every priest will inform
you.Ay, and more than that, you have spoken degradingly of the blessed
appeal to God in the combat of ordeal.for the Holy Church
is awakened to watch her sheepfold, and to extirpate heresy by fire and
steel; so much I warn thee of."Catharine uttered a suppressed exclamation; and, with difficulty
compelling herself to assume an appearance of composure, promised her
father that, if he would spare her any farther discussion of the subject
till tomorrow morning, she would then meet him, determined to make a
full discovery of her sentiments.With this promise Simon Glover was obliged to remain contented, though
extremely anxious for the postponed explanation.It could not be levity
or fickleness of character which induced his daughter to act with so
much apparent inconsistency towards the man of his choice, and whom she
had so lately unequivocally owned to be also the man of her own.What
external force there could exist, of a kind powerful enough to change
the resolutions she had so decidedly expressed within twenty-four hours,
was a matter of complete mystery."But I will be as obstinate as she can be," thought the glover, "and she
shall either marry Henry Smith without farther delay or old Simon Glover
will know an excellent reason to the contrary."The subject was not renewed during the evening; but early on the next
morning, just at sun rising, Catharine knelt before the bed in which her
parent still slumbered.Her heart sobbed as if it would burst, and her
tears fell thick upon her father's face.The good old man awoke, looked
up, crossed his child's forehead, and kissed her affectionately."I understand thee, Kate," he said; "thou art come to confession, and, I
trust, art desirous to escape a heavy penance by being sincere.""I need not ask, my father, if you remember the Carthusian monk,
Clement, and his preachings and lessons; at which indeed you assisted so
often, that you cannot be ignorant men called you one of his converts,
and with greater justice termed me so likewise?""I am aware of both," said the old man, raising himself on his elbow;
"but I defy foul fame to show that I ever owned him in any heretical
proposition, though I loved to hear him talk of the corruptions of the
church, the misgovernment of the nobles, and the wild ignorance of
the poor, proving, as it seemed to me, that the sole virtue of our
commonweal, its strength and its estimation, lay among the burgher
craft of the better class, which I received as comfortable doctrine, and
creditable to the town.And if he preached other than right doctrine,
wherefore did his superiors in the Carthusian convent permit it?If the
shepherds turn a wolf in sheep's clothing into the flock, they should
not blame the sheep for being worried.""They endured his preaching, nay, they encouraged it," said Catharine,
"while the vices of the laity, the contentions of the nobles, and
the oppression of the poor were the subject of his censure, and they
rejoiced in the crowds who, attracted to the Carthusian church,
forsook those of the other convents.But the hypocrites--for such they
are--joined with the other fraternities in accusing their preacher
Clement, when, passing from censuring the crimes of the state, he
began to display the pride, ignorance, and luxury of the churchmen
themselves--their thirst of power, their usurpation over men's
consciences, and their desire to augment their worldly wealth.""For God's sake, Catharine," said her father, "speak within doors: your
voice rises in tone and your speech in bitterness, your eyes sparkle.It is owing to this zeal in what concerns you no more than others
that malicious persons fix upon you the odious and dangerous name of a
heretic.""You know I speak no more than what is truth," said Catharine, "and
which you yourself have avouched often.""Wouldst
thou have me avouch what might cost me life and limb, land and goods?For a full commission hath been granted for taking and trying heretics,
upon whom is laid the cause of all late tumults and miscarriages;
wherefore, few words are best, wench.I am ever of mind with the old
maker:

"Since word is thrall and thought is free, Keep well thy tongue, I
counsel thee.""The counsel comes too late, father," answered Catharine, sinking down
on a chair by her father's bedside."The words have been spoken and
heard; and it is indited against Simon Glover, burgess in Perth, that he
hath spoken irreverent discourses of the doctrines of Holy Church.""As I live by knife and needle," interrupted Simon, "it is a lie!I
never was so silly as to speak of what I understood not.""And hath slandered the anointed of the church, both regular and
secular," continued Catharine."Nay, I will never deny the truth," said the glover: "an idle word I may
have spoken at the ale bench, or over a pottle pot of wine, or in right
sure company; but else, my tongue is not one to run my head into peril.""So you think, my dearest father; but your slightest language has been
espied, your best meaning phrases have been perverted, and you are in
dittay as a gross railer against church and churchmen, and for holding
discourse against them with loose and profligate persons, such as the
deceased Oliver Proudfute, the smith Henry of the Wynd, and others, set
forth as commending the doctrines of Father Clement, whom they charge
with seven rank heresies, and seek for with staff and spear, to try him
to the death.But that," said Catharine, kneeling, and looking upwards
with the aspect of one of those beauteous saints whom the Catholics have
given to the fine arts--"that they shall never do.He hath escaped from
the net of the fowler; and, I thank Heaven, it was by my means.""Thy means, girl--art thou mad?""I will not deny what I glory in," answered Catharine: "it was by my
means that Conachar was led to come hither with a party of men and carry
off the old man, who is now far beyond the Highland line.""Thou my rash--my unlucky child!"said the glover, "hast dared to aid
the escape of one accused of heresy, and to invite Highlanders in arms
to interfere with the administration of justice within burgh?thou hast offended both against the laws of the church and those of the
realm.What--what would become of us, were this known?""It is known, my dear father," said the maiden, firmly--"known even to
those who will be the most willing avengers of the deed.""This must be some idle notion, Catharine, or some trick of those
cogging priests and nuns; it accords not with thy late cheerful
willingness to wed Henry Smith."dearest father, remember the dismal surprise occasioned by his
reported death, and the joyful amazement at finding him alive; and deem
it not wonder if I permitted myself, under your protection, to say more
than my reflection justified.But then I knew not the worst, and thought
the danger exaggerated.Alas I was yesterday fearfully undeceived, when
the abbess herself came hither, and with her the Dominican.They showed
me the commission, under the broad seal of Scotland, for inquiring into
and punishing heresy; they showed me your name and my own in a list of
suspected persons; and it was with tears--real tears, that the abbess
conjured me to avert a dreadful fate by a speedy retreat into the
cloister, and that the monk pledged his word that you should not be
molested if I complied.""The foul fiend take them both for weeping crocodiles!"replied Catharine, "complaint or anger will little help us; but
you see I have had real cause for this present alarm."my reckless child, where was your
prudence when you ran headlong into such a snare?""Hear me, father," said Catharine; "there is still one mode of safety
held out: it is one which I have often proposed, and for which I have in
vain supplicated your permission.""I understand you--the convent," said her father."But, Catharine, what
abbess or prioress would dare--"

"That I will explain to you, father, and it will also show the
circumstances which have made me seem unsteady of resolution to a
degree which has brought censure upon me from yourself and others.Our
confessor, old Father Francis, whom I chose from the Dominican convent
at your command--"

"Ay, truly," interrupted the glover; "and I so counselled and commanded
thee, in order to take off the report that thy conscience was altogether
under the direction of Father Clement.""Well, this Father Francis has at different times urged and provoked me
to converse on such matters as he judged I was likely to learn something
of from the Carthusian preacher.I fell
into the snare, spoke freely, and, as he argued gently, as one who would
fain be convinced, I even spoke warmly in defence of what I believed
devoutly.The confessor assumed not his real aspect and betrayed not his
secret purpose until he had learned all that I had to tell him.It was
then that he threatened me with temporal punishment and with eternal
condemnation.Had his threats reached me alone, I could have stood firm;
for their cruelty on earth I could have endured, and their power beyond
this life I have no belief in."said the glover, who was well nigh beside himself
at perceiving at every new word the increasing extremity of his
daughter's danger, "beware of blaspheming the Holy Church, whose arms
are as prompt to strike as her ears are sharp to hear.""To me," said the Maid of Perth, again looking up, "the terrors of the
threatened denunciations would have been of little avail; but when they
spoke of involving thee, my father, in the charge against me, I own
I trembled, and desired to compromise.The Abbess Martha, of Elcho
nunnery, being my mother's kinswoman, I told her my distresses, and
obtained her promise that she would receive me, if, renouncing worldly
love and thoughts of wedlock, I would take the veil in her sisterhood.She had conversation on the topic, I doubt not, with the Dominican
Francis, and both joined in singing the same song."'Remain in the world,' said they, 'and thy father and thou shall be
brought to trial as heretics; assume the veil, and the errors of both
shall be forgiven and cancelled.'They spoke not even of recantation
of errors of doctrine: all should be peace if I would but enter the
convent.""I doubt not--I doubt not," said Simon: "the old glover is thought rich,
and his wealth would follow his daughter to the convent of Elcho, unless
what the Dominicans might claim as their own share.So this was thy call
to the veil, these thy objections to Henry Wynd?""Indeed, father, the course was urged on all hands, nor did my own
mind recoil from it.Sir John Ramorny threatened me with the powerful
vengeance of the young Prince, if I continued to repel his wicked suit;
and as for poor Henry, it is but of late that I have discovered, to
my own surprise--that--that I love his virtues more than I dislike his
faults.the discovery has only been made to render my quitting the
world more difficult than when I thought I had thee only to regret."She rested her head on her hand and wept bitterly."All this is folly," said the glover."Never was there an extremity so
pinching, but what a wise man might find counsel if he was daring enough
to act upon it.This has never been the land or the people over whom
priests could rule in the name of Rome, without their usurpation being
controlled.If they are to punish each honest burgher who says the
monks love gold, and that the lives of some of them cry shame upon the
doctrines they teach, why, truly, Stephen Smotherwell will not lack
employment; and if all foolish maidens are to be secluded from the world
because they follow the erring doctrines of a popular preaching friar,
they must enlarge the nunneries and receive their inmates on slighter
composition.Our privileges have been often defended against the Pope
himself by our good monarchs of yore, and when he pretended to interfere
with the temporal government of the kingdom, there wanted not a Scottish
Parliament who told him his duty in a letter that should have been
written in letters of gold.I have seen the epistle myself, and though
I could not read it, the very sight of the seals of the right reverend
prelates and noble and true barons which hung at it made my heart leap
for joy.Thou shouldst not have kept this secret, my child--but it is no
time to tax thee with thy fault.I will mount
instantly, and go to our Lord Provost and have his advice, and, as I
trust, his protection and that of other true hearted Scottish nobles,
who will not see a true man trodden down for an idle word."my father," said Catharine, "it was even this impetuosity which I
dreaded.I knew if I made my plaint to you there would soon be fire and
feud, as if religion, though sent to us by the Father of peace, were fit
only to be the mother of discord; and hence I could now--even now--give
up the world, and retire with my sorrow among the sisters of Elcho,
would you but let me be the sacrifice.Only, father--comfort poor Henry
when we are parted for ever; and do not--do not let him think of me too
harshly.Say Catharine will never vex him more by her remonstrances, but
that she will never forget him in her prayers.""The girl hath a tongue that would make a Saracen weep," said her
father, his own eyes sympathising with those of his daughter."But I
will not yield way to this combination between the nun and the priest to
rob me of my only child.Away with you, girl, and let me don my clothes;
and prepare yourself to obey me in what I may have to recommend for your
safety.Get a few clothes together, and what valuables thou hast; also,
take the keys of my iron box, which poor Henry Smith gave me, and divide
what gold you find into two portions; put the one into a purse for
thyself, and the other into the quilted girdle which I made on purpose
to wear on journeys.Thus both shall be provided, in case fate should
sunder us; in which event, God send the whirlwind may take the withered
leaf and spare the green one!Let them make ready my horse instantly,
and the white jennet that I bought for thee but a day since, hoping to
see thee ride to St.John's Kirk with maids and matrons, as blythe a
bride as ever crossed the holy threshold.Away, and remember that the saints help those who are willing to help
themselves.Not a word in answer; begone, I say--no wilfullness now.The
pilot in calm weather will let a sea boy trifle with the rudder; but, by
my soul, when winds howl and waves arise, he stands by the helm himself.Catharine left the room to execute, as well as she might, the commands
of her father, who, gentle in disposition and devotedly attached to his
child, suffered her often, as it seemed, to guide and rule both herself
and him; yet who, as she knew, was wont to claim filial obedience and
exercise parental authority with sufficient strictness when the occasion
seemed to require an enforcement of domestic discipline.While the fair Catharine was engaged in executing her father's behests,
and the good old glover was hastily attiring himself, as one who was
about to take a journey, a horse's tramp was heard in the narrow street.The horseman was wrapped in his riding cloak, having the cape of it
drawn up, as if to hide the under part of his face, while his bonnet was
pulled over his brows, and a broad plume obscured his upper features.He sprung from the saddle, and Dorothy had scarce time to reply to
his inquiries that the glover was in his bedroom, ere the stranger had
ascended the stair and entered the sleeping apartment.Simon, astonished
and alarmed, and disposed to see in this early visitant an apparitor or
sumner come to attach him and his daughter, was much relieved when, as
the stranger doffed the bonnet and threw the skirt of the mantle from
his face, he recognised the knightly provost of the Fair City, a visit
from whom at any time was a favour of no ordinary degree, but, being
made at such an hour, had something marvellous, and, connected with the
circumstances of the times, even alarming."This high honour done to your
poor beadsman--"

"Hush!"said the knight, "there is no time for idle civilities.I came
hither because a man is, in trying occasions, his own safest page, and
I can remain no longer than to bid thee fly, good glover, since warrants
are to be granted this day in council for the arrest of thy daughter and
thee, under charge of heresy; and delay will cost you both your liberty
for certain, and perhaps your lives.""I have heard something of such a matter," said the glover, "and was
this instant setting forth to Kinfauns to plead my innocence of this
scandalous charge, to ask your lordship's counsel, and to implore your
protection.""Thy innocence, friend Simon, will avail thee but little before
prejudiced judges; my advice is, in one word, to fly, and wait for
happier times.As for my protection, we must tarry till the tide turns
ere it will in any sort avail thee.But if thou canst lie concealed for
a few days or weeks, I have little doubt that the churchmen, who, by
siding with the Duke of Albany in court intrigue, and by alleging
the decay of the purity of Catholic doctrine as the sole cause of the
present national misfortunes, have, at least for the present hour, an
irresistible authority over the King, will receive a check.In the mean
while, however, know that King Robert hath not only given way to this
general warrant for inquisition after heresy, but hath confirmed the
Pope's nomination of Henry Wardlaw to be Archbishop of St.Andrews and
Primate of Scotland; thus yielding to Rome those freedoms and immunities
of the Scottish Church which his ancestors, from the time of Malcolm
Canmore, have so boldly defended.His brave fathers would have rather
subscribed a covenant with the devil than yielded in such a matter to
the pretensions of Rome.""None, old man, save in some sudden court change," said Sir Patrick."The King is but like a mirror, which, having no light itself, reflects
back with equal readiness any which is placed near to it for the
time.Now, although the Douglas is banded with Albany, yet the Earl is
unfavourable to the high claims of those domineering priests, having
quarrelled with them about the exactions which his retinue hath raised
on the Abbot of Arbroath.He will come back again with a high hand, for
report says the Earl of March hath fled before him.When he returns
we shall have a changed world, for his presence will control Albany;
especially as many nobles, and I myself, as I tell you in confidence,
are resolved to league with him to defend the general right.Thy exile,
therefore, will end with his return to our court.Thou hast but to seek
thee some temporary hiding place.""For that, my lord," said the glover, "I can be at no loss, since I
have just title to the protection of the high Highland chief, Gilchrist
MacIan, chief of the Clan Quhele.""Nay, if thou canst take hold of his mantle thou needs no help of any
one else: neither Lowland churchman nor layman finds a free course of
justice beyond the Highland frontier.""But then my child, noble sir--my Catharine?"The graddan cake will keep her white teeth
in order, the goat's whey will make the blood spring to her cheek again,
which these alarms have banished and even the Fair Maiden of Perth may
sleep soft enough on a bed of Highland breckan.""It is not from such idle respects, my lord, that I hesitate," said the
glover."Catharine is the daughter of a plain burgher, and knows not
nicety of food or lodging.But the son of MacIan hath been for many
years a guest in my house, and I am obliged to say that I have observed
him looking at my daughter, who is as good as a betrothed bride, in a
manner that, though I cared not for it in this lodging in Curfew Street,
would give me some fear of consequences in a Highland glen, where I have
no friend and Conachar many."The knightly provost replied by a long whistle.Nay, in
that case, I advise thee to send her to the nunnery at Elcho, where the
abbess, if I forget not, is some relation of yours.Indeed, she said so
herself, adding, that she loved her kinswoman well, together with all
that belongs to thee, Simon.""Truly, my lord, I do believe that the abbess hath so much regard for
me, that she would willingly receive the trust of my daughter, and
my whole goods and gear, into her sisterhood.Marry, her affection is
something of a tenacious character, and would be loth to unloose its
hold, either upon the wench or her tocher."again whistled the Knight of Kinfauns; "by the Thane's
Cross, man, but this is an ill favoured pirn to wind: Yet it shall never
be said the fairest maid in the Fair City was cooped up in a convent,
like a kain hen in a cavey, and she about to be married to the bold
burgess Henry Wynd.That tale shall not be told while I wear belt and
spurs, and am called Provost of Perth.""We must all take our share of the risk.Come, get you and your daughter
presently to horse.You shall ride with me, and we'll see who dare
gloom at you.The summons is not yet served on thee, and if they send
an apparitor to Kinfauns without a warrant under the King's own hand,
I make mine avow, by the Red Rover's soul!that he shall eat his
writ, both wax and wether skin.and," addressing
Catharine, as she entered at the moment, "you too, my pretty maid--

"To horse, and fear not for your quarters; They thrive in law that trust
in Charters."In a minute or two the father and daughter were on horseback, both
keeping an arrow's flight before the provost, by his direction, that
they might not seem to be of the same company.They passed the eastern
gate in some haste, and rode forward roundly until they were out of
sight.Sir Patrick followed leisurely; but, when he was lost to the view
of the warders, he spurred his mettled horse, and soon came up with the
glover and Catharine, when a conversation ensued which throws light upon
some previous passages of this history.seed of those who scorn'd
     To stoop the neck to wide imperial Rome--
     Oh, dearest half of Albion sea walled!"I have been devising a mode," said the well meaning provost, "by which
I may make you both secure for a week or two from the malice of your
enemies, when I have little doubt I may see a changed world at court.But that I may the better judge what is to be done, tell me frankly,
Simon, the nature of your connexion with Gilchrist MacIan, which leads
you to repose such implicit confidence in him.You are a close observer
of the rules of the city, and are aware of the severe penalties which
they denounce against such burghers as have covine and alliance with the
Highland clans.""True, my lord; but it is also known to you that our craft, working in
skins of cattle, stags, and every other description of hides, have a
privilege, and are allowed to transact with those Highlanders, as with
the men who can most readily supply us with the means of conducting our
trade, to the great profit of the burgh.Thus it hath chanced with me to
have great dealings with these men; and I can take it on my salvation,
that you nowhere find more just and honourable traffickers, or by whom a
man may more easily make an honest penny.I have made in my day several
distant journeys into the far Highlands, upon the faith of their chiefs;
nor did I ever meet with a people more true to their word, when you
can once prevail upon them to plight it in your behalf.And as for the
Highland chief, Gilchrist MacIan, saving that he is hasty in homicide
and fire raising towards those with whom he hath deadly feud, I have
nowhere seen a man who walketh a more just and upright path.""It is more than ever I heard before," said Sir Patrick Charteris."Yet
I have known something of the Highland runagates too.""They show another favour, and a very different one, to their friends
than to their enemies, as your lordship shall understand," said the
glover."However, be that as it may, it chanced me to serve Gilchrist
MacIan in a high matter.It is now about eighteen years since, that it
chanced, the Clan Quhele and Clan Chattan being at feud, as indeed they
are seldom at peace, the former sustained such a defeat as well nigh
extirpated the family of their chief MacIan.Seven of his sons were
slain in battle and after it, himself put to flight, and his castle
taken and given to the flames.His wife, then near the time of giving
birth to an infant, fled into the forest, attended by one faithful
servant and his daughter.Here, in sorrow and care enough, she gave
birth to a boy; and as the misery of the mother's condition rendered her
little able to suckle the infant, he was nursed with the milk of a doe,
which the forester who attended her contrived to take alive in a snare.It was not many months afterwards that, in a second encounter of these
fierce clans, MacIan defeated his enemies in his turn, and regained
possession of the district which he had lost.It was with unexpected
rapture that he found his wife and child were in existence, having never
expected to see more of them than the bleached bones, from which the
wolves and wildcats had eaten the flesh."But a strong and prevailing prejudice, such as is often entertained
by these wild people, prevented their chief from enjoying the full
happiness arising from having thus regained his only son in safety.An
ancient prophecy was current among them, that the power of the tribe
should fall by means of a boy born under a bush of holly and suckled
by a white doe.The circumstance, unfortunately for the chief, tallied
exactly with the birth of the only child which remained to him, and it
was demanded of him by the elders of the clan, that the boy should be
either put to death or at least removed from the dominions of the tribe
and brought up in obscurity.Gilchrist MacIan was obliged to consent and
having made choice of the latter proposal, the child, under the name of
Conachar, was brought up in my family, with the purpose, as was at first
intended, of concealing from him all knowledge who or what he was, or of
his pretensions to authority over a numerous and warlike people.But,
as years rolled on, the elders of the tribe, who had exerted so much
authority, were removed by death, or rendered incapable of interfering
in the public affairs by age; while, on the other hand, the influence of
Gilchrist MacIan was increased by his successful struggles against
the Clan Chattan, in which he restored the equality betwixt the two
contending confederacies, which had existed before the calamitous defeat
of which I told your honour.Feeling himself thus firmly seated, he
naturally became desirous to bring home his only son to his bosom and
family; and for that purpose caused me to send the young Conachar, as
he was called, more than once to the Highlands.He was a youth expressly
made, by his form and gallantry of bearing, to gain a father's heart.At length, I suppose the lad either guessed the secret of his birth
or something of it was communicated to him; and the disgust which the
paughty Hieland varlet had always shown for my honest trade became more
manifest; so that I dared not so much as lay my staff over his costard,
for fear of receiving a stab with a dirk, as an answer in Gaelic to
a Saxon remark.It was then that I wished to be well rid of him, the
rather that he showed so much devotion to Catharine, who, forsooth, set
herself up to wash the Ethiopian, and teach a wild Hielandmnan mercy and
morals."Nay, my father," said Catharine, "it was surely but a point of charity
to snatch the brand from the burning.""But a small point of wisdom," said her father, "to risk the burning of
your own fingers for such an end."My lord would not offend the Fair Maid of Perth," said Sir Patrick;
"and he knows well the purity and truth of her mind.And yet I must
needs say that, had this nursling of the doe been shrivelled, haggard,
cross made, and red haired, like some Highlanders I have known, I
question if the Fair Maiden of Perth would have bestowed so much zeal
upon his conversion; and if Catharine had been as aged, wrinkled, and
bent by years as the old woman that opened the door for me this morning,
I would wager my gold spurs against a pair of Highland brogues that this
wild roebuck would never have listened to a second lecture.You laugh,
glover, and Catharine blushes a blush of anger.Let it pass, it is the
way of the world.""The way in which the men of the world esteem their neighbours, my
lord," answered Catharine, with some spirit."Nay, fair saint, forgive a jest," said the knight; "and thou, Simon,
tell us how this tale ended--with Conachar's escape to the Highlands, I
suppose?""With his return thither," said the glover."There was, for some two
or three years, a fellow about Perth, a sort of messenger, who came
and went under divers pretences, but was, in fact, the means of
communication between Gilchrist MacIan and his son, young Conachar, or,
as he is now called, Hector.From this gillie I learned, in general,
that the banishment of the dault an neigh dheil, or foster child of
the white doe, was again brought under consideration of the tribe.His
foster father, Torquil of the Oak, the old forester, appeared with
eight sons, the finest men of the clan, and demanded that the doom of
banishment should be revoked.He spoke with the greater authority, as
he was himself taishatar, or a seer, and supposed to have communication
with the invisible world.He affirmed that he had performed a magical
ceremony, termed tine egan, by which he evoked a fiend, from whom he
extorted a confession that Conachar, now called Eachin, or Hector,
MacIan, was the only man in the approaching combat between the two
hostile clans who should come off without blood or blemish.Hence
Torquil of the Oak argued that the presence of the fated person was
necessary to ensure the victory.'So much I am possessed of this,' said
the forester, 'that, unless Eachin fight in his place in the ranks of
the Clan Quhele, neither I, his foster father, nor any of my eight sons
will lift a weapon in the quarrel.'"This speech was received with much alarm; for the defection of
nine men, the stoutest of their tribe, would be a serious blow, more
especially if the combat, as begins to be rumoured, should be decided by
a small number from each side.The ancient superstition concerning
the foster son of the white doe was counterbalanced by a new and later
prejudice, and the father took the opportunity of presenting to the
clan his long hidden son, whose youthful, but handsome and animated,
countenance, haughty carriage, and active limbs excited the admiration
of the clansmen, who joyfully received him as the heir and descendant of
their chief, notwithstanding the ominous presage attending his birth and
nurture."From this tale, my lord," continued Simon Glover, "your lordship may
easily conceive why I myself should be secure of a good reception among
the Clan Quhele; and you may also have reason to judge that it would be
very rash in me to carry Catharine thither.And this, noble lord, is the
heaviest of my troubles.""We shall lighten the load, then," said Sir Patrick; "and, good glover,
I will take risk for thee and this damsel.My alliance with the Douglas
gives me some interest with Marjory, Duchess of Rothsay, his daughter,
the neglected wife of our wilful Prince.Rely on it, good glover, that
in her retinue thy daughter will be as secure as in a fenced castle.The
Duchess keeps house now at Falkland, a castle which the Duke of Albany,
to whom it belongs, has lent to her for her accommodation.I cannot
promise you pleasure, Fair Maiden; for the Duchess Marjory of Rothsay
is unfortunate, and therefore splenetic, haughty, and overbearing;
conscious of the want of attractive qualities, therefore jealous of
those women who possess them.But she is firm in faith and noble in
spirit, and would fling Pope or prelate into the ditch of her castle who
should come to arrest any one under her protection.You will therefore
have absolute safety, though you may lack comfort.""I have no title to more," said Catharine; "and deeply do I feel the
kindness that is willing to secure me such honourable protection.If she
be haughty, I will remember she is a Douglas, and hath right, as being
such, to entertain as much pride as may become a mortal; if she be
fretful, I will recollect that she is unfortunate, and if she be
unreasonably captious, I will not forget that she is my protectress.Heed no longer for me, my lord, when you have placed me under the noble
lady's charge.But my poor father, to be exposed amongst these wild and
dangerous people!""Think not of that, Catharine," said the glover: "I am as familiar with
brogues and bracken as if I had worn them myself.I have only to fear
that the decisive battle may be fought before I can leave this country;
and if the clan Quhele lose the combat, I may suffer by the ruin of my
protectors.""We must have that cared for," said Sir Patrick: "rely on my looking out
for your safety.But which party will carry the day, think you?""Frankly, my Lord Provost, I believe the Clan Chattan will have the
worse: these nine children of the forest form a third nearly of the band
surrounding the chief of Clan Quhele, and are redoubted champions.""And your apprentice, will he stand to it, thinkest thou?""He is hot as fire, Sir Patrick," answered the glover; "but he is also
unstable as water.Nevertheless, if he is spared, he seems likely to be
one day a brave man.""But, as now, he has some of the white doe's milk still lurking about
his liver, ha, Simon?""He has little experience, my lord," said the glover, "and I need not
tell an honoured warrior like yourself that danger must be familiar to
us ere we can dally with it like a mistress."This conversation brought them speedily to the Castle of Kinfauns,
where, after a short refreshment, it was necessary that the father and
the daughter should part, in order to seek their respective places of
refuge.It was then first, as she saw that her father's anxiety on her
account had drowned all recollections of his friend, that Catharine
dropped, as if in a dream, the name of "Henry Gow.""True--most true," continued her father; "we must possess him of our
purposes.""Leave that to me," said Sir Patrick."I will not trust to a messenger,
nor will I send a letter, because, if I could write one, I think he
could not read it.He will suffer anxiety in the mean while, but I will
ride to Perth tomorrow by times and acquaint him with your designs."It was a bitter moment, but
the manly character of the old burgher, and the devout resignation of
Catharine to the will of Providence made it lighter than might have been
expected.The good knight hurried the departure of the burgess, but
in the kindest manner; and even went so far as to offer him some gold
pieces in loan, which might, where specie was so scarce, be considered
as the ne plus ultra of regard.The glover, however, assured him he
was amply provided, and departed on his journey in a northwesterly
direction.The hospitable protection of Sir Patrick Charteris was no
less manifested towards his fair guest.She was placed under the charge
of a duenna who managed the good knight's household, and was compelled
to remain several days in Kinfauns, owing to the obstacles and delays
interposed by a Tay boatman, named Kitt Henshaw, to whose charge she was
to be committed, and whom the provost highly trusted.Thus were severed the child and parent in a moment of great danger and
difficulty, much augmented by circumstances of which they were then
ignorant, and which seemed greatly to diminish any chance of safety that
remained for them."Austin may do the same again for me."Pope's Prologue to Canterbury Tales from Chaucer.The course of our story will be best pursued by attending that of Simon
Glover.It is not our purpose to indicate the exact local boundaries of
the two contending clans, especially since they are not clearly pointed
out by the historians who have transmitted accounts of this memorable
feud.It is sufficient to say, that the territory of the Clan Chattan
extended far and wide, comprehending Caithness and Sutherland, and
having for their paramount chief the powerful earl of the latter shire,
thence called Mohr ar Chat.In this general sense, the Keiths, the
Sinclairs, the Guns, and other families and clans of great power, were
included in the confederacy.These, however, were not engaged in the
present quarrel, which was limited to that part of the Clan Chattan
occupying the extensive mountainous districts of Perthshire and
Inverness shire, which form a large portion of what is called the
northeastern Highlands.It is well known that two large septs,
unquestionably known to belong to the Clan Chattan, the MacPhersons and
the MacIntoshes, dispute to this day which of their chieftains was at
the head of this Badenoch branch of the great confederacy, and both have
of later times assumed the title of Captain of Clan Chattan.But, at all events, Badenoch must have been the centre of the
confederacy, so far as involved in the feud of which we treat.Of the rival league of Clan Quhele we have a still less distinct
account, for reasons which will appear in the sequel.Some authors have
identified them with the numerous and powerful sept of MacKay.If this
is done on good authority, which is to be doubted, the MacKays must have
shifted their settlements greatly since the reign of Robert III, since
they are now to be found (as a clan) in the extreme northern parts of
Scotland, in the counties of Ross and Sutherland.We cannot, therefore,
be so clear as we would wish in the geography of the story.Suffice
it that, directing his course in a northwesterly direction, the glover
travelled for a day's journey in the direction of the Breadalbane
country, from which he hoped to reach the castle where Gilchrist MacIan,
the captain of the Clan Quhele, and the father of his pupil Conachar,
usually held his residence, with a barbarous pomp of attendance and
ceremonial suited to his lofty pretensions.We need not stop to describe the toil and terrors of such a journey,
where the path was to be traced among wastes and mountains, now
ascending precipitous ravines, now plunging into inextricable bogs,
and often intersected with large brooks, and even rivers.But all these
perils Simon Glover had before encountered in quest of honest gain; and
it was not to be supposed that he shunned or feared them where liberty,
and life itself, were at stake.The danger from the warlike and uncivilised inhabitants of these wilds
would have appeared to another at least as formidable as the perils of
the journey.But Simon's knowledge of the manners and language of the
people assured him on this point also.An appeal to the hospitality of
the wildest Gael was never unsuccessful; and the kerne, that in other
circumstances would have taken a man's life for the silver button of
his cloak, would deprive himself of a meal to relieve the traveller who
implored hospitality at the door of his bothy.The art of travelling in
the Highlands was to appear as confident and defenceless as possible;
and accordingly the glover carried no arms whatever, journeyed without
the least appearance of precaution, and took good care to exhibit
nothing which might excite cupidity.Another rule which he deemed it
prudent to observe was to avoid communication with any of the passengers
whom he might chance to meet, except in the interchange of the common
civilities of salutation, which the Highlanders rarely omit.Few
opportunities occurred of exchanging even such passing greetings.The
country, always lonely, seemed now entirely forsaken; and, even in the
little straths or valleys which he had occasion to pass or traverse,
the hamlets were deserted, and the inhabitants had betaken themselves to
woods and caves.This was easily accounted for, considering the imminent
dangers of a feud which all expected would become one of the most
general signals for plunder and ravage that had ever distracted that
unhappy country.Simon began to be alarmed at this state of desolation.He had made a
halt since he left Kinfauns, to allow his nag some rest; and now he
began to be anxious how he was to pass the night.He had reckoned
upon spending it at the cottage of an old acquaintance, called Niel
Booshalloch (or the cow herd), because he had charge of numerous herds
of cattle belonging to the captain of Clan Quhele, for which purpose he
had a settlement on the banks of the Tay, not far from the spot where
it leaves the lake of the same name.From this his old host and friend,
with whom he had transacted many bargains for hides and furs, the old
glover hoped to learn the present state of the country, the prospect of
peace or war, and the best measures to be taken for his own safety.It
will be remembered that the news of the indentures of battle entered
into for diminishing the extent of the feud had only been communicated
to King Robert the day before the glover left Perth, and did not become
public till some time afterwards."If Niel Booshalloch hath left his dwelling like the rest of them, I
shall be finely holped up," thought Simon, "since I want not only the
advantage of his good advice, but also his interest with Gilchrist
MacIan; and, moreover, a night's quarters and a supper."Thus reflecting, he reached the top of a swelling green hill, and saw
the splendid vision of Loch Tay lying beneath him--an immense plate of
polished silver, its dark heathy mountains and leafless thickets of oak
serving as an arabesque frame to a magnificent mirror.Indifferent to natural beauty at any time, Simon Glover was now
particularly so; and the only part of the splendid landscape on which he
turned his eye was an angle or loop of meadow land where the river Tay,
rushing in full swoln dignity from its parent lake, and wheeling around
a beautiful valley of about a mile in breadth, begins his broad course
to the southeastward, like a conqueror and a legislator, to subdue
and to enrich remote districts.Upon the sequestered spot, which is so
beautifully situated between lake, mountain, and river, arose afterwards
the feudal castle of the Ballough [Balloch is Gaelic for the discharge
of a lake into a river], which in our time has been succeeded by the
splendid palace of the Earls of Breadalbane.But the Campbells, though they had already attained very great power
in Argyleshire, had not yet extended themselves so far eastward as Loch
Tay, the banks of which were, either by right or by mere occupancy,
possessed for, the present by the Clan Quhele, whose choicest herds were
fattened on the Balloch margin of the lake.In this valley, therefore,
between the river and the lake, amid extensive forests of oak wood,
hazel, rowan tree, and larches, arose the humble cottage of Niel
Booshalloch, a village Eumaeus, whose hospitable chimneys were seen to
smoke plentifully, to the great encouragement of Simon Glover, who might
otherwise have been obliged to spend the night in the open air, to his
no small discomfort.He reached the door of the cottage, whistled, shouted, and made his
approach known.There was a baying of hounds and collies, and presently
the master of the hut came forth.There was much care on his brow, and
he seemed surprised at the sight of Simon Glover, though the herdsman
covered both as well as he might; for nothing in that region could be
reckoned more uncivil than for the landlord to suffer anything to escape
him in look or gesture which might induce the visitor to think that
his arrival was an unpleasing, or even an unexpected, incident.The
traveller's horse was conducted to a stable, which was almost too low
to receive him, and the glover himself was led into the mansion of the
Booshalloch, where, according to the custom of the country, bread
and cheese was placed before the wayfarer, while more solid food was
preparing.Simon, who understood all their habits, took no notice of the
obvious marks of sadness on the brow of his entertainer and on those of
the family, until he had eaten somewhat for form's sake, after which he
asked the general question, "Was there any news in the country?""Bad news as ever were told," said the herdsman: "our father is no
more."said Simon, greatly alarmed, "is the captain of the Clan Quhele
dead?""The captain of the Clan Quhele never dies," answered the Booshalloch;
"but Gilchrist MacIan died twenty hours since, and his son, Eachin
MacIan, is now captain.""What, Eachin--that is Conachar--my apprentice?""As little of that subject as you list, brother Simon," said the
herdsman."It is to be remembered, friend, that your craft, which doth
very well for a living in the douce city of Perth, is something too
mechanical to be much esteemed at the foot of Ben Lawers and on the
banks of Loch Tay.We have not a Gaelic word by which we can even name a
maker of gloves.""It would be strange if you had, friend Niel," said Simon, drily,
"having so few gloves to wear.I think there be none in the whole Clan
Quhele, save those which I myself gave to Gilchrist MacIan, whom God
assoilzie, who esteemed them a choice propine.Most deeply do I regret
his death, for I was coming to him on express business.""You had better turn the nag's head southward with morning light," said
the herdsman."The funeral is instantly to take place, and it must be
with short ceremony; for there is a battle to be fought by the Clan
Quhele and the Clan Chattan, thirty champions on a side, as soon as Palm
Sunday next, and we have brief time either to lament the dead or honour
the living.""Yet are my affairs so pressing, that I must needs see the young chief,
were it but for a quarter of an hour," said the glover."Hark thee, friend," replied his host, "I think thy business must be
either to gather money or to make traffic.Now, if the chief owe thee
anything for upbringing or otherwise, ask him not to pay it when all the
treasures of the tribe are called in for making gallant preparation of
arms and equipment for their combatants, that we may meet these proud
hill cats in a fashion to show ourselves their superiors.But if thou
comest to practise commerce with us, thy time is still worse chosen.Thou knowest that thou art already envied of many of our tribe, for
having had the fosterage of the young chief, which is a thing usually
given to the best of the clan."'exclaimed the glover, "men should remember the
office was not conferred on me as a favour which I courted, but that
it was accepted by me on importunity and entreaty, to my no small
prejudice.This Conachar, or Hector, of yours, or whatever you call him,
has destroyed me doe skins to the amount of many pounds Scots.""There again, now," said the Booshalloch, "you have spoken word to cost
your life--any allusion to skins or hides, or especially to deer and
does--may incur no less a forfeit.The chief is young, and jealous of
his rank; none knows the reason better than thou, friend Glover.He
will naturally wish that everything concerning the opposition to
his succession, and having reference to his exile, should be totally
forgotten; and he will not hold him in affection who shall recall the
recollection of his people, or force back his own, upon what they must
both remember with pain.Think how, at such a moment, they will look
on the old glover of Perth, to whom the chief was so long apprentice!Come--come, old friend, you have erred in this.You are in over great
haste to worship the rising sun, while his beams are yet level with the
horizon.Come thou when he has climbed higher in the heavens, and thou
shalt have thy share of the warmth of his noonday height.""Niel Booshalloch," said the glover, "we have been old friends, as thou
say'st; and as I think thee a true one, I will speak to thee freely,
though what I say might be perilous if spoken to others of thy clan.Thou think'st I come hither to make my own profit of thy young chief,
and it is natural thou shouldst think so.But I would not, at my years,
quit my own chimney corner in Curfew Street to bask me in the beams of
the brightest sun that ever shone upon Highland heather.The very truth
is, I come hither in extremity: my foes have the advantage of me, and
have laid things to my charge whereof I am incapable, even in thought.Nevertheless, doom is like to go forth against me, and there is no
remedy but that I must up and fly, or remain and perish.I come to your
young chief, as one who had refuge with me in his distress--who ate of
my bread and drank of my cup.I ask of him refuge, which, as I trust, I
shall need but a short time.""That makes a different case," replied the herdsman."So different,
that, if you came at midnight to the gate of MacIan, having the King
of Scotland's head in your hand, and a thousand men in pursuit for the
avenging of his blood, I could not think it for his honour to refuse you
protection.And for your innocence or guilt, it concerns not the case;
or rather, he ought the more to shelter you if guilty, seeing your
necessity and his risk are both in that case the greater.I must
straightway to him, that no hasty tongue tell him of your arriving
hither without saying the cause.""A pity of your trouble," said the glover; "but where lies the chief?""He is quartered about ten miles hence, busied with the affairs of the
funeral, and with preparations for the combat--the dead to the grave and
the living to battle.""It is a long way, and will take you all night to go and come," said the
glover; "and I am very sure that Conachar when he knows it is I who--"

"Forget Conachar," said the herdsman, placing his finger on his lips."And as for the ten miles, they are but a Highland leap, when one bears
a message between his friend and his chief."So saying, and committing the traveller to the charge of his eldest son
and his daughter, the active herdsman left his house two hours before
midnight, to which he returned long before sunrise.He did not disturb
his wearied guest, but when the old man had arisen in the morning he
acquainted him that the funeral of the late chieftain was to take place
the same day, and that, although Eachin MacIan could not invite a Saxon
to the funeral, he would be glad to receive him at the entertainment
which was to follow."His will must be obeyed," said the glover, half smiling at the change
of relation between himself and his late apprentice."The man is
the master now, and I trust he will remember that, when matters were
otherwise between us, I did not use my authority ungraciously."exclaimed the Booshalloch, "the less of that you say
the better.You will find yourself a right welcome guest to Eachin, and
the deil a man dares stir you within his bounds.But fare you well, for
I must go, as beseems me, to the burial of the best chief the clan ever
had, and the wisest captain that ever cocked the sweet gale (bog myrtle)
in his bonnet.Farewell to you for a while, and if you will go to the
top of the Tom an Lonach behind the house, you will see a gallant sight,
and hear such a coronach as will reach the top of Ben Lawers.A boat
will wait for you, three hours hence, at a wee bit creek about half a
mile westward from the head of the Tay."With these words he took his departure, followed by his three sons, to
man the boat in which he was to join the rest of the mourners, and two
daughters, whose voices were wanted to join in the lament, which was
chanted, or rather screamed, on such occasions of general affliction.Simon Glover, finding himself alone, resorted to the stable to look
after his nag, which, he found, had been well served with graddan, or
bread made of scorched barley.Of this kindness he was fully sensible,
knowing that, probably, the family had little of this delicacy left to
themselves until the next harvest should bring them a scanty supply.In
animal food they were well provided, and the lake found them abundance
of fish for their lenten diet, which they did not observe very strictly;
but bread was a delicacy very scanty in the Highlands.The bogs afforded
a soft species of hay, none of the best to be sure; but Scottish horses,
like their riders, were then accustomed to hard fare.Gauntlet, for this was the name of the palfrey, had his stall crammed
full of dried fern for litter, and was otherwise as well provided for as
Highland hospitality could contrive.Simon Glover being thus left to his own painful reflections, nothing
better remained, after having seen after the comforts of the dumb
companion of his journey, than to follow the herdsman's advice; and
ascending towards the top of an eminence called Tom an Lonach, or the
Knoll of Yew Trees, after a walk of half an hour he reached the summit,
and could look down on the broad expanse of the lake, of which the
height commanded a noble view.A few aged and scattered yew trees
of great size still vindicated for the beautiful green hill the name
attached to it.But a far greater number had fallen a sacrifice to
the general demand for bow staves in that warlike age, the bow being a
weapon much used by the mountaineers, though those which they employed,
as well as their arrows, were, in shape and form, and especially in
efficacy, far inferior to the archery of merry England.The dark and
shattered individual yews which remained were like the veterans of a
broken host, occupying in disorder some post of advantage, with the
stern purpose of resisting to the last.Behind this eminence, but
detached from it, arose a higher hill, partly covered with copsewood,
partly opening into glades of pasture, where the cattle strayed,
finding, at this season of the year, a scanty sustenance among the
spring heads and marshy places, where the fresh grass began first to
arise.The opposite or northern shore of the lake presented a far more Alpine
prospect than that upon which the glover was stationed.Woods and
thickets ran up the sides of the mountains, and disappeared among the
sinuosities formed by the winding ravines which separated them from each
other; but far above these specimens of a tolerable natural soil arose
the swart and bare mountains themselves, in the dark grey desolation
proper to the season.Some were peaked, some broad crested, some rocky and precipitous, others
of a tamer outline; and the clan of Titans seemed to be commanded by
their appropriate chieftains--the frowning mountain of Ben Lawers, and
the still more lofty eminence of Ben Mohr, arising high above the rest,
whose peaks retain a dazzling helmet of snow far into the summer season,
and sometimes during the whole year.Yet the borders of this wild and
silvan region, where the mountains descended upon the lake, intimated,
even at that early period, many traces of human habitation.Hamlets were
seen, especially on the northern margin of the lake, half hid among the
little glens that poured their tributary streams into Loch Tay, which,
like many earthly things, made a fair show at a distance, but, when more
closely approached, were disgustful and repulsive, from their squalid
want of the conveniences which attend even Indian wigwams.They were
inhabited by a race who neither cultivated the earth nor cared for
the enjoyments which industry procures.The women, although otherwise
treated with affection, and even delicacy of respect, discharged all the
absolutely necessary domestic labour.The men, excepting some reluctant
use of an ill formed plough, or more frequently a spade, grudgingly gone
through, as a task infinitely beneath them, took no other employment
than the charge of the herds of black cattle, in which their wealth
consisted.At all other times they hunted, fished, or marauded, during
the brief intervals of peace, by way of pastime; plundering with bolder
license, and fighting with embittered animosity, in time of war, which,
public or private, upon a broader or more restricted scale, formed the
proper business of their lives, and the only one which they esteemed
worthy of them.The magnificent bosom of the lake itself was a scene to gaze on with
delight.Its noble breadth, with its termination in a full and beautiful
run, was rendered yet more picturesque by one of those islets which are
often happily situated in the Scottish lakes.The ruins upon that isle,
now almost shapeless, being overgrown with wood rose, at the time we
speak of, into the towers and pinnacles of a priory, where slumbered
the remains of Sibylla, daughter of Henry I of England, and consort
of Alexander the First of Scotland.This holy place had been deemed of
dignity sufficient to be the deposit of the remains of the captain of
the Clan Quhele, at least till times when the removal of the danger, now
so imminently pressing, should permit of his body being conveyed to a
distinguished convent in the north, where he was destined ultimately to
repose with all his ancestry.A number of boats pushed off from various points of the near and more
distant shore, many displaying sable banners, and others having their
several pipers in the bow, who from time to time poured forth a few
notes of a shrill, plaintive, and wailing character, and intimated to
the glover that the ceremony was about to take place.These sounds of
lamentation were but the tuning as it were of the instruments, compared
with the general wail which was speedily to be raised.A distant sound was heard from far up the lake, even as it seemed from
the remote and distant glens out of which the Dochart and the Lochy pour
their streams into Loch Tay.It was in a wild, inaccessible spot, where
the Campbells at a subsequent period founded their strong fortress of
Finlayrigg, that the redoubted commander of the Clan Quhele drew his
last breath; and, to give due pomp to his funeral, his corpse was now to
be brought down the loch to the island assigned for his temporary place
of rest.The funeral fleet, led by the chieftain's barge, from which a
huge black banner was displayed, had made more than two thirds of its
voyage ere it was visible from the eminence on which Simon Glover stood
to overlook the ceremony.The instant the distant wail of the coronach
was heard proceeding from the attendants on the funeral barge, all the
subordinate sounds of lamentation were hushed at once, as the raven
ceases to croak and the hawk to whistle whenever the scream of the eagle
is heard.The boats, which had floated hither and thither upon the lake,
like a flock of waterfowl dispersing themselves on its surface, now drew
together with an appearance of order, that the funeral flotilla might
pass onward, and that they themselves might fall into their proper
places.In the mean while the piercing din of the war pipes became
louder and louder, and the cry from the numberless boats which followed
that from which the black banner of the chief was displayed rose in
wild unison up to the Tom an Lonach, from which the glover viewed the
spectacle.The galley which headed the procession bore on its poop a
species of scaffold, upon which, arrayed in white linen, and with the
face bare, was displayed the corpse of the deceased chieftain.His son
and the nearest relatives filled the vessel, while a great number of
boats, of every description that could be assembled, either on Loch
Tay itself or brought by land carriage from Loch Earn and otherwise,
followed in the rear, some of them of very frail materials.There were
even curraghs, composed of ox hides stretched over hoops of willow,
in the manner of the ancient British, and some committed themselves
to rafts formed for the occasion, from the readiest materials that
occurred, and united in such a precarious manner as to render it
probable that, before the accomplishment of the voyage, some of the
clansmen of the deceased might be sent to attend their chieftain in the
world of spirits.When the principal flotilla came in sight of the smaller group of boats
collected towards the foot of the lake, and bearing off from the little
island, they hailed each other with a shout so loud and general, and
terminating in a cadence so wildly prolonged, that not only the deer
started from their glens for miles around, and sought the distant
recesses of the mountains, but even the domestic cattle, accustomed to
the voice of man, felt the full panic which the human shout strikes into
the wilder tribes, and like them fled from their pasture into morasses
and dingles.Summoned forth from their convent by those sounds, the monks who
inhabited the little islet began to issue from their lowly portal, with
cross and banner, and as much of ecclesiastical state as they had the
means of displaying; their bells at the same time, of which the edifice
possessed three, pealing the death toll over the long lake, which came
to the ears of the now silent multitude, mingled with the solemn chant
of the Catholic Church, raised by the monks in their procession.Various
ceremonies were gone through, while the kindred of the deceased carried
the body ashore, and, placing it on a bank long consecrated to the
purpose, made the deasil around the departed.When the corpse was
uplifted to be borne into the church, another united yell burst from the
assembled multitude, in which the deep shout of warriors and the shrill
wail of females joined their notes with the tremulous voice of age and
the babbling cry of childhood.The coronach was again, and for the last
time, shrieked as the body was carried into the interior of the
church, where only the nearest relatives of the deceased and the most
distinguished of the leaders of the clan were permitted to enter.The
last yell of woe was so terribly loud, and answered by so many hundred
echoes, that the glover instinctively raised his hands to his ears, to
shut out, or deaden at least, a sound so piercing.He kept this attitude
while the hawks, owls, and other birds, scared by the wild scream, had
begun to settle in their retreats, when, as he withdrew his hands, a
voice close by him said:

"Think you this, Simon Glover, the hymn of penitence and praise with
which it becomes poor forlorn man, cast out from his tenement of clay,
to be wafted into the presence of his maker?"The glover turned, and in the old man with a long white beard who stood
close beside him had no difficulty, from the clear mild eye and the
benevolent cast of features, to recognise the Carthusian monk Father
Clement, no longer wearing his monastic habiliments, but wrapped in a
frieze mantle and having a Highland cap on his head.It may be recollected that the glover regarded this man with a combined
feeling of respect and dislike--respect, which his judgment could not
deny to the monk's person and character, and dislike, which arose from
Father Clement's peculiar doctrines being the cause of his daughter's
exile and his own distress.It was not, therefore, with sentiments of
unmixed satisfaction that he returned the greetings of the father, and
replied to the reiterated question, what he thought of the funeral rites
which were discharged in so wild a manner: "I know not, my good father;
but these men do their duty to their deceased chief according to the
fashion of their ancestors: they mean to express their regret for their
friend's loss and their prayers to Heaven in his behalf; and that which
is done of goodwill must, to my thinking, be accepted favourably.Had
it been otherwise, methinks they had ere now been enlightened to do
better.""Thou art deceived," answered the monk."God has sent His light amongst
us all, though in various proportions; but man wilfully shuts his eyes
and prefers darkness.This benighted people mingle with the ritual of
the Roman Church the old heathen ceremonies of their own fathers, and
thus unite with the abominations of a church corrupted by wealth and
power the cruel and bloody ritual of savage paynims.""Father," said Simon, abruptly, "methinks your presence were more
useful in yonder chapel, aiding your brethren in the discharge of their
clerical duties, than in troubling and unsettling the belief of an
humble though ignorant Christian like myself.""And wherefore say, good brother, that I would unfix thy principles of
belief?""So Heaven deal with me, as, were my life
blood necessary to cement the mind of any man to the holy religion he
professeth, it should be freely poured out for the purpose.""Your speech is fair, father, I grant you," said the glover; "but if I
am to judge the doctrine by the fruits, Heaven has punished me by the
hand of the church for having hearkened thereto.Ere I heard you, my
confessor was little moved though I might have owned to have told
a merry tale upon the ale bench, even if a friar or a nun were the
subject.If at a time I had called Father Hubert a better hunter of
hares than of souls, I confessed me to the Vicar Vinesauf, who laughed
and made me pay a reckoning for penance; or if I had said that the Vicar
Vinesauf was more constant to his cup than to his breviary, I confessed
me to Father Hubert, and a new hawking glove made all well again; and
thus I, my conscience, and Mother Church lived together on terms of
peace, friendship, and mutual forbearance.But since I have listened to
you, Father Clement, this goodly union is broke to pieces, and nothing
is thundered in my ear but purgatory in the next world and fire and
fagot in this.Therefore, avoid you, Father Clement, or speak to those
who can understand your doctrine.I have no heart to be a martyr: I have
never in my whole life had courage enough so much as to snuff a candle
with my fingers; and, to speak the truth, I am minded to go back to
Perth, sue out my pardon in the spiritual court, carry my fagot to the
gallows foot in token of recantation, and purchase myself once more the
name of a good Catholic, were it at the price of all the worldly wealth
that remains to me.""You are angry, my dearest brother," said Clement, "and repent you on
the pinch of a little worldly danger and a little worldly loss for the
good thoughts which you once entertained.""You speak at ease, Father Clement, since I think you have long forsworn
the wealth and goods of the world, and are prepared to yield up your
life when it is demanded in exchange for the doctrine you preach and
believe.You are as ready to put on your pitched shirt and brimstone
head gear as a naked man is to go to his bed, and it would seem you have
not much more reluctance to the ceremony.But I still wear that which
clings to me.My wealth is still my own, and I thank Heaven it is a
decent pittance whereon to live; my life, too, is that of a hale old man
of sixty, who is in no haste to bring it to a close; and if I were
poor as Job and on the edge of the grave, must I not still cling to my
daughter, whom your doctrines have already cost so dear?""Thy daughter, friend Simon," said the Carmelite [Carthusian], "may be
truly called an angel upon earth.""Ay, and by listening to your doctrines, father, she is now like to be
called on to be an angel in heaven, and to be transported thither in a
chariot of fire.""Nay, my good brother," said Clement, "desist, I pray you, to speak of
what you little understand.Since it is wasting time to show thee the
light that thou chafest against, yet listen to that which I have to say
touching thy daughter, whose temporal felicity, though I weigh it not
even for an instant in the scale against that which is spiritual, is,
nevertheless, in its order, as dear to Clement Blair as to her own
father."The tears stood in the old man's eyes as he spoke, and Simon Glover was
in some degree mollified as he again addressed him."One would think thee, Father Clement, the kindest and most amiable of
men; how comes it, then, that thy steps are haunted by general ill
will wherever thou chancest to turn them?I could lay my life thou hast
contrived already to offend yonder half score of poor friars in their
water girdled cage, and that you have been prohibited from attendance on
the funeral?""Even so, my son," said the Carthusian, "and I doubt whether their
malice will suffer me to remain in this country.I did but speak a few
sentences about the superstition and folly of frequenting St.Fillan's
church, to detect theft by means of his bell, of bathing mad patients in
his pool, to cure their infirmity of mind; and lo!the persecutors have
cast me forth of their communion, as they will speedily cast me out of
this life.""Lo you there now," said the glover, "see what it is for a man that
cannot take a warning!Well, Father Clement, men will not cast me forth
unless it were as a companion of yours.I pray you, therefore, tell me
what you have to say of my daughter, and let us be less neighbours than
we have been.""This, then, brother Simon, I have to acquaint you with.This young
chief, who is swoln with contemplation of his own power and glory, loves
one thing better than it all, and that is thy daughter.""My runagate apprentice look up to my
daughter!"said Clement, "how close sits our worldly pride, even as ivy
clings to the wall, and cannot be separated!Look up to thy daughter,
good Simon?The captain of Clan Quhele, great as he is, and
greater as he soon expects to be, looks down to the daughter of the
Perth burgess, and considers himself demeaned in doing so.But, to use
his own profane expression, Catharine is dearer to him than life here
and Heaven hereafter: he cannot live without her.""Then he may die, if he lists," said Simon Glover, "for she is betrothed
to an honest burgess of Perth; and I would not break my word to make my
daughter bride to the Prince of Scotland.""I thought it would be your answer," replied the monk; "I would, worthy
friend, thou couldst carry into thy spiritual concerns some part of that
daring and resolved spirit with which thou canst direct thy temporal
affairs.""Hush thee--hush, Father Clement!"answered the glover; "when thou
fallest into that vein of argument, thy words savour of blazing tar, and
that is a scent I like not.As to Catharine, I must manage as I can, so
as not to displease the young dignitary; but well is it for me that she
is far beyond his reach.""She must then be distant indeed," said the Carmelite [Carthusian]."And now, brother Simon, since you think it perilous to own me and my
opinions, I must walk alone with my own doctrines and the dangers they
draw on me.But should your eye, less blinded than it now is by worldly
hopes and fears, ever turn a glance back on him who soon may be snatched
from you, remember, that by nought save a deep sense of the truth and
importance of the doctrine which he taught could Clement Blair have
learned to encounter, nay, to provoke, the animosity of the powerful and
inveterate, to alarm the fears of the jealous and timid, to walk in the
world as he belonged not to it, and to be accounted mad of men, that he
might, if possible, win souls to God.Heaven be my witness, that I would
comply in all lawful things to conciliate the love and sympathy of my
fellow creatures!It is no light thing to be shunned by the worthy as
an infected patient, to be persecuted by the Pharisees of the day as an
unbelieving heretic, to be regarded with horror at once and contempt by
the multitude, who consider me as a madman, who may be expected to turn
mischievous.But were all those evils multiplied an hundredfold, the
fire within must not be stifled, the voice which says within me 'Speak'
must receive obedience.Woe unto me if I preach not the Gospel, even
should I at length preach it from amidst the pile of flames!"So spoke this bold witness, one of those whom Heaven raised up from time
to time to preserve amidst the most ignorant ages, and to carry down to
those which succeed them, a manifestation of unadulterated Christianity,
from the time of the Apostles to the age when, favoured by the invention
of printing, the Reformation broke out in full splendour.The selfish
policy of the glover was exposed in his own eyes; and he felt himself
contemptible as he saw the Carthusian turn from him in all the
hallowedness of resignation.He was even conscious of a momentary
inclination to follow the example of the preacher's philanthropy and
disinterested zeal, but it glanced like a flash of lightning through a
dark vault, where there lies nothing to catch the blaze; and he slowly
descended the hill in a direction different from that of the Carthusian,
forgetting him and his doctrines, and buried in anxious thoughts about
his child's fate and his own.What want these outlaws conquerors should have
     But history's purchased page to call them great,
     A wider space, an ornamented grave?Their hopes were not less warm, their souls were full as brave.The funeral obsequies being over, the same flotilla which had proceeded
in solemn and sad array down the lake prepared to return with displayed
banners, and every demonstration of mirth and joy; for there was but
brief time to celebrate festivals when the awful conflict betwixt the
Clan Quhele and their most formidable rivals so nearly approached.It
had been agreed, therefore, that the funeral feast should be blended
with that usually given at the inauguration of the young chief.Some objections were made to this arrangement, as containing an evil
omen.But, on the other hand, it had a species of recommendation, from
the habits and feelings of the Highlanders, who, to this day, are wont
to mingle a degree of solemn mirth with their mourning, and something
resembling melancholy with their mirth.The usual aversion to speak
or think of those who have been beloved and lost is less known to this
grave and enthusiastic race than it is to others.You hear not only the
young mention (as is everywhere usual) the merits and the character of
parents, who have, in the course of nature, predeceased them; but the
widowed partner speaks, in ordinary conversation, of the lost spouse,
and, what is still stranger, the parents allude frequently to the beauty
or valour of the child whom they have interred.The Scottish Highlanders
appear to regard the separation of friends by death as something less
absolute and complete than it is generally esteemed in other countries,
and converse of the dear connexions who have sought the grave before
them as if they had gone upon a long journey in which they themselves
must soon follow.The funeral feast, therefore, being a general custom
throughout Scotland, was not, in the opinion of those who were to share
it, unseemingly mingled, on the present occasion, with the festivities
which hailed the succession to the chieftainship.The barge which had lately borne the dead to the grave now conveyed
the young MacIan to his new command and the minstrels sent forth their
gayest notes to gratulate Eachin's succession, as they had lately
sounded their most doleful dirges when carrying Gilchrist to his grave.From the attendant flotilla rang notes of triumph and jubilee, instead
of those yells of lamentation which had so lately disturbed the echoes
of Loch Tay; and a thousand voices hailed the youthful chieftain as he
stood on the poop, armed at all points, in the flower of early manhood,
beauty, and activity, on the very spot where his father's corpse had so
lately been extended, and surrounded by triumphant friends, as that had
been by desolate mourners.One boat kept closest of the flotilla to the honoured galley.Torquil
of the Oak, a grizzled giant, was steersman; and his eight sons, each
exceeding the ordinary stature of mankind, pulled the oars.Like some
powerful and favourite wolf hound, unloosed from his couples, and
frolicking around a liberal master, the boat of the foster brethren
passed the chieftain's barge, now on one side and now on another, and
even rowed around it, as if in extravagance of joy; while, at the same
time, with the jealous vigilance of the animal we have compared it to,
they made it dangerous for any other of the flotilla to approach so near
as themselves, from the risk of being run down by their impetuous
and reckless manoeuvres.Raised to an eminent rank in the clan by the
succession of their foster brother to the command of the Clan Quhele,
this was the tumultuous and almost terrible mode in which they testified
their peculiar share in their chief's triumph.Far behind, and with different feelings, on the part of one at least of
the company, came the small boat in which, manned by the Booshalloch and
one of his sons, Simon Glover was a passenger."If we are bound for the head of the lake," said Simon to his friend,
"we shall hardly be there for hours."But as he spoke the crew of the boat of the foster brethren, or
leichtach, on a signal from the chief's galley, lay on their oars until
the Booshalloch's boat came up, and throwing on board a rope of hides,
which Niel made fast to the head of his skiff, they stretched to their
oars once more, and, notwithstanding they had the small boat in tow,
swept through the lake with almost the same rapidity as before.The
skiff was tugged on with a velocity which seemed to hazard the pulling
her under water, or the separation of her head from her other timbers.Simon Glover saw with anxiety the reckless fury of their course, and the
bows of the boat occasionally brought within an inch or two of the level
of the water; and though his friend, Niel Booshalloch, assured him it
was all done in especial honour, he heartily wished his voyage might
have a safe termination.It had so, and much sooner than he apprehended;
for the place of festivity was not four miles distant from the
sepulchral island, being chosen to suit the chieftain's course, which
lay to the southeast, so soon as the banquet should be concluded.A
bay on the southern side of Loch Tay presented a beautiful beach of
sparkling sand, on which the boats might land with ease, and a dry
meadow, covered with turf, verdant considering the season, behind and
around which rose high banks, fringed with copsewood, and displaying the
lavish preparations which had been made for the entertainment.The Highlanders, well known for ready hatchet men, had constructed a
long arbour or silvan banqueting room, capable of receiving two hundred
men, while a number of smaller huts around seemed intended for sleeping
apartments.The uprights, the couples, and roof tree of the temporary
hall were composed of mountain pine, still covered with its bark.The
framework of the sides was of planks or spars of the same material,
closely interwoven with the leafy boughs of the fir and other
evergreens, which the neighbouring woods afforded, while the hills had
furnished plenty of heath to form the roof.Within this silvan palace
the most important personages present were invited to hold high
festival.Others of less note were to feast in various long sheds
constructed with less care; and tables of sod, or rough planks, placed
in the open air, were allotted to the numberless multitude.At a
distance were to be seen piles of glowing charcoal or blazing wood,
around which countless cooks toiled, bustled, and fretted, like so many
demons working in their native element.Pits, wrought in the hillside,
and lined with heated stones, served as ovens for stewing immense
quantities of beef, mutton, and venison; wooden spits supported sheep
and goats, which were roasted entire; others were cut into joints,
and seethed in caldrons made of the animal's own skins, sewed hastily
together and filled with water; while huge quantities of pike, trout,
salmon, and char were broiled with more ceremony on glowing embers.The
glover had seen many a Highland banquet, but never one the preparations
for which were on such a scale of barbarous profusion.He had little time, however, to admire the scene around him for, as
soon as they landed on the beach, the Booshalloch observed with some
embarrassment, that, as they had not been bidden to the table of the
dais, to which he seemed to have expected an invitation, they had best
secure a place in one of the inferior bothies or booths; and was leading
the way in that direction, when he was stopped by one of the bodyguards,
seeming to act as master of ceremonies, who whispered something in his
ear."I thought so," said the herdsman, much relieved--"I thought neither the
stranger nor the man that has my charge would be left out at the high
table."They were conducted accordingly into the ample lodge, within which were
long ranges of tables already mostly occupied by the guests, while those
who acted as domestics were placing upon them the abundant though rude
materials of the festival.The young chief, although he certainly saw
the glover and the herdsman enter, did not address any personal salute
to either, and their places were assigned them in a distant corner, far
beneath the salt, a huge piece of antique silver plate, the only article
of value that the table displayed, and which was regarded by the clan
as a species of palladium, only produced and used on the most solemn
occasions, such as the present.The Booshalloch, somewhat discontented, muttered to Simon as he took his
place: "These are changed days, friend.His father, rest his soul, would
have spoken to us both; but these are bad manners which he has learned
among you Sassenachs in the Low Country."To this remark the glover did not think it necessary to reply; instead
of which he adverted to the evergreens, and particularly to the skins
and other ornaments with which the interior of the bower was decorated.The most remarkable part of these ornaments was a number of Highland
shirts of mail, with steel bonnets, battle axes, and two handed swords
to match, which hung around the upper part of the room, together with
targets highly and richly embossed.Each mail shirt was hung over a well
dressed stag's hide, which at once displayed the armour to advantage and
saved it from suffering by damp."These," whispered the Booshalloch, "are the arms of the chosen
champions of the Clan Quhele.They are twenty-nine in number, as you
see, Eachin himself being the thirtieth, who wears his armour today,
else had there been thirty.And he has not got such a good hauberk after
all as he should wear on Palm Sunday.These nine suits of harness, of
such large size, are for the leichtach, from whom so much is expected.""And these goodly deer hides," said Simon, the spirit of his profession
awakening at the sight of the goods in which he traded--"think you the
chief will be disposed to chaffer for them?They are in demand for the
doublets which knights wear under their armour.""Did I not pray you," said Niel Booshalloch, "to say nothing on that
subject?""It is the mail shirts I speak of," said Simon--"may I ask if any of
them were made by our celebrated Perth armourer, called Henry of the
Wynd?""Thou art more unlucky than before," said Niel, "that man's name is to
Eachin's temper like a whirlwind upon the lake; yet no man knows for
what cause.""I can guess," thought our glover, but gave no utterance to the thought;
and, having twice lighted on unpleasant subjects of conversation, he
prepared to apply himself, like those around him, to his food, without
starting another topic.We have said as much of the preparations as may lead the reader to
conclude that the festival, in respect of the quality of the food, was
of the most rude description, consisting chiefly of huge joints of meat,
which were consumed with little respect to the fasting season, although
several of the friars of the island convent graced and hallowed the
board by their presence.The platters were of wood, and so were the
hooped cogues or cups out of which the guests quaffed their liquor, as
also the broth or juice of the meat, which was held a delicacy.There
were also various preparations of milk which were highly esteemed, and
were eaten out of similar vessels.Bread was the scarcest article at the
banquet, but the glover and his patron Niel were served with two small
loaves expressly for their own use.In eating, as, indeed, was then the
case all over Britain, the guests used their knives called skenes, or
the large poniards named dirks, without troubling themselves by the
reflection that they might occasionally have served different or more
fatal purposes.At the upper end of the table stood a vacant seat, elevated a step or
two above the floor.It was covered with a canopy of hollow boughs and
ivy, and there rested against it a sheathed sword and a folded banner.This had been the seat of the deceased chieftain, and was left vacant
in honour of him.Eachin occupied a lower chair on the right hand of the
place of honour.The reader would be greatly mistaken who should follow out this
description by supposing that the guests behaved like a herd of hungry
wolves, rushing upon a feast rarely offered to them.On the contrary,
the Clan Quhele conducted themselves with that species of courteous
reserve and attention to the wants of others which is often found in
primitive nations, especially such as are always in arms, because a
general observance of the rules of courtesy is necessary to prevent
quarrels, bloodshed, and death.The guests took the places assigned them
by Torquil of the Oak, who, acting as marischal taeh, i.e.sewer of
the mess, touched with a white wand, without speaking a word, the place
where each was to sit.Thus placed in order, the company patiently
waited for the portion assigned them, which was distributed among them
by the leichtach; the bravest men or more distinguished warriors of
the tribe being accommodated with a double mess, emphatically called
bieyfir, or the portion of a man.When the sewers themselves had seen
every one served, they resumed their places at the festival, and were
each served with one of these larger messes of food.Water was placed
within each man's reach, and a handful of soft moss served the purposes
of a table napkin, so that, as at an Eastern banquet, the hands were
washed as often as the mess was changed.For amusement, the bard recited
the praises of the deceased chief, and expressed the clan's confidence
in the blossoming virtues of his successor.The seannachie recited the
genealogy of the tribe, which they traced to the race of the Dalriads;
the harpers played within, while the war pipes cheered the multitude
without.The conversation among the guests was grave, subdued, and
civil; no jest was attempted beyond the bounds of a very gentle
pleasantry, calculated only to excite a passing smile.There were no
raised voices, no contentious arguments; and Simon Glover had heard a
hundred times more noise at a guild feast in Perth than was made on this
occasion by two hundred wild mountaineers.Even the liquor itself did not seem to raise the festive party above the
same tone of decorous gravity.Wine appeared in
very small quantities, and was served out only to the principal guests,
among which honoured number Simon Glover was again included.The wine
and the two wheaten loaves were indeed the only marks of notice which he
received during the feast; but Niel Booshalloch, jealous of his master's
reputation for hospitality, failed not to enlarge on them as proofs
of high distinction.Distilled liquors, since so generally used in
the Highlands, were then comparatively unknown.The usquebaugh was
circulated in small quantities, and was highly flavoured with a
decoction of saffron and other herbs, so as to resemble a medicinal
potion rather than a festive cordial.Cider and mead were seen at the
entertainment, but ale, brewed in great quantities for the purpose, and
flowing round without restriction, was the liquor generally used, and
that was drunk with a moderation much less known among the more modern
Highlanders.A cup to the memory of the deceased chieftain was the first
pledge solemnly proclaimed after the banquet was finished, and a low
murmur of benedictions was heard from the company, while the monks
alone, uplifting their united voices, sung Requiem eternam dona.An
unusual silence followed, as if something extraordinary was expected,
when Eachin arose with a bold and manly, yet modest, grace, and ascended
the vacant seat or throne, saying with dignity and firmness:

"This seat and my father's inheritance I claim as my right--so prosper
me God and St."How will you rule your father's children?"said an old man, the uncle
of the deceased."I will defend them with my father's sword, and distribute justice to
them under my father's banner."The old man, with a trembling hand, unsheathed the ponderous weapon,
and, holding it by the blade, offered the hilt to the young chieftain's
grasp; at the same time Torquil of the Oak unfurled the pennon of the
tribe, and swung it repeatedly over Eachin's head, who, with singular
grace and dexterity, brandished the huge claymore as in its defence.The guests raised a yelling shout to testify their acceptance of the
patriarchal chief who claimed their allegiance, nor was there any who,
in the graceful and agile youth before them, was disposed to recollect
the subject of sinister vaticinations.As he stood in glittering mail,
resting on the long sword, and acknowledging by gracious gestures the
acclamations which rent the air within, without, and around, Simon
Glover was tempted to doubt whether this majestic figure was that of the
same lad whom he had often treated with little ceremony, and began to
have some apprehension of the consequences of having done so.A
general burst of minstrelsy succeeded to the acclamations, and rock and
greenwood rang to harp and pipes, as lately to shout and yell of woe.It would be tedious to pursue the progress of the inaugural feast, or
detail the pledges that were quaffed to former heroes of the clan, and
above all to the twenty-nine brave galloglasses who were to fight in the
approaching conflict, under the eye and leading of their young chief.The bards, assuming in old times the prophetic character combined with
their own, ventured to assure them of the most distinguished victory,
and to predict the fury with which the blue falcon, the emblem of the
Clan Quhele, should rend to pieces the mountain cat, the well known
badge of the Clan Chattan.It was approaching sunset when a bowl, called the grace cup, made of
oak, hooped with silver, was handed round the table as the signal of
dispersion, although it was left free to any who chose a longer carouse
to retreat to any of the outer bothies.As for Simon Glover, the
Booshalloch conducted him to a small hut, contrived, it would seem,
for the use of a single individual, where a bed of heath and moss was
arranged as well as the season would permit, and an ample supply of
such delicacies as the late feast afforded showed that all care had been
taken for the inhabitant's accommodation."Do not leave this hut," said the Booshalloch, taking leave of his
friend and protege: "this is your place of rest.But apartments are lost
on such a night of confusion, and if the badger leaves his hole the toad
will creep into it."To Simon Glover this arrangement was by no means disagreeable.He had
been wearied by the noise of the day, and felt desirous of repose.After
eating, therefore, a morsel, which his appetite scarce required, and
drinking a cup of wine to expel the cold, he muttered his evening
prayer, wrapt himself in his cloak, and lay down on a couch which old
acquaintance had made familiar and easy to him.The hum and murmur,
and even the occasional shouts, of some of the festive multitude who
continued revelling without did not long interrupt his repose, and in
about ten minutes he was as fast asleep as if he had lain in his own bed
in Curfew Street.Two hours before the black cock crew, Simon Glover was wakened by a well
known voice, which called him by name.he replied, as he started from sleep, "is the morning
so far advanced?"and, raising his eyes, the person of whom he was
dreaming stood before him; and at the same moment, the events of
yesterday rushing on his recollection, he saw with surprise that the
vision retained the form which sleep had assigned it, and it was not the
mail clad Highland chief, with claymore in hand, as he had seen him
the preceding night, but Conachar of Curfew Street, in his humble
apprentice's garb, holding in his hand a switch of oak.An apparition
would not more have surprised our Perth burgher.As he gazed with
wonder, the youth turned upon him a piece of lighted bog wood which he
carried in a lantern, and to his waking exclamation replied:

"Even so, father Simon: it is Conachar, come to renew our old
acquaintance, when our intercourse will attract least notice."So saying, he sat down on a tressel which answered the purpose of
a chair, and placing the lantern beside him, proceeded in the most
friendly tone:

"I have tasted of thy good cheer many a day, father Simon; I trust thou
hast found no lack in my family?""None whatever, Eachin MacIan," answered the glover, for the simplicity
of the Celtic language and manners rejects all honorary titles; "it was
even too good for this fasting season, and much too good for me, since I
must be ashamed to think how hard you fared in Curfew Street.""Even too well, to use your own word," said Conachar, "for the deserts
of an idle apprentice and for the wants of a young Highlander.But
yesterday, if there was, as I trust, enough of food, found you not, good
glover, some lack of courteous welcome?Excuse it not--I know you did
so.But I am young in authority with my people, and I must not too early
draw their attention to the period of my residence in the Lowlands,
which, however, I can never forget.""I understand the cause entirely," said Simon; "and therefore it is
unwillingly, and as it were by force, that I have made so early a visit
hither."It is well you are come to see some of my Highland
splendour while it yet sparkles.Return after Palm Sunday, and who knows
whom or what you may find in the territories we now possess!The
wildcat may have made his lodge where the banqueting bower of MacIan now
stands."The young chief was silent, and pressed the top of the rod to his lips,
as if to guard against uttering more."There is no fear of that, Eachin," said Simon, in that vague way in
which lukewarm comforters endeavour to turn the reflections of their
friends from the consideration of inevitable danger."There is fear, and there is peril of utter ruin," answered Eachin, "and
there is positive certainty of great loss.I marvel my father consented
to this wily proposal of Albany.I would MacGillie Chattanach would
agree with me, and then, instead of wasting our best blood against
each other, we would go down together to Strathmore and kill and take
possession.I would rule at Perth and he at Dundee, and all the great
strath should be our own to the banks of the Firth of Tay.Such is the
policy I have caught from your old grey head, father Simon, when holding
a trencher at thy back, and listening to thy evening talk with Bailie
Craigdallie.""The tongue is well called an unruly member," thought the glover."Here have I been holding a candle to the devil, to show him the way to
mischief."But he only said aloud: "These plans come too late.""The indentures of battle are signed
by our marks and seals, the burning hate of the Clan Quhele and Clan
Chattan is blown up to an inextinguishable flame by mutual insults and
boasts.But to thine own affairs, father
Glover.It is religion that has brought thee hither, as I learn from
Niel Booshalloch.Surely, my experience of thy prudence did not lead
me to suspect thee of any quarrel with Mother Church.As for my old
acquaintance, Father Clement, he is one of those who hunt after the
crown of martyrdom, and think a stake, surrounded with blazing fagots,
better worth embracing than a willing bride.He is a very knight errant
in defence of his religious notions, and does battle wherever he comes.He hath already a quarrel with the monks of Sibyl's Isle yonder about
some point of doctrine."I have," answered Simon; "but we spoke little together, the time being
pressing.""He may have said that there is a third person--one more likely, I
think, to be a true fugitive for religion than either you, a shrewd
citizen, or he, a wrangling preacher--who would be right heartily
welcome to share our protection?Thou art dull, man, and wilt not guess
my meaning--thy daughter, Catharine."These last words the young chief spoke in English; and he continued the
conversation in that language, as if apprehensive of being overheard,
and, indeed, as if under the sense of some involuntary hesitation."My daughter Catharine," said the glover, remembering what the
Carthusian had told him, "is well and safe.""And wherefore came she
not with you?Think you the Clan Quhele have no cailliachs as active as
old Dorothy, whose hand has warmed my haffits before now, to wait upon
the daughter of their chieftain's master?""Again I thank you," said the glover, "and doubt neither your power nor
your will to protect my daughter, as well as myself.But an honourable
lady, the friend of Sir Patrick Charteris, hath offered her a safe place
of refuge without the risk of a toilsome journey through a desolate and
distracted country.""Oh, ay, Sir Patrick Charteris," said Eachin, in a more reserved and
distant tone; "he must be preferred to all men, without doubt.Simon Glover longed to punish this affectation of a boy who had been
scolded four times a day for running into the street to see Sir Patrick
Charteris ride past; but he checked his spirit of repartee, and simply
said:

"Sir Patrick Charteris has been provost of Perth for seven years, and it
is likely is so still, since the magistrates are elected, not in Lent,
but at St."Ah, father Glover," said the youth, in his kinder and more familiar
mode of address, "you are so used to see the sumptuous shows and
pageants of Perth, that you would but little relish our barbarous
festival in comparison.What didst thou think of our ceremonial of
yesterday?""It was noble and touching," said the glover; "and to me, who knew your
father, most especially so.When you rested on the sword and looked
around you, methought I saw mine old friend Gilchrist MacIan arisen from
the dead and renewed in years and in strength.""I played my part there boldly, I trust; and showed little of that
paltry apprentice boy whom you used to--use just as he deserved?""Eachin resembles Conachar," said the glover, "no more than a salmon
resembles a gar, though men say they are the same fish in a different
state, or than a butterfly resembles a grub.""Thinkest thou that, while I was taking upon me the power which all
women love, I would have been myself an object for a maiden's eye to
rest upon?To speak plain, what would Catharine have thought of me in
the ceremonial?""We approach the shallows now," thought Simon Glover, "and without nice
pilotage we drive right on shore.""Most women like show, Eachin; but I think my daughter Catharine be an
exception.She would rejoice in the good fortune of her household friend
and playmate; but she would not value the splendid MacIan, captain of
Clan Quhele, more than the orphan Conachar.""She is ever generous and disinterested," replied the young chief."But
yourself, father, have seen the world for many more years than she has
done, and can better form a judgment what power and wealth do for those
who enjoy them.Think, and speak sincerely, what would be your own
thoughts if you saw your Catharine standing under yonder canopy, with
the command over an hundred hills, and the devoted obedience of ten
thousand vassals; and as the price of these advantages, her hand in that
of the man who loves her the best in the world?""Meaning in your own, Conachar?""Ay, Conachar call me: I love the name, since it was by that I have been
known to Catharine.""Sincerely, then," said the glover, endeavouring to give the least
offensive turn to his reply, "my inmost thought would be the earnest
wish that Catharine and I were safe in our humble booth in Curfew
Street, with Dorothy for our only vassal.""And with poor Conachar also, I trust?You would not leave him to pine
away in solitary grandeur?""I would not," answered the glover, "wish so ill to the Clan Quhele,
mine ancient friends, as to deprive them, at the moment of emergency,
of a brave young chief, and that chief of the fame which he is about to
acquire at their head in the approaching conflict."Eachin bit his lip to suppress his irritated feelings as he replied:
"Words--words--empty words, father Simon.You fear the Clan Quhele
more than you love them, and you suppose their indignation would be
formidable should their chief marry the daughter of a burgess of Perth.""And if I do fear such an issue, Hector MacIan, have I not reason?How
have ill assorted marriages had issue in the house of MacCallanmore,
in that of the powerful MacLeans--nay, of the Lords of the Isles
themselves?What has ever come of them but divorce and exheredation,
sometimes worse fate, to the ambitious intruder?You could not marry my
child before a priest, and you could only wed her with your left
hand; and I--" he checked the strain of impetuosity which the subject
inspired, and concluded, "and I am an honest though humble burgher of
Perth, who would rather my child were the lawful and undoubted spouse of
a citizen in my own rank than the licensed concubine of a monarch.""I will wed Catharine before the priest and before the world, before
the altar and before the black stones of Iona," said the impetuous young
man."She is the love of my youth, and there is not a tie in religion or
honour but I will bind myself by them!If
we do but win this combat--and, with the hope of gaining Catharine, we
SHALL win it--my heart tells me so--I shall be so much lord over their
affections that, were I to take a bride from the almshouse, so it was
my pleasure, they would hail her as if she were a daughter of
MacCallanmore."You put words of offence in my mouth," said the old man, "and may next
punish me for them, since I am wholly in your power.But with my consent
my daughter shall never wed save in her own degree.Her heart would
break amid the constant wars and scenes of bloodshed which connect
themselves with your lot.If you really love her, and recollect her
dread of strife and combat, you would not wish her to be subjected to
the train of military horrors in which you, like your father, must
needs be inevitably and eternally engaged.Choose a bride amongst the
daughters of the mountain chiefs, my son, or fiery Lowland nobles.You
are fair, young, rich, high born, and powerful, and will not woo in
vain.You will readily find one who will rejoice in your conquests, and
cheer you under defeat.To Catharine, the one would be as frightful
as the other.A warrior must wear a steel gauntlet: a glove of kidskin
would be torn to pieces in an hour."A dark cloud passed over the face of the young chief, lately animated
with so much fire."Farewell," he said, "the only hope which could have lighted me to fame
or victory!"He remained for a space silent, and intensely thoughtful, with downcast
eyes, a lowering brow, and folded arms.At length he raised his hands,
and said: "Father,--for such you have been to me--I am about to tell you
a secret.Reason and pride both advise me to be silent, but fate urges
me, and must be obeyed.I am about to lodge in you the deepest and
dearest secret that man ever confided to man.But beware--end this
conference how it will--beware how you ever breathe a syllable of what
I am now to trust to you; for know that, were you to do so in the most
remote corner of Scotland, I have ears to hear it even there, and a
hand and poniard to reach a traitor's bosom.I am--but the word will not
out!""Do not speak it then," said the prudent glover: "a secret is no longer
safe when it crosses the lips of him who owns it, and I desire not a
confidence so dangerous as you menace me with.""Ay, but I must speak, and you must hear," said the youth."In this age
of battle, father, you have yourself been a combatant?""Once only," replied Simon, "when the Southron assaulted the Fair City.I was summoned to take my part in the defence, as my tenure required,
like that of other craftsmen, who are bound to keep watch and ward.""What can that import to the present business?""Much, else I had not asked the question," answered.Eachin, in the tone
of haughtiness which from time to time he assumed."An old man is easily brought to speak of olden times," said Simon, not
unwilling, on an instant's reflection, to lead the conversation away
from the subject of his daughter, "and I must needs confess my feelings
were much short of the high, cheerful confidence, nay, the pleasure,
with which I have seen other men go to battle.My life and profession
were peaceful, and though I have not wanted the spirit of a man, when
the time demanded it, yet I have seldom slept worse than the night
before that onslaught.My ideas were harrowed by the tales we were
told--nothing short of the truth--about the Saxon archers: how they drew
shafts of a cloth yard length, and used bows a third longer than ours.When I fell into a broken slumber, if but a straw in the mattress
pricked my side I started and waked, thinking an English arrow was
quivering in my body.In the morning, as I began for very weariness to
sink into some repose, I was waked by the tolling of the common bell,
which called us burghers to the walls; I never heard its sound peal so
like a passing knell before or since.""I did on my harness," said Simon, "such as it was; took my mother's
blessing, a high spirited woman, who spoke of my father's actions for
the honour of the Fair Town.This heartened me, and I felt still bolder
when I found myself ranked among the other crafts, all bowmen, for thou
knowest the Perth citizens have good skill in archery.We were dispersed
on the walls, several knights and squires in armour of proof being
mingled amongst us, who kept a bold countenance, confident perhaps in
their harness, and informed us, for our encouragement, that they would
cut down with their swords and axes any of those who should attempt to
quit their post.I was kindly assured of this myself by the old Kempe
of Kinfauns, as he was called, this good Sir Patrick's father, then our
provost.He was a grandson of the Red Rover, Tom of Longueville, and
a likely man to keep his word, which he addressed to me in especial,
because a night of much discomfort may have made me look paler than
usual; and, besides, I was but a lad.""And did his exhortation add to your fear or your resolution?"said
Eachin, who seemed very attentive."To my resolution," answered Simon; "for I think nothing can make a
man so bold to face one danger at some distance in his front as the
knowledge of another close behind him, to push him forward.Well, I
mounted the walls in tolerable heart, and was placed with others on the
Spey Tower, being accounted a good bowman.But a very cold fit seized me
as I saw the English, in great order, with their archers in front,
and their men at arms behind, marching forward to the attack in strong
columns, three in number.They came on steadily, and some of us would
fain have shot at them; but it was strictly forbidden, and we were
obliged to remain motionless, sheltering ourselves behind the battlement
as we best might.As the Southron formed their long ranks into lines,
each man occupying his place as by magic, and preparing to cover
themselves by large shields, called pavesses, which they planted before
them, I again felt a strange breathlessness, and some desire to go home
for a glass of distilled waters.But as I looked aside, I saw the worthy
Kempe of Kinfauns bending a large crossbow, and I thought it pity he
should waste the bolt on a true hearted Scotsman, when so many English
were in presence; so I e'en staid where I was, being in a comfortable
angle, formed by two battlements.The English then strode forward, and
drew their bowstrings--not to the breast, as your Highland kerne do, but
to the ear--and sent off their volleys of swallow tails before we could
call on St.I winked when I saw them haul up their tackle, and I
believe I started as the shafts began to rattle against the parapet.But looking round me, and seeing none hurt but John Squallit, the town
crier, whose jaws were pierced through with a cloth yard shaft, I took
heart of grace, and shot in my turn with good will and good aim.A
little man I shot at, who had just peeped out from behind his target,
dropt with a shaft through his shoulder.The provost cried, 'Well
stitched, Simon Glover!'John, for his own town, my fellow
craftsmen!'shouted I, though I was then but an apprentice.And if you
will believe me, in the rest of the skirmish, which was ended by the
foes drawing off, I drew bowstring and loosed shaft as calmly as if
I had been shooting at butts instead of men's breasts.I gained
some credit, and I have ever afterwards thought that, in case of
necessity--for with me it had never been matter of choice--I should not
have lost it again.And this is all I can tell of warlike experience in
battle.Other dangers I have had, which I have endeavoured to avoid like
a wise man, or, when they were inevitable, I have faced them like a
true one.Upon other terms a man cannot live or hold up his head in
Scotland.""I understand your tale," said Eachin; "but I shall find it difficult
to make you credit mine, knowing the race of which I am descended, and
especially that I am the son of him whom we have this day laid in the
tomb--well that he lies where he will never learn what you are now to
hear!Look, my father, the light which I bear grows short and pale, a
few minutes will extinguish it; but before it expires, the hideous tale
will be told.Father, I am--a COWARD!It is said at last, and the secret
of my disgrace is in keeping of another!"The young man sunk back in a species of syncope, produced by the agony
of his mind as he made the fatal communication.The glover, moved as
well by fear as by compassion, applied himself to recall him to life,
and succeeded in doing so, but not in restoring him to composure.He hid
his face with his hands, and his tears flowed plentifully and bitterly."For Our Lady's sake, be composed," said the old man, "and recall the
vile word!I know you better than yourself: you are no coward, but only
too young and inexperienced, ay, and somewhat too quick of fancy, to
have the steady valour of a bearded man.I would hear no other man say
that of you, Conachar, without giving him the lie.You are no coward:
I have seen high sparks of spirit fly from you even on slight enough
provocation."said the unfortunate youth; "but
when saw you them supported by the resolution that should have backed
them?The sparks you speak of fell on my dastardly heart as on a piece
of ice which could catch fire from nothing: if my offended pride urged
me to strike, my weakness of mind prompted me the next moment to fly.""Want of habit," said Simon; "it is by clambering over walls that youths
learn to scale precipices.Begin with slight feuds; exercise daily the
arms of your country in tourney with your followers."exclaimed the young chief,
starting as if something horrid had occurred to his imagination."How
many days are there betwixt this hour and Palm Sunday, and what is to
chance then?A list inclosed, from which no man can stir, more than the
poor bear who is chained to his stake.Sixty living men, the best
and fiercest--one alone excepted!--which Albyn can send down from her
mountains, all athirst for each other's blood, while a king and his
nobles, and shouting thousands besides, attend, as at a theatre, to
encourage their demoniac fury!Blows clang and blood flows, thicker,
faster, redder; they rush on each other like madmen, they tear each
other like wild beasts; the wounded are trodden to death amid the feet
of their companions!Blood ebbs, arms become weak; but there must be
no parley, no truce, no interruption, while any of the maimed wretches
remain alive!Here is no crouching behind battlements, no fighting with
missile weapons: all is hand to hand, till hands can no longer be raised
to maintain the ghastly conflict!If such a field is so horrible in
idea, what think you it will be in reality?""I can only pity you, Conachar," said Simon."It is hard to be the
descendant of a lofty line--the son of a noble father--the leader by
birth of a gallant array, and yet to want, or think you want, for
still I trust the fault lies much in a quick fancy, that over estimates
danger--to want that dogged quality which is possessed by every game
cock that is worth a handful of corn, every hound that is worth a
mess of offal.But how chanced it that, with such a consciousness of
inability to fight in this battle, you proffered even now to share your
chiefdom with my daughter?Your power must depend on your fighting this
combat, and in that Catharine cannot help you.""You mistake, old man," replied Eachin: "were Catharine to look kindly
on the earnest love I bear her, it would carry me against the front of
the enemies with the mettle of a war horse.Overwhelming as my sense
of weakness is, the feeling that Catharine looked on would give me
strength.Say yet--oh, say yet--she shall be mine if we gain the combat,
and not the Gow Chrom himself, whose heart is of a piece with his
anvil, ever went to battle so light as I shall do!One strong passion is
conquered by another."Cannot the recollection of your interest, your
honour, your kindred, do as much to stir your courage as the thoughts of
a brent browed lass?"You tell me but what I have told myself, but it is in vain," replied
Eachin, with a sigh."It is only whilst the timid stag is paired with
the doe that he is desperate and dangerous.Be it from constitution; be
it, as our Highland cailliachs will say, from the milk of the white
doe; be it from my peaceful education and the experience of your strict
restraint; be it, as you think, from an overheated fancy, which paints
danger yet more dangerous and ghastly than it is in reality, I cannot
tell.But I know my failing, and--yes, it must be said!--so sorely dread
that I cannot conquer it, that, could I have your consent to my wishes
on such terms, I would even here make a pause, renounce the rank I have
assumed, and retire into humble life.""What, turn glover at last, Conachar?""This beats the
legend of St.Nay--nay, your hand was not framed for that: you
shall spoil me no more doe skins.""Jest not," said Eachin, "I am serious.If I cannot labour, I will bring
wealth enough to live without it.They will proclaim me recreant with
horn and war pipe.Catharine will love me the better
that I have preferred the paths of peace to those of bloodshed, and
Father Clement shall teach us to pity and forgive the world, which will
load us with reproaches that wound not.I shall be the happiest of men;
Catharine will enjoy all that unbounded affection can confer upon her,
and will be freed from apprehension of the sights and sounds of horror
which your ill assorted match would have prepared for her; and you,
father Glover, shall occupy your chimney corner, the happiest and most
honoured man that ever--"

"Hold, Eachin--I prithee, hold," said the glover; "the fir light, with
which this discourse must terminate, burns very low, and I would speak
a word in my turn, and plain dealing is best.Though it may vex,
or perhaps enrage, you, let me end these visions by saying at once:
Catharine can never be yours.A glove is the emblem of faith, and a
man of my craft should therefore less than any other break his own.Catharine's hand is promised--promised to a man whom you may hate, but
whom you must honour--to Henry the armourer.The match is fitting by
degree, agreeable to their mutual wishes, and I have given my promise.It is best to be plain at once; resent my refusal as you will--I am
wholly in your power.The glover spoke thus decidedly, because he was aware from experience
that the very irritable disposition of his former apprentice yielded in
most cases to stern and decided resolution.Yet, recollecting where he
was, it was with some feelings of fear that he saw the dying flame leap
up and spread a flash of light on the visage of Eachin, which seemed
pale as the grave, while his eye rolled like that of a maniac in his
fever fit.The light instantly sunk down and died, and Simon felt a
momentary terror lest he should have to dispute for his life with
the youth, whom he knew to be capable of violent actions when highly
excited, however short a period his nature could support the measures
which his passion commenced.He was relieved by the voice of Eachin, who
muttered in a hoarse and altered tone:

"Let what we have spoken this night rest in silence for ever.If thou
bring'st it to light, thou wert better dig thine own grave."Thus speaking, the door of the hut opened, admitting a gleam of
moonshine.The form of the retiring chief crossed it for an instant, the
hurdle was then closed, and the shieling left in darkness.Simon Glover felt relieved when a conversation fraught with offence and
danger was thus peaceably terminated.But he remained deeply affected by
the condition of Hector MacIan, whom he had himself bred up."The poor child," said he, "to be called up to a place of eminence,
only to be hurled from it with contempt!What he told me I partly knew,
having often remarked that Conachar was more prone to quarrel than to
fight.But this overpowering faint heartedness, which neither shame
nor necessity can overcome, I, though no Sir William Wallace, cannot
conceive.And to propose himself for a husband to my daughter, as if
a bride were to find courage for herself and the bridegroom!No--no,
Catharine must wed a man to whom she may say, 'Husband, spare your
enemy'--not one in whose behalf she must cry, 'Generous enemy, spare my
husband!"Tired out with these reflections, the old man at length fell asleep.In the morning he was awakened by his friend the Booshalloch, who, with
something of a blank visage, proposed to him to return to his abode on
the meadow at the Ballough.He apologised that the chief could not see
Simon Glover that morning, being busied with things about the expected
combat; and that Eachin MacIan thought the residence at the Ballough
would be safest for Simon Glover's health, and had given charge that
every care should be taken for his protection and accommodation.Niel Booshalloch dilated on these circumstances, to gloss over the
neglect implied in the chief's dismissing his visitor without a
particular audience."His father knew better," said the herdsman."But where should he have
learned manners, poor thing, and bred up among your Perth burghers, who,
excepting yourself, neighbour Glover, who speak Gaelic as well as I do,
are a race incapable of civility?"Simon Glover, it may be well believed, felt none of the want of respect
which his friend resented on his account.On the contrary, he greatly
preferred the quiet residence of the good herdsman to the tumultuous
hospitality of the daily festival of the chief, even if there had not
just passed an interview with Eachin upon a subject which it would be
most painful to revive.To the Ballough, therefore, he quietly retreated, where, could he have
been secure of Catharine's safety, his leisure was spent pleasantly
enough.His amusement was sailing on the lake in a little skiff, which a
Highland boy managed, while the old man angled.He frequently landed
on the little island, where he mused over the tomb of his old friend
Gilchrist MacIan, and made friends with the monks, presenting the prior
with gloves of martens' fur, and the superior officers with each of them
a pair made from the skin of the wildcat.The cutting and stitching of
these little presents served to beguile the time after sunset, while
the family of the herdsman crowded around, admiring his address, and
listening to the tales and songs with which the old man had skill to
pass away a heavy evening.It must be confessed that the cautious glover avoided the conversation
of Father Clement, whom he erroneously considered as rather the author
of his misfortunes than the guiltless sharer of them."I will not," he
thought, "to please his fancies, lose the goodwill of these kind
monks, which may be one day useful to me.I have suffered enough by his
preachments already, I trow.Little the wiser and much the poorer they
have made me.No--no, Catharine and Clement may think as they will; but
I will take the first opportunity to sneak back like a rated hound at
the call of his master, submit to a plentiful course of haircloth and
whipcord, disburse a lusty mulct, and become whole with the church
again."More than a fortnight had passed since the glover had arrived at
Ballough, and he began to wonder that he had not heard news of Catharine
or of Henry Wynd, to whom he concluded the provost had communicated the
plan and place of his retreat.He knew the stout smith dared not come
up into the Clan Quhele country, on account of various feuds with
the inhabitants, and with Eachin himself, while bearing the name of
Conachar; but yet the glover thought Henry might have found means to
send him a message, or a token, by some one of the various couriers who
passed and repassed between the court and the headquarters of the Clan
Quhele, in order to concert the terms of the impending combat, the
march of the parties to Perth, and other particulars requiring previous
adjustment.It was now the middle of March, and the fatal Palm Sunday
was fast approaching.Whilst time was thus creeping on, the exiled glover had not even once
set eyes upon his former apprentice.The care that was taken to attend
to his wants and convenience in every respect showed that he was not
forgotten; but yet, when he heard the chieftain's horn ringing through
the woods, he usually made it a point to choose his walk in a different
direction.One morning, however, he found himself unexpectedly in
Eachin's close neighbourhood, with scarce leisure to avoid him, and thus
it happened.As Simon strolled pensively through a little silvan glade, surrounded
on either side with tall forest trees, mixed with underwood, a white doe
broke from the thicket, closely pursued by two deer greyhounds, one
of which griped her haunch, the other her throat, and pulled her down
within half a furlong of the glover, who was something startled at the
suddenness of the incident.The ear and piercing blast of a horn, and
the baying of a slow hound, made Simon aware that the hunters were close
behind, and on the trace of the deer.Hallooing and the sound of
men running through the copse were heard close at hand.A moment's
recollection would have satisfied Simon that his best way was to stand
fast, or retire slowly, and leave it to Eachin to acknowledge his
presence or not, as he should see cause.But his desire of shunning the
young man had grown into a kind of instinct, and in the alarm of finding
him so near, Simon hid himself in a bush of hazels mixed with holly,
which altogether concealed him.He had hardly done so ere Eachin, rosy
with exercise, dashed from the thicket into the open glade, accompanied
by his foster father, Torquil of the Oak.The latter, with equal
strength and address, turned the struggling hind on her back, and
holding her forefeet in his right hand, while he knelt on her body,
offered his skene with the left to the young chief, that he might cut
the animal's throat."It may not be, Torquil; do thine office, and take the assay thyself.I
must not kill the likeness of my foster--"

This was spoken with a melancholy smile, while a tear at the same time
stood in the speaker's eye.Torquil stared at his young chief for an
instant, then drew his sharp wood knife across the creature's throat
with a cut so swift and steady that the weapon reached the backbone.Then rising on his feet, and again fixing a long piercing look on his
chief, he said: "As much as I have done to that hind would I do to any
living man whose ears could have heard my dault (foster son) so much as
name a white doe, and couple the word with Hector's name!"If Simon had no reason before to keep himself concealed, this speech of
Torquil furnished him with a pressing one."It cannot be concealed, father Torquil," said Eachin: "it will all out
to the broad day.""It is the fatal secret," thought Simon; "and now, if this huge privy
councillor cannot keep silence, I shall be made answerable, I suppose,
for Eachin's disgrace having been blown abroad."Thinking thus anxiously, he availed himself at the same time of his
position to see as much as he could of what passed between the afflicted
chieftain and his confidant, impelled by that spirit of curiosity which
prompts us in the most momentous, as well as the most trivial, occasions
of life, and which is sometimes found to exist in company with great
personal fear.As Torquil listened to what Eachin communicated, the young man sank
into his arms, and, supporting himself on his shoulder, concluded his
confession by a whisper into his ear.Torquil seemed to listen with such
amazement as to make him incapable of crediting his ears.As if to be
certain that it was Eachin who spoke, he gradually roused the youth from
his reclining posture, and, holding him up in some measure by a grasp on
his shoulder, fixed on him an eye that seemed enlarged, and at the same
time turned to stone, by the marvels he listened to.And so wild waxed
the old man's visage after he had heard the murmured communication,
that Simon Glover apprehended he would cast the youth from him as a
dishonoured thing, in which case he might have lighted among the very
copse in which he lay concealed, and occasioned his discovery in a
manner equally painful and dangerous.But the passions of Torquil,
who entertained for his foster child even a double portion of that
passionate fondness which always attends that connexion in the Highlands
took a different turn."I believe it not," he exclaimed; "it is false of thy father's child,
false of thy mother's son, falsest of my dault!I offer my gage to
heaven and hell, and will maintain the combat with him that shall call
it true.Thou hast been spellbound by an evil eye, my darling, and the
fainting which you call cowardice is the work of magic.I remember the
bat that struck the torch out on the hour that thou wert born--that hour
of grief and of joy.Thou shalt with me to Iona,
and the good St.Columbus, with the whole choir of blessed saints and
angels, who ever favoured thy race, shall take from thee the heart of
the white doe and return that which they have stolen from thee."Eachin listened, with a look as if he would fain have believed the words
of the comforter."But, Torquil," he said, "supposing this might avail us, the fatal day
approaches, and if I go to the lists, I dread me we shall be shamed.""Hell shall not prevail so
far: we will steep thy sword in holy water, place vervain, St.John's
Wort, and rowan tree in thy crest.We will surround thee, I and thy
eight brethren: thou shalt be safe as in a castle."Again the youth helplessly uttered something, which, from the dejected
tone in which it was spoken, Simon could not understand, while Torquil's
deep tones in reply fell full and distinct upon his ear."Yes, there may be a chance of withdrawing thee from the conflict.Thou
art the youngest who is to draw blade.Now, hear me, and thou shalt know
what it is to have a foster father's love, and how far it exceeds the
love even of kinsmen.The youngest on the indenture of the Clan Chattan
is Ferquhard Day.His father slew mine, and the red blood is seething
hot between us; I looked to Palm Sunday as the term that should cool it.Thou wouldst have thought that the blood in the veins of this
Ferquhard Day and in mine would not have mingled had they been put into
the same vessel, yet hath he cast the eyes of his love upon my only
daughter Eva, the fairest of our maidens.Think with what feelings I
heard the news.It was as if a wolf from the skirts of Farragon had
said, 'Give me thy child in wedlock, Torquil.'My child thought not
thus: she loves Ferquhard, and weeps away her colour and strength in
dread of the approaching battle.Let her give him but a sign of favour,
and well I know he will forget kith and kin, forsake the field, and fly
with her to the desert.""He, the youngest of the champions of Clan Chattan, being absent, I, the
youngest of the Clan Quhele, may be excused from combat" said Eachin,
blushing at the mean chance of safety thus opened to him."See now, my chief;" said Torquil, "and judge my thoughts towards
thee: others might give thee their own lives and that of their sons--I
sacrifice to thee the honour of my house.""My friend--my father," repeated the chief, folding Torquil to his
bosom, "what a base wretch am I that have a spirit dastardly enough to
avail myself of your sacrifice!"Let us back to the camp, and
send our gillies for the venison.The slowhound, or lyme dog, luckily for Simon, had drenched his nose in
the blood of the deer, else he might have found the glover's lair in the
thicket; but its more acute properties of scent being lost, it followed
tranquilly with the gazehounds.When the hunters were out of sight and hearing, the glover arose,
greatly relieved by their departure, and began to move off in the
opposite direction as fast as his age permitted.His first reflection
was on the fidelity of the foster father."The wild mountain heart is faithful and true.Yonder man is more like
the giants in romaunts than a man of mould like ourselves; and yet
Christians might take an example from him for his lealty.A simple
contrivance this, though, to finger a man from off their enemies'
chequer, as if there would not be twenty of the wildcats ready to supply
his place."Thus thought the glover, not aware that the strictest proclamations
were issued, prohibiting any of the two contending clans, their friends,
allies, and dependants, from coming within fifty miles of Perth, during
a week before and a week after the combat, which regulation was to be
enforced by armed men.So soon as our friend Simon arrived at the habitation of the herdsman,
he found other news awaiting him.They were brought by Father Clement,
who came in a pilgrim's cloak, or dalmatic, ready to commence his return
to the southward, and desirous to take leave of his companion in exile,
or to accept him as a travelling companion."But what," said the citizen, "has so suddenly induced you to return
within the reach of danger?""Have you not heard," said Father Clement, "that, March and his English
allies having retired into England before the Earl of Douglas, the good
earl has applied himself to redress the evils of the commonwealth, and
hath written to the court letters desiring that the warrant for the High
Court of Commission against heresy be withdrawn, as a trouble to men's
consciences, that the nomination of Henry of Wardlaw to be prelate of
St.Andrews be referred to the Parliament, with sundry other things
pleasing to the Commons?Now, most of the nobles that are with the King
at Perth, and with them Sir Patrick Charteris, your worthy provost, have
declared for the proposals of the Douglas.The Duke of Albany had agreed
to them--whether from goodwill or policy I know not.The good King is
easily persuaded to mild and gentle courses.And thus are the jaw
teeth of the oppressors dashed to pieces in their sockets, and the prey
snatched from their ravening talons.Will you with me to the Lowlands,
or do you abide here a little space?"Neil Booshalloch saved his friend the trouble of reply."He had the chief's authority," he said, "for saying that Simon Glover
should abide until the champions went down to the battle."In this answer the citizen saw something not quite consistent with his
own perfect freedom of volition; but he cared little for it at the
time, as it furnished a good apology for not travelling along with the
clergyman."An exemplary man," he said to his friend Niel Booshalloch, as soon as
Father Clement had taken leave--"a great scholar and a great saint.It
is a pity almost he is no longer in danger to be burned, as his sermon
at the stake would convert thousands.O Niel Booshalloch, Father
Clement's pile would be a sweet savouring sacrifice and a beacon to
all decent Christians!But what would the burning of a borrel ignorant
burgess like me serve?Men offer not up old glove leather for incense,
nor are beacons fed with undressed hides, I trow.Sooth to speak, I have
too little learning and too much fear to get credit by the affair, and,
therefore, I should, in our homely phrase, have both the scathe and the
scorn.""True for you," answered the herdsman.We must return to the characters of our dramatic narrative whom we
     left at Perth, when we accompanied the glover and his fair daughter
     to Kinfauns, and from that hospitable mansion traced the course of
     Simon to Loch Tay; and the Prince, as the highest personage, claims
     our immediate attention.This rash and inconsiderate young man endured with some impatience his
sequestered residence with the Lord High Constable, with whose company,
otherwise in every respect satisfactory, he became dissatisfied, from
no other reason than that he held in some degree the character of his
warder.Incensed against his uncle and displeased with his father, he
longed, not unnaturally, for the society of Sir John Ramorny, on whom he
had been so long accustomed to throw himself for amusement, and, though
he would have resented the imputation as an insult, for guidance and
direction.He therefore sent him a summons to attend him, providing his
health permitted; and directed him to come by water to a little pavilion
in the High Constable's garden, which, like that of Sir John's own
lodgings, ran down to the Tay.In renewing an intimacy so dangerous,
Rothsay only remembered that he had been Sir Join Ramorny's munificent
friend; while Sir John, on receiving the invitation, only recollected,
on his part, the capricious insults he had sustained from his patron,
the loss of his hand, and the lightness with which he had treated the
subject, and the readiness with which Rothsay had abandoned his cause in
the matter of the bonnet maker's slaughter.He laughed bitterly when he
read the Prince's billet."Eviot," he said, "man a stout boat with six trusty men--trusty men,
mark me--lose not a moment, and bid Dwining instantly come hither."Heaven smiles on us, my trusty friend," he said to the mediciner."I
was but beating my brains how to get access to this fickle boy, and here
he sends to invite me."I see the matter very clearly," said Dwining."Heaven smiles on
some untoward consequences--he!"No matter, the trap is ready; and it is baited, too, my friend, with
what would lure the boy from a sanctuary, though a troop with drawn
weapons waited him in the churchyard.His own weariness of himself would have done the job.Get thy matters
ready--thou goest with us.Write to him, as I cannot, that we come
instantly to attend his commands, and do it clerkly.He reads well, and
that he owes to me.""He will be your valiancie's debtor for more knowledge before he
dies--he!But is your bargain sure with the Duke of Albany?""Enough to gratify my ambition, thy avarice, and the revenge of both.Aboard--aboard, and speedily; let Eviot throw in a few flasks of the
choicest wine, and some cold baked meats.""But your arm, my lord, Sir John?"The throbbing of my heart silences the pain of my wound.It beats as it
would burst my bosom."said Dwining; adding, in a low voice--"It would be a
strange sight if it should.I should like to dissect it, save that its
stony case would spoil my best instruments."In a few minutes they were in the boat, while a speedy messenger carried
the note to the Prince.Rothsay was seated with the Constable, after their noontide repast.He
was sullen and silent; and the earl had just asked whether it was his
pleasure that the table should be cleared, when a note, delivered to the
Prince, changed at once his aspect."I go to the pavilion in the garden--always
with permission of my Lord Constable--to receive my late master of the
horse.""Ay, my lord; must I ask permission twice?""No, surely, my lord," answered the Constable; "but has your Royal
Highness recollected that Sir John Ramorny--"

"Has not the plague, I hope?""Come, Errol,
you would play the surly turnkey, but it is not in your nature; farewell
for half an hour."said Errol, as the Prince, flinging open a lattice of
the ground parlour in which they sat, stept out into the garden--"a new
folly, to call back that villain to his counsels.The Prince, in the mean time, looked back, and said hastily:

"Your lordship's good housekeeping will afford us a flask or two of
wine and a slight collation in the pavilion?I love the al fresco of the
river."The Constable bowed, and gave the necessary orders; so that Sir John
found the materials of good cheer ready displayed, when, landing from
his barge, he entered the pavilion."It grieves my heart to see your Highness under restraint," said
Ramorny, with a well executed appearance of sympathy."That grief of thine will grieve mine," said the Prince."I am sure here
has Errol, and a right true hearted lord he is, so tired me with grave
looks, and something like grave lessons, that he has driven me back to
thee, thou reprobate, from whom, as I expect nothing good, I may perhaps
obtain something entertaining.Yet, ere we say more, it was foul work,
that upon the Fastern's Even, Ramorny.I well hope thou gavest not aim
to it.""On my honour, my lord, a simple mistake of the brute Bonthron.I did
hint to him that a dry beating would be due to the fellow by whom I had
lost a hand; and lo you, my knave makes a double mistake.He takes one
man for another, and instead of the baton he uses the axe.""It is well that it went no farther.Small matter for the bonnet maker;
but I had never forgiven you had the armourer fallen--there is not his
match in Britain.But I hope they hanged the villain high enough?""If thirty feet might serve," replied Ramorny.no more of him," said Rothsay; "his wretched name makes the good
wine taste of blood.And what are the news in Perth, Ramorny?How stands
it with the bona robas and the galliards?""Little galliardise stirring, my lord," answered the knight."All eyes
are turned to the motions of the Black Douglas, who comes with five
thousand chosen men to put us all to rights, as if he were bound for
another Otterburn.It is said he is to be lieutenant again.It is
certain many have declared for his faction.""It is time, then, my feet were free," said Rothsay, "otherwise I may
find a worse warder than Errol."were you once away from this place, you might make as bold
a head as Douglas.""Ramorny," said the Prince, gravely, "I have but a confused remembrance
of your once having proposed something horrible to me.I would be free--I would have my person at my own disposal; but
I will never levy arms against my father, nor those it pleases him to
trust.""It was only for your Royal Highness's personal freedom that I was
presuming to speak," answered Ramorny."Were I in your Grace's place,
I would get me into that good boat which hovers on the Tay, and drop
quietly down to Fife, where you have many friends, and make free to take
possession of Falkland.It is a royal castle; and though the King has
bestowed it in gift on your uncle, yet surely, even if the grant were
not subject to challenge, your Grace might make free with the residence
of so near a relative.""He hath made free with mine," said the Duke, "as the stewartry of
Renfrew can tell.But stay, Ramorny--hold; did I not hear Errol say
that the Lady Marjory Douglas, whom they call Duchess of Rothsay, is
at Falkland?I would neither dwell with that lady nor insult her by
dislodging her.""The lady was there, my lord," replied Ramorny; "I have sure advice that
she is gone to meet her father."or perhaps to beg him to spare
me, providing I come on my knees to her bed, as pilgrims say the emirs
and amirals upon whom a Saracen soldan bestows a daughter in marriage
are bound to do?Ramorny, I will act by the Douglas's own saying, 'It
is better to hear the lark sing than the mouse squeak.'I will keep both
foot and hand from fetters.""No place fitter than Falkland," replied Ramorny."I have enough of good
yeomen to keep the place; and should your Highness wish to leave it, a
brief ride reaches the sea in three directions."Neither mirth, music,
nor maidens--ha!""Pardon me, noble Duke; but, though the Lady Marjory Douglas be
departed, like an errant dame in romance, to implore succour of her
doughty sire, there is, I may say, a lovelier, I am sure a younger,
maiden, either presently at Falkland or who will soon be on the road
thither.Your Highness has not forgotten the Fair Maid of Perth?""Forget the prettiest wench in Scotland!No--any more than thou hast
forgotten the hand that thou hadst in the Curfew Street onslaught on St.Your Highness would say, the hand that I lost.As
certain as I shall never regain it, Catharine Glover is, or will soon
be, at Falkland.I will not flatter your Highness by saying she
expects to meet you; in truth, she proposes to place herself under the
protection of the Lady Marjory.""The little traitress," said the Prince--"she too to turn against me?"I trust your Grace will make her penance a gentle one," replied the
knight."Faith, I would have been her father confessor long ago, but I have ever
found her coy.""Opportunity was lacking, my lord," replied Ramorny; "and time presses
even now.""Nay, I am but too apt for a frolic; but my father--"

"He is personally safe," said Ramorny, "and as much at freedom as ever
he can be; while your Highness--"

"Must brook fetters, conjugal or literal--I know it.Yonder comes
Douglas, with his daughter in his hand, as haughty and as harsh featured
as himself, bating touches of age.""And at Falkland sits in solitude the fairest wench in Scotland," said
Ramorny."Here is penance and restraint, yonder is joy and freedom.""Thou hast prevailed, most sage counsellor," replied Rothsay; "but mark
you, it shall be the last of my frolics.""I trust so," replied Ramorny; "for, when at liberty, you may make a
good accommodation with your royal father.""I will write to him, Ramorny.No, I cannot
put my thoughts in words--do thou write.""Your Royal Highness forgets," said Ramorny, pointing to his mutilated
arm."So please your Highness," answered his counsellor, "if you would use
the hand of the mediciner, Dwining--he writes like a clerk.""Hath he a hint of the circumstances?"Fully," said Ramorny; and, stepping to the window, he called Dwining
from the boat.He entered the presence of the Prince of Scotland, creeping as if he
trode upon eggs, with downcast eyes, and a frame that seemed shrunk up
by a sense of awe produced by the occasion.I will make trial of you; thou
know'st the case--place my conduct to my father in a fair light."Dwining sat down, and in a few minutes wrote a letter, which he handed
to Sir John Ramorny."Why, the devil has aided thee, Dwining," said the knight.'Respected father and liege sovereign--Know that important
considerations induce me to take my departure from this your court,
purposing to make my abode at Falkland, both as the seat of my dearest
uncle Albany, with whom I know your Majesty would desire me to use all
familiarity, and as the residence of one from whom I have been too
long estranged, and with whom I haste to exchange vows of the closest
affection from henceforward.'"The Duke of Rothsay and Ramorny laughed aloud; and the physician,
who had listened to his own scroll as if it were a sentence of death,
encouraged by their applause, raised his eyes, uttered faintly his
chuckling note of "He!and was again grave and silent, as if afraid
he had transgressed the bounds of reverent respect.The old man will apply
all this to the Duchess, as they call her, of Rothsay.Dwining, thou
shouldst be a secretis to his Holiness the Pope, who sometimes, it is
said, wants a scribe that can make one word record two meanings.I will
subscribe it, and have the praise of the device.""And now, my lord," said Ramorny, sealing the letter and leaving it
behind, "will you not to boat?""Not till my chamberlain attends with some clothes and necessaries, and
you may call my sewer also.""My lord," said Ramorny, "time presses, and preparation will but excite
suspicion.Your officers will follow with the mails tomorrow.For
tonight, I trust my poor service may suffice to wait on you at table and
chamber.""Nay, this time it is thou who forgets," said the Prince, touching the
wounded arm with his walking rod."Recollect, man, thou canst neither
carve a capon nor tie a point--a goodly sewer or valet of the mouth!"Ramorny grinned with rage and pain; for his wound, though in a way of
healing, was still highly sensitive, and even the pointing a finger
towards it made him tremble."Will your Highness now be pleased to take boat?""Not till I take leave of the Lord Constable.Rothsay must not slip
away, like a thief from a prison, from the house of Errol."My Lord Duke," said Ramorny, "it may be dangerous to our plan.""To the devil with danger, thy plan, and thyself!I must and will act to
Errol as becomes us both."The earl entered, agreeable to the Prince's summons."I gave you this trouble, my lord," said Rothsay, with the dignified
courtesy which he knew so well how to assume, "to thank you for your
hospitality and your good company.I can enjoy them no longer, as
pressing affairs call me to Falkland.""My lord," said the Lord High Constable, "I trust your Grace remembers
that you are--under ward."If I am a prisoner, speak plainly; if not, I will
take my freedom to depart.""I would, my lord, your Highness would request his Majesty's permission
for this journey."Mean you displeasure against yourself, my lord, or against me?""I have already said your Highness lies in ward here; but if you
determine to break it, I have no warrant--God forbid--to put force on
your inclinations.I can but entreat your Highness, for your own sake--"

"Of my own interest I am the best judge.The wilful Prince stepped into the boat with Dwining and Ramorny, and,
waiting for no other attendance, Eviot pushed off the vessel, which
descended the Tay rapidly by the assistance of sail and oar and of the
ebb tide.For some space the Duke of Rothsay appeared silent and moody, nor did
his companions interrupt his reflections.He raised his head at length
and said: "My father loves a jest, and when all is over he will take
this frolic at no more serious rate than it deserves--a fit of youth,
with which he will deal as he has with others.Yonder, my masters, shows
the old hold of Kinfauns, frowning above the Tay.Now, tell me, John
Ramorny, how thou hast dealt to get the Fair Maid of Perth out of the
hands of yonder bull headed provost; for Errol told me it was rumoured
that she was under his protection.""Truly she was, my lord, with the purpose of being transferred to the
patronage of the Duchess--I mean of the Lady Marjory of Douglas.Now,
this beetle headed provost, who is after all but a piece of blundering
valiancy, has, like most such, a retainer of some slyness and cunning,
whom he uses in all his dealings, and whose suggestions he generally
considers as his own ideas.Whenever I would possess myself of a
landward baron, I address myself to such a confidant, who, in the
present case, is called Kitt Henshaw, an old skipper upon the Tay,
and who, having in his time sailed as far as Campvere, holds with Sir
Patrick Charteris the respect due to one who has seen foreign countries.This his agent I have made my own, and by his means have insinuated
various apologies in order to postpone the departure of Catharine for
Falkland.""I know not if it is wise to tell your Highness, lest you should
disapprove of my views.I meant the officers of the Commission for
inquiry into heretical opinions should have found the Fair Maid at
Kinfauns, for our beauty is a peevish, self willed swerver from the
church; and certes, I designed that the knight should have come in
for his share of the fines and confiscations that were about to be
inflicted.The monks were eager enough to be at him, seeing he hath had
frequent disputes with them about the salmon tithe.""But wherefore wouldst thou have ruined the knight's fortunes, and
brought the beautiful young woman to the stake, perchance?"An old woman
might have been in some danger; and as for my Lord Provost, as they call
him, if they had clipped off some of his fat acres, it would have
been some atonement for the needless brave he put on me in St."Methinks, John, it was but a base revenge," said Rothsay.He that cannot right himself by the hand
must use his head.Well, that chance was over by the tender hearted
Douglas's declaring in favour of tender conscience; and then, my lord,
old Henshaw found no further objections to carrying the Fair Maid
of Perth to Falkland, not to share the dulness of the Lady Marjory's
society, as Sir Patrick Charteris and she herself doth opine, but to
keep your Highness from tiring when we return from hunting in the park."There was again a long pause, in which the Prince seemed to muse deeply."Ramorny, I have a scruple in this matter; but if I
name it to thee, the devil of sophistry, with which thou art possessed,
will argue it out of me, as it has done many others.This girl is the
most beautiful, one excepted, whom I ever saw or knew; and I like her
the more that she bears some features of--Elizabeth of Dunbar.But she,
I mean Catharine Glover, is contracted, and presently to be wedded, to
Henry the armourer, a craftsman unequalled for skill, and a man at arms
yet unmatched in the barrace.To follow out this intrigue would do a
good fellow too much wrong.""Your Highness will not expect me to be very solicitous of Henry Smith's
interest," said Ramorny, looking at his wounded arm.Andrew with his shored cross, this disaster of thine is too much
harped upon, John Ramorny!Others are content with putting a finger
into every man's pie, but thou must thrust in thy whole gory hand.It is
done, and cannot be undone; let it be forgotten.""Nay, my lord, you allude to it more frequently than I," answered the
knight--"in derision, it is true; while I--but I can be silent on the
subject if I cannot forget it.""Well, then, I tell thee that I have scruple about this intrigue.Dost
thou remember, when we went in a frolic to hear Father Clement preach,
or rather to see this fair heretic, that he spoke as touchingly as a
minstrel about the rich man taking away the poor man's only ewe lamb?""A great matter, indeed," answered Sir John, "that this churl's wife's
eldest son should be fathered by the Prince of Scotland!How many earls
would covet the like fate for their fair countesses?and how many that
have had such good luck sleep not a grain the worse for it?""And if I might presume to speak," said the mediciner, "the ancient
laws of Scotland assigned such a privilege to every feudal lord over his
female vassals, though lack of spirit and love of money hath made many
exchange it for gold.""I require no argument to urge me to be kind to a pretty woman; but this
Catharine has been ever cold to me," said the Prince."Nay, my lord," said Ramorny, "if, young, handsome, and a prince, you
know not how to make yourself acceptable to a fine woman, it is not for
me to say more.""And if it were not far too great audacity in me to speak again, I would
say," quoth the leech, "that all Perth knows that the Gow Chrom never
was the maiden's choice, but fairly forced upon her by her father.I
know for certain that she refused him repeatedly.""Nay, if thou canst assure us of that, the case is much altered," said
Rothsay."Vulcan was a smith as well as Harry Wynd; he would needs wed
Venus, and our chronicles tell us what came of it.""Then long may Lady Venus live and be worshipped," said Sir John
Ramorny, "and success to the gallant knight Mars who goes a-wooing to
her goddess-ship!"The discourse took a gay and idle turn for a few minutes; but the Duke
of Rothsay soon dropped it."I have left," he said, "yonder air of the
prison house behind me, and yet my spirits scarce revive.I feel that
drowsy, not unpleasing, yet melancholy mood that comes over us when
exhausted by exercise or satiated with pleasure.Some music now,
stealing on the ear, yet not loud enough to make us lift the eye, were a
treat for the gods.""Your Grace has but to speak your wishes, and the nymphs of the Tay are
as favourable as the fair ones upon the shore.said the Duke of Rothsay, listening; "it is, and rarely
touched.Steer towards the boat from
whence the music comes.""It is old Henshaw," said Ramorny, "working up the stream.The boatman answered the hail, and drew up alongside of the Prince's
barge.said the Prince, recognising the figure as well
as the appointments of the French glee woman, Louise."I think I owe
thee something for being the means of thy having a fright, at least,
upon St.Into this boat with thee, lute, puppy dog,
scrip and all; I will prefer thee to a lady's service who shall feed thy
very cur on capons and canary.""I trust your Highness will consider--" said Ramorny."I will consider nothing but my pleasure, John.Pray, do thou be so
complying as to consider it also.""Is it indeed to a lady's service you would promote me?""Oh, I have heard of that great lady!"said Louise; "and will you indeed
prefer me to your right royal consort's service?""I will, by my honour--whenever I receive her as such.Mark that
reservation, John," said he aside to Ramorny.The persons who were in the boat caught up the tidings, and, concluding
a reconciliation was about to take place betwixt the royal couple,
exhorted Louise to profit by her good fortune, and add herself to the
Duchess of Rothsay's train.Several offered her some acknowledgment for
the exercise of her talents.During this moment of delay, Ramorny whispered to Dwining: "Make in,
knave, with some objection.Rouse thy
wits, while I speak a word with Henshaw.""If I might presume to speak," said Dwining, "as one who have made
my studies both in Spain and Arabia, I would say, my lord, that the
sickness has appeared in Edinburgh, and that there may be risk in
admitting this young wanderer into your Highness's vicinity."and what is it to thee," said Rothsay, "whether I choose to be
poisoned by the pestilence or the 'pothecary?Must thou, too, needs
thwart my humour?"While the Prince thus silenced the remonstrances of Dwining, Sir John
Ramorny had snatched a moment to learn from Henshaw that the removal of
the Duchess of Rothsay from Falkland was still kept profoundly secret,
and that Catharine Glover would arrive there that evening or the
next morning, in expectation of being taken under the noble lady's
protection.The Duke of Rothsay, deeply plunged in thought, received this intimation
so coldly, that Ramorny took the liberty of remonstrating."This, my
lord," he said, "is playing the spoiled child of fortune.You wish for
liberty; it comes.You wish for beauty; it awaits you, with just so much
delay as to render the boon more precious.Even your slightest desires
seem a law to the Fates; for you desire music when it seems most
distant, and the lute and song are at your hand.These things, so sent,
should be enjoyed, else we are but like petted children, who break and
throw from them the toys they have wept themselves sick for.""To enjoy pleasure, Ramorny," said the Prince, "a man should have
suffered pain, as it requires fasting to gain a good appetite.We, who
can have all for a wish, little enjoy that all when we have possessed
it.Seest thou yonder thick cloud, which is about to burst to rain?It
seems to stifle me--the waters look dark and lurid--the shores have lost
their beautiful form--"

"My lord, forgive your servant," said Ramorny."You indulge a powerful
imagination, as an unskilful horseman permits a fiery steed to rear
until he falls back on his master and crushes him.I pray you shake off
this lethargy.Shall the glee maiden make some music?""Let her; but it must be melancholy: all mirth would at this moment jar
on my ear."The maiden sung a melancholy dirge in Norman French; the words, of which
the following is an imitation, were united to a tune as doleful as they
are themselves:

     Yes, thou mayst sigh,
     And look once more at all around,
     At stream and bank, and sky and ground.Thy life its final course has found,
     And thou must die.Yes, lay thee down,
     And while thy struggling pulses flutter,
     Bid the grey monk his soul mass mutter,
     And the deep bell its death tone utter--
     Thy life is gone.'Tis but a pang, and then a thrill,
     A fever fit, and then a chill,
     And then an end of human ill,
     For thou art dead.The Prince made no observation on the music; and the maiden, at
Ramorny's beck, went on from time to time with her minstrel craft, until
the evening sunk down into rain, first soft and gentle, at length in
great quantities, and accompanied by a cold wind.There was neither
cloak nor covering for the Prince, and he sullenly rejected that which
Ramorny offered."It is not for Rothsay to wear your cast garments, Sir John; this melted
snow, which I feel pierce me to the very marrow, I am now encountering
by your fault.Why did you presume to put off the boat without my
servants and apparel?"Ramorny did not attempt an exculpation; for he knew the Prince was in
one of those humours, when to enlarge upon a grievance was more pleasing
to him than to have his mouth stopped by any reasonable apology.In
sullen silence, or amid unsuppressed chiding, the boat arrived at the
fishing village of Newburgh.The party landed, and found horses in
readiness, which, indeed, Ramorny had long since provided for the
occasion.Their quality underwent the Prince's bitter sarcasm, expressed
to Ramorny sometimes by direct words, oftener by bitter gibes.At length
they were mounted and rode on through the closing night and the falling
rain, the Prince leading the way with reckless haste.The glee maiden,
mounted by his express order, attended them and well for her that,
accustomed to severe weather, and exercise both on foot and horseback,
she supported as firmly as the men the fatigues of the nocturnal ride.Ramorny was compelled to keep at the Prince's rein, being under no small
anxiety lest, in his wayward fit, he might ride off from him entirely,
and, taking refuge in the house of some loyal baron, escape the snare
which was spread for him.He therefore suffered inexpressibly during the
ride, both in mind and in body.At length the forest of Falkland received them, and a glimpse of the
moon showed the dark and huge tower, an appendage of royalty itself,
though granted for a season to the Duke of Albany.On a signal given the
drawbridge fell.Torches glared in the courtyard, menials attended,
and the Prince, assisted from horseback, was ushered into an apartment,
where Ramorny waited on him, together with Dwining, and entreated him
to take the leech's advice.The Duke of Rothsay repulsed the proposal,
haughtily ordered his bed to be prepared, and having stood for some time
shivering in his dank garments beside a large blazing fire, he retired
to his apartment without taking leave of anyone."You see the peevish humour of this childish boy, now," said Ramorny to
Dwining; "can you wonder that a servant who has done so much for him as
I have should be tired of such a master?""No, truly," said Dwining, "that and the promised earldom of Lindores
would shake any man's fidelity.But shall we commence with him this
evening?He has, if eye and cheek speak true, the foundation of a fever
within him, which will make our work easy while it will seem the effect
of nature.""It is an opportunity lost," said Ramorny; "but we must delay our blow
till he has seen this beauty, Catharine Glover.She may be hereafter a
witness that she saw him in good health, and master of his own motions,
a brief space before--you understand me?"Dwining nodded assent, and added:

"There is no time lost; for there is little difficulty in blighting a
flower exhausted from having been made to bloom too soon."in sooth he was a shameless wight,
     Sore given to revel and ungodly glee:
     Few earthly things found favour in his sight,
     Save concubines and carnal companie,
     And flaunting wassailers of high and low degree.With the next morning the humour of the Duke of Rothsay was changed.He complained, indeed, of pain and fever, but they rather seemed to
stimulate than to overwhelm him.He was familiar with Ramorny, and
though he said nothing on the subject of the preceding night, it was
plain he remembered what he desired to obliterate from the memory of his
followers--the ill humour he had then displayed.He was civil to every
one, and jested with Ramorny on the subject of Catharine's arrival."How surprised will the pretty prude be at seeing herself in a family
of men, when she expects to be admitted amongst the hoods and pinners
of Dame Marjory's waiting women!Thou hast not many of the tender sex in
thy household, I take it, Ramorny?""Faith, none except the minstrel wench, but a household drudge or two
whom we may not dispense with.By the way, she is anxiously inquiring
after the mistress your Highness promised to prefer her to.Shall I
dismiss her, to hunt for her new mistress at leisure?""By no means, she will serve to amuse Catharine.And, hark you, were it
not well to receive that coy jillet with something of a mumming?"We will not disappoint her, since she expects
to find the Duchess of Rothsay: I will be Duke and Duchess in my own
person.""No one so dull as a wit," said the Prince, "when he does not hit off
the scent at once.My Duchess, as they call her, has been in as great a
hurry to run away from Falkland as I to come hither.There is as much female trumpery in the wardrobe
adjoining to my sleeping room as would equip a whole carnival.Look you,
I will play Dame Marjory, disposed on this day bed here with a mourning
veil and a wreath of willow, to show my forsaken plight; thou, John,
wilt look starch and stiff enough for her Galwegian maid of honour,
the Countess Hermigild; and Dwining shall present the old Hecate, her
nurse--only she hath more beard on her upper lip than Dwining on his
whole face, and skull to boot.He should have the commodity of a beard
to set her forth conformably.Get thy kitchen drudges, and what passable
pages thou hast with thee, to make my women of the bedroom.Ramorny hasted into the anteroom, and told Dwining the Prince's device."Do thou look to humour the fool," he said; "I care not how little I see
him, knowing what is to be done.""Trust all to me," said the physician, shrugging his shoulders."What
sort of a butcher is he that can cut the lamb's throat, yet is afraid to
hear it bleat?""Tush, fear not my constancy: I cannot forget that he would have cast
me into the cloister with as little regard as if he threw away the
truncheon of a broken lance.Begone--yet stay; ere you go to arrange
this silly pageant, something must be settled to impose on the thick
witted Charteris.He is like enough, should he be left in the belief
that the Duchess of Rothsay is still here, and Catharine Glover in
attendance on her, to come down with offers of service, and the like,
when, as I need scarce tell thee, his presence would be inconvenient.Indeed, this is the more likely, that some folks have given a warmer
name to the iron headed knight's great and tender patronage of this
damsel.""With that hint, let me alone to deal with him.I will send him such a
letter, that for this month he shall hold himself as ready for a journey
to hell as to Falkland.Can you tell me the name of the Duchess's
confessor?""Waltheof, a grey friar."In a few minutes, for he was a clerk of rare celerity, Dwining finished
a letter, which he placed in Ramorny's hand."This is admirable, and would have made thy fortune with Rothsay.I
think I should have been too jealous to trust thee in his household,
save that his day is closed.""Read it aloud," said Dwining, "that we may judge if it goes trippingly
off."And Ramorny read as follows: "By command of our high and mighty Princess
Marjory, Duchess of Rothsay, and so forth, we Waltheof, unworthy brother
of the order of St.Francis, do thee, Sir Patrick Charteris, knight of
Kinfauns, to know, that her Highness marvels much at the temerity with
which you have sent to her presence a woman of whose fame she can judge
but lightly, seeing she hath made her abode, without any necessity,
for more than a week in thine own castle, without company of any other
female, saving menials; of which foul cohabitation the savour is gone
up through Fife, Angus, and Perthshire.Nevertheless, her Highness,
considering the ease as one of human frailty, hath not caused this
wanton one to be scourged with nettles, or otherwise to dree penance;
but, as two good brethren of the convent of Lindores, the Fathers
Thickskull and Dundermore, have been summoned up to the Highlands upon
an especial call, her Highness hath committed to their care this maiden
Catharine, with charge to convey her to her father, whom she states
to be residing beside Loch Tay, under whose protection she will find
a situation more fitting her qualities and habits than the Castle of
Falkland, while her Highness the Duchess of Rothsay abides there.She
hath charged the said reverend brothers so to deal with the young woman
as may give her a sense of the sin of incontinence, and she commendeth
thee to confession and penitence.--Signed, Waltheof, by command of an
high and mighty Princess"; and so forth.When he had finished, "Excellent--excellent!""This
unexpected rebuff will drive Charteris mad!He hath been long making
a sort of homage to this lady, and to find himself suspected of
incontinence, when he was expecting the full credit of a charitable
action, will altogether confound him; and, as thou say'st, it will be
long enough ere he come hither to look after the damsel or do honour
to the dame.But away to thy pageant, while I prepare that which shall
close the pageant for ever."It was an hour before noon, when Catharine, escorted by old Henshaw and
a groom of the Knight of Kinfauns, arrived before the lordly tower of
Falkland.The broad banner which was displayed from it bore the arms
of Rothsay, the servants who appeared wore the colours of the Prince's
household, all confirming the general belief that the Duchess still
resided there.Catharine's heart throbbed, for she had heard that
the Duchess had the pride as well as the high courage of the house
of Douglas, and felt uncertain touching the reception she was to
experience.On entering the castle, she observed that the train was
smaller than she had expected, but, as the Duchess lived in close
retirement, she was little surprised at this.In a species of anteroom
she was met by a little old woman, who seemed bent double with age, and
supported herself upon an ebony staff."Truly thou art welcome, fair daughter," said she, saluting Catharine,
"and, as I may say, to an afflicted house; and I trust (once more
saluting her) thou wilt be a consolation to my precious and right royal
daughter the Duchess.Sit thee down, my child, till I see whether my
lady be at leisure to receive thee.Ah, my child, thou art very lovely
indeed, if Our Lady hath given to thee a soul to match with so fair a
body."With that the counterfeit old woman crept into the next apartment,
where she found Rothsay in the masquerading habit he had prepared, and
Ramorny, who had evaded taking part in the pageant, in his ordinary
attire."Thou art a precious rascal, sir doctor," said the Prince; "by my
honour, I think thou couldst find in thy heart to play out the whole
play thyself, lover's part and all.""If it were to save your Highness trouble," said the leech, with his
usual subdued laugh."No--no," said Rothsay, "I never need thy help, man; and tell me now,
how look I, thus disposed on the couch--languishing and ladylike, ha?""Something too fine complexioned and soft featured for the Lady Marjory
of Douglas, if I may presume to say so," said the leech."Away, villain, and marshal in this fair frost piece--fear not she will
complain of my effeminacy; and thou, Ramorny, away also."As the knight left the apartment by one door, the fictitious old woman
ushered in Catharine Glover by another.The room had been carefully
darkened to twilight, so that Catharine saw the apparently female figure
stretched on the couch without the least suspicion.asked Rothsay, in a voice naturally sweet, and now
carefully modulated to a whispering tone."Let her approach, Griselda,
and kiss our hand."The supposed nurse led the trembling maiden forward to the side of the
couch, and signed to her to kneel.Catharine did so, and kissed with
much devotion and simplicity the gloved hand which the counterfeit
duchess extended to her."Be not afraid," said the same musical voice; "in me you only see a
melancholy example of the vanity of human greatness; happy those, my
child, whose rank places them beneath the storms of state."While he spoke, he put his arms around her neck and drew her towards
him, as if to salute her in token of welcome.But the kiss was bestowed
with an earnestness which so much overacted the part of the fair
patroness, that Catharine, concluding the Duchess had lost her senses,
screamed aloud.Catharine looked around her; the nurse was gone, and the Duke tearing
off his veil, she saw herself in the power of a daring young libertine.she said; "and Thou wilt, if I forsake
not myself."As this resolution darted through her mind, she repressed her
disposition to scream, and, as far as she might, strove to conceal her
fear."The jest hath been played," she said, with as much firmness as she
could assume; "may I entreat that your Highness will now unhand me?"for
he still kept hold of her arm."Nay, my pretty captive, struggle not--why should you fear?"As you are pleased to detain me, I will
not, by striving, provoke you to use me ill, and give pain to yourself,
when you have time to think.""Why, thou traitress, thou hast held me captive for months," said the
Prince, "and wilt thou not let me hold thee for a moment?""This were gallantry, my lord, were it in the streets of Perth, where I
might listen or escape as I listed; it is tyranny here.""And if I did let thee go, whither wouldst thou fly?""The bridges are up, the portcullis down, and the men who follow me are
strangely deaf to a peevish maiden's squalls.Be kind, therefore, and
you shall know what it is to oblige a prince.""Unloose me, then, my lord, and hear me appeal from thyself to thyself,
from Rothsay to the Prince of Scotland.I am the daughter of an humble
but honest citizen.I am, I may well nigh say, the spouse of a brave and
honest man.If I have given your Highness any encouragement for what you
have done, it has been unintentional.Thus forewarned, I entreat you to
forego your power over me, and suffer me to depart.Your Highness can
obtain nothing from me, save by means equally unworthy of knighthood or
manhood.""You are bold, Catharine," said the Prince, "but neither as a knight
nor a man can I avoid accepting a defiance.I must teach you the risk of
such challenges."While he spoke, he attempted to throw his arms again around her; but she
eluded his grasp, and proceeded in the same tone of firm decision."My strength, my lord, is as great to defend myself in an honourable
strife as yours can be to assail me with a most dishonourable purpose.Do not shame yourself and me by putting it to the combat.You may stun
me with blows, or you may call aid to overpower me; but otherwise you
will fail of your purpose.""The force I would
use is no more than excuses women in yielding to their own weakness.""Then keep it," said Catharine, "for those women who desire such an
excuse.My resistance is that of the most determined mind which love
of honour and fear of shame ever inspired.my lord, could you
succeed, you would but break every bond between me and life, between
yourself and honour.I have been trained fraudulently here, by what
decoys I know not; but were I to go dishonoured hence, it would be to
denounce the destroyer of my happiness to every quarter of Europe.I would take the palmer's staff in my hand, and wherever chivalry is
honoured, or the word Scotland has been heard, I would proclaim the heir
of a hundred kings, the son of the godly Robert Stuart, the heir of
the heroic Bruce, a truthless, faithless man, unworthy of the crown he
expects and of the spurs he wears.Every lady in wide Europe would hold
your name too foul for her lips; every worthy knight would hold you
a baffled, forsworn caitiff, false to the first vow of arms, the
protection of woman and the defence of the feeble."Rothsay resumed his seat, and looked at her with a countenance in which
resentment was mingled with admiration."You forget to whom you speak,
maiden.Know, the distinction I have offered you is one for which
hundreds whose trains you are born to bear would feel gratitude.""Once more, my lord," resumed Catharine, "keep these favours for those
by whom they are prized; or rather reserve your time and your health
for other and nobler pursuits--for the defence of your country and
the happiness of your subjects.Alas, my lord, how willingly would an
exulting people receive you for their chief!How gladly would they close
around you, did you show desire to head them against the oppression of
the mighty, the violence of the lawless, the seduction of the vicious,
and the tyranny of the hypocrite!"The Duke of Rothsay, whose virtuous feelings were as easily excited
as they were evanescent, was affected by the enthusiasm with which she
spoke."Forgive me if I have alarmed you, maiden," he said "thou art
too noble minded to be the toy of passing pleasure, for which my mistake
destined thee; and I, even were thy birth worthy of thy noble spirit and
transcendent beauty, have no heart to give thee; for by the homage of
the heart only should such as thou be wooed.But my hopes have been
blighted, Catharine: the only woman I ever loved has been torn from me
in the very wantonness of policy, and a wife imposed on me whom I must
ever detest, even had she the loveliness and softness which alone can
render a woman amiable in my eyes.My health is fading even in early
youth; and all that is left for me is to snatch such flowers as the
short passage from life to the grave will now present.Look at my hectic
cheek; feel, if you will, my intermitting pulse; and pity me and excuse
me if I, whose rights as a prince and as a man have been trampled upon
and usurped, feel occasional indifference towards the rights of others,
and indulge a selfish desire to gratify the wish of the passing moment."exclaimed Catharine, with the enthusiasm which belonged
to her character--"I will call you my dear lord, for dear must the heir
of Bruce be to every child of Scotland--let me not, I pray, hear you
speak thus!Your glorious ancestor endured exile, persecution, the night
of famine, and the day of unequal combat, to free his country; do you
practise the like self denial to free yourself.Tear yourself from those
who find their own way to greatness smoothed by feeding your follies.You know it not, I am sure--you could not
know; but the wretch who could urge the daughter to courses of shame by
threatening the life of the aged father is capable of all that is vile,
all that is treacherous!""He did indeed, my lord, and he dares not deny it.""It shall be looked to," answered the Duke of Rothsay."I have ceased
to love him; but he has suffered much for my sake, and I must see his
services honourably requited."Oh, my lord, if chronicles speak true, such services
brought Troy to ruins and gave the infidels possession of Spain.""Hush, maiden--speak within compass, I pray you," said the Prince,
rising up; "our conference ends here.""Yet one word, my Lord Duke of Rothsay," said Catharine, with animation,
while her beautiful countenance resembled that of an admonitory angel."I cannot tell what impels me to speak thus boldly; but the fire burns
within me, and will break out.Leave this castle without an hour's
delay; the air is unwholesome for you.Dismiss this Ramorny before the
day is ten minutes older; his company is most dangerous.""None in especial," answered Catharine, abashed at her own
eagerness--"none, perhaps, excepting my fears for your safety.""To vague fears the heir of Bruce must not listen.Ramorny entered, and bowed low to the Duke and to the maiden, whom,
perhaps, he considered as likely to be preferred to the post of
favourite sultana, and therefore entitled to a courteous obeisance."Ramorny," said the Prince, "is there in the household any female of
reputation who is fit to wait on this young woman till we can send her
where she may desire to go?""I fear," replied Ramorny, "if it displease not your Highness to hear
the truth, your household is indifferently provided in that way; and
that, to speak the very verity, the glee maiden is the most decorous
amongst us.""Let her wait upon this young person, then, since better may not be.And
take patience, maiden, for a few hours.""So, my lord, part you so soon from the Fair Maid of Perth?This is,
indeed, the very wantonness of victory.""There is neither victory nor defeat in the case," returned the Prince,
drily."The girl loves me not; nor do I love her well enough to torment
myself concerning her scruples.""The chaste Malcolm the Maiden revived in one of his descendants!""Favour me, sir, by a truce to your wit, or by choosing a different
subject for its career.It is noon, I believe, and you will oblige me by
commanding them to serve up dinner."Ramorny left the room; but Rothsay thought he discovered a smile upon
his countenance, and to be the subject of this man's satire gave him no
ordinary degree of pain.He summoned, however, the knight to his table,
and even admitted Dwining to the same honour.The conversation was of
a lively and dissolute cast, a tone encouraged by the Prince, as if
designing to counterbalance the gravity of his morals in the morning,
which Ramorny, who was read in old chronicles, had the boldness to liken
to the continence of Scipio.The banquet, nothwithstanding the Duke's indifferent health, was
protracted in idle wantonness far beyond the rules of temperance; and,
whether owing simply to the strength of the wine which he drank, or the
weakness of his constitution, or, as it is probable, because the last
wine which he quaffed had been adulterated by Dwining, it so happened
that the Prince, towards the end of the repast, fell into a lethargic
sleep, from which it seemed impossible to rouse him.Sir John Ramorny
and Dwining carried him to his chamber, accepting no other assistance
than that of another person, whom we will afterwards give name to.Next morning, it was announced that the Prince was taken ill of
an infectious disorder; and, to prevent its spreading through the
household, no one was admitted to wait on him save his late master of
horse, the physician Dwining, and the domestic already mentioned; one of
whom seemed always to remain in the apartment, while the others observed
a degree of precaution respecting their intercourse with the rest of the
family, so strict as to maintain the belief that he was dangerously ill
of an infectious disorder.In winter's tedious nights, sit by the fire,
     With good old folks, and let them tell thee tales
     Of woeful ages, long ago betid:
     And, ere thou bid goodnight, to quit their grief,
     Tell thou the lamentable fall of me.King Richard II Act V. Scene I.


Far different had been the fate of the misguided heir of Scotland from
that which was publicly given out in the town of Falkland.His ambitious
uncle had determined on his death, as the means of removing the first
and most formidable barrier betwixt his own family and the throne.James, the younger son of the King, was a mere boy, who might at more
leisure be easily set aside.Ramorny's views of aggrandisement, and the
resentment which he had latterly entertained against his masters made
him a willing agent in young Rothsay's destruction.Dwining's love of
gold, and his native malignity of disposition, rendered him equally
forward.It had been resolved, with the most calculating cruelty,
that all means which might leave behind marks of violence were to be
carefully avoided, and the extinction of life suffered to take place
of itself by privation of every kind acting upon a frail and impaired
constitution.The Prince of Scotland was not to be murdered, as Ramorny
had expressed himself on another occasion, he was only to cease to
exist.Rothsay's bedchamber in the Tower of Falkland was well adapted
for the execution of such a horrible project.A small, narrow staircase,
scarce known to exist, opened from thence by a trapdoor to the
subterranean dungeons of the castle, through a passage by which
the feudal lord was wont to visit, in private and in disguise, the
inhabitants of those miserable regions.By this staircase the villains
conveyed the insensible Prince to the lowest dungeon of the castle,
so deep in the bowels of the earth, that no cries or groans, it was
supposed, could possibly be heard, while the strength of its door and
fastenings must for a long time have defied force, even if the entrance
could have been discovered.Bonthron, who had been saved from the
gallows for the purpose, was the willing agent of Ramorny's unparalleled
cruelty to his misled and betrayed patron.This wretch revisited the dungeon at the time when the Prince's lethargy
began to wear off, and when, awaking to sensation, he felt himself
deadly cold, unable to move, and oppressed with fetters, which scarce
permitted him to stir from the dank straw on which he was laid.His
first idea was that he was in a fearful dream, his next brought a
confused augury of the truth.He called, shouted, yelled at length in
frenzy but no assistance came, and he was only answered by the vaulted
roof of the dungeon.The agent of hell heard these agonizing screams,
and deliberately reckoned them against the taunts and reproaches with
which Rothsay had expressed his instinctive aversion to him.When,
exhausted and hopeless, the unhappy youth remained silent, the savage
resolved to present himself before the eyes of his prisoner.The locks
were drawn, the chain fell; the Prince raised himself as high as his
fetters permitted; a red glare, against which he was fain to shut his
eyes, streamed through the vault; and when he opened them again, it was
on the ghastly form of one whom he had reason to think dead."I am judged and condemned," he exclaimed, "and the most abhorred fiend
in the infernal regions is sent to torment me!""I live, my lord," said Bonthron; "and that you may live and enjoy life,
be pleased to sit up and eat your victuals.""Free me from these irons," said the Prince, "release me from this
dungeon, and, dog as thou art, thou shalt be the richest man in
Scotland.""If you would give me the weight of your shackles in gold," said
Bonthron, "I would rather see the iron on you than have the treasure
myself!But look up; you were wont to love delicate fare--behold how I
have catered for you."The wretch, with fiendish glee, unfolded a piece of rawhide covering the
bundle which he bore under' his arm, and, passing the light to and fro
before it, showed the unhappy Prince a bull's head recently hewn from
the trunk, and known in Scotland as the certain signal of death.He
placed it at the foot of the bed, or rather lair, on which the Prince
lay."Be moderate in your food," he said; "it is like to be long ere thou
getst another meal.""Tell me but one thing, wretch," said the Prince."Does Ramorny know of
this practice?""How else hadst thou been decoyed hither?Poor woodcock, thou art
snared!"With these words, the door shut, the bolts resounded, and the unhappy
Prince was left to darkness, solitude, and misery."Oh, my father!--my
prophetic father!The staff I leaned on has indeed proved a spear!"We will not dwell on the subsequent hours, nay, days, of bodily agony
and mental despair.But it was not the pleasure of Heaven that so great a crime should be
perpetrated with impunity.Catharine Glover and the glee woman, neglected by the other inmates,
who seemed to be engaged with the tidings of the Prince's illness, were,
however, refused permission to leave the castle until it should be seen
how this alarming disease was to terminate, and whether it was actually
an infectious sickness.Forced on each other's society, the two desolate
women became companions, if not friends; and the union drew somewhat
closer when Catharine discovered that this was the same female minstrel
on whose account Henry Wynd had fallen under her displeasure.She now
heard his complete vindication, and listened with ardour to the praises
which Louise heaped on her gallant protector.On the other hand, the
minstrel, who felt the superiority of Catharine's station and character,
willingly dwelt upon a theme which seemed to please her, and recorded
her gratitude to the stout smith in the little song of "Bold and True,"
which was long a favourite in Scotland.Oh, bold and true,
     In bonnet blue,
     That fear or falsehood never knew,
     Whose heart was loyal to his word,
     Whose hand was faithful to his sword--
     Seek Europe wide from sea to sea,
     But bonny blue cap still for me!I've seen Almain's proud champions prance,
     Have seen the gallant knights of France,
     Unrivall'd with the sword and lance,
     Have seen the sons of England true,
     Wield the brown bill and bend the yew.Search France the fair, and England free,
     But bonny blue cap still for me!In short, though Louise's disreputable occupation would have been in
other circumstances an objection to Catharine's voluntarily frequenting
her company, yet, forced together as they now were, she found her a
humble and accommodating companion.They lived in this manner for four or five days, and, in order to avoid
as much as possible the gaze, and perhaps the incivility, of the menials
in the offices, they prepared their food in their own apartment.In the
absolutely necessary intercourse with domestics, Louise, more accustomed
to expedients, bolder by habit, and desirous to please Catharine,
willingly took on herself the trouble of getting from the pantler the
materials of their slender meal, and of arranging it with the dexterity
of her country.The glee woman had been abroad for this purpose upon the sixth day, a
little before noon; and the desire of fresh air, or the hope to find
some sallad or pot herbs, or at least an early flower or two, with which
to deck their board, had carried her into the small garden appertaining
to the castle.She re-entered her apartment in the tower with a
countenance pale as ashes, and a frame which trembled like an aspen
leaf.Her terror instantly extended itself to Catharine, who could
hardly find words to ask what new misfortune had occurred.said Louise, speaking under her breath, and huddling
her words so thick upon each other that Catharine could hardly catch
the sense."I was seeking for flowers to dress your pottage, because
you said you loved them yesterday; my poor little dog, thrusting himself
into a thicket of yew and holly bushes that grow out of some old ruins
close to the castle wall, came back whining and howling.I crept forward
to see what might be the cause--and, oh!I heard a groaning as of one
in extreme pain, but so faint, that it seemed to arise out of the very
depth of the earth.At length, I found it proceeded from a small rent in
the wall, covered with ivy; and when I laid my ear close to the opening,
I could hear the Prince's voice distinctly say, 'It cannot now last
long'--and then it sunk away in something like a prayer.""I said, 'Is it you, my lord?'and the answer was, 'Who mocks me with
that title?'I asked him if I could help him, and he answered with a
voice I shall never forget, 'Food--food!So I came
hither to tell you.that were more likely to destroy than to aid," said Catharine."I know not yet," said Catharine, prompt and bold on occasions of
moment, though yielding to her companion in ingenuity of resource on
ordinary occasions: "I know not yet, but something we will do: the blood
of Bruce shall not die unaided."So saying, she seized the small cruise which contained their soup, and
the meat of which it was made, wrapped some thin cakes which she had
baked into the fold of her plaid, and, beckoning her companion to follow
with a vessel of milk, also part of their provisions, she hastened
towards the garden."So, our fair vestal is stirring abroad?"said the only man she met, who
was one of the menials; but Catharine passed on without notice or reply,
and gained the little garden without farther interruption.Louise indicated to her a heap of ruins, which, covered with underwood,
was close to the castle wall.It had probably been originally a
projection from the building; and the small fissure, which communicated
with the dungeon, contrived for air, had terminated within it.But the
aperture had been a little enlarged by decay, and admitted a dim ray of
light to its recesses, although it could not be observed by those who
visited the place with torchlight aids."Here is dead silence," said Catharine, after she had listened
attentively for a moment."Heaven and earth, he is gone!""We must risk something," said her companion, and ran her fingers over
the strings of her guitar.A sigh was the only answer from the depth of the dungeon."I am here, my lord--I am here, with food and drink."The jest comes too late; I am dying," was the answer."His brain is turned, and no wonder," thought Catharine; "but whilst
there is life, there may be hope.""It is I, my lord, Catharine Glover.I have food, if I could pass it
safely to you."I thought the pain was over, but it glows
again within me at the name of food.""The food is here, but how--ah, how can I pass it to you?the chink
is so narrow, the wall is so thick!Yet there is a remedy--I have it.Quick, Louise; cut me a willow bough, the tallest you can find."The glee maiden obeyed, and, by means of a cleft in the top of the
wand, Catharine transmitted several morsels of the soft cakes, soaked in
broth, which served at once for food and for drink.The unfortunate young man ate little, and with difficulty, but prayed
for a thousand blessings on the head of his comforter."I had destined
thee to be the slave of my vices," he said, "and yet thou triest to
become the preserver of my life!"I will return with food as I shall see opportunity," said Catharine,
just as the glee maiden plucked her sleeve and desired her to be silent
and stand close.Both crouched among the ruins, and they heard the voices of Ramorny and
the mediciner in close conversation."He is stronger than I thought," said the former, in a low, croaking
tone."How long held out Dalwolsy, when the knight of Liddesdale
prisoned him in his castle of Hermitage?""For a fortnight," answered Dwining; "but he was a strong man, and had
some assistance by grain which fell from a granary above his prison
house.""Were it not better end the matter more speedily?He will demand to see the
Prince, and all must be over ere he comes."They passed on in their dark and fatal conversation."Now gain we the tower," said Catharine to her companion, when she saw
they had left the garden."I had a plan of escape for myself; I will
turn it into one of rescue for the Prince.The dey woman enters the
castle about vesper time, and usually leaves her cloak in the passage as
she goes into the pantlers' office with the milk.Take thou the cloak,
muffle thyself close, and pass the warder boldly; he is usually drunken
at that hour, and thou wilt go as the dey woman unchallenged through
gate and along bridge, if thou bear thyself with confidence.Then away
to meet the Black Douglas; he is our nearest and only aid.""But," said Louise, "is he not that terrible lord who threatened me with
shame and punishment?""Believe it," said Catharine, "such as thou or I never dwelt an hour in
the Douglas's memory, either for good or evil.Tell him that his son in
law, the Prince of Scotland dies--treacherously famished--in Falkland
Castle, and thou wilt merit not pardon only, but reward.""I care not for reward," said Louise; "the deed will reward itself.But
methinks to stay is more dangerous than to go.Let me stay, then, and
nourish the unhappy Prince, and do you depart to bring help.If they
kill me before you return, I leave you my poor lute, and pray you to be
kind to my poor Charlot.""No, Louise," replied Catharine, "you are a more privileged and
experienced wanderer than I--do you go; and if you find me dead on your
return, as may well chance, give my poor father this ring and a lock of
my hair, and say, Catharine died in endeavouring to save the blood of
Bruce.And give this other lock to Henry; say, Catharine thought of him
to the last, and that, if he has judged her too scrupulous touching the
blood of others, he will then know it was not because she valued her
own."They sobbed in each other's arms, and the intervening hours till evening
were spent in endeavouring to devise some better mode of supplying the
captive with nourishment, and in the construction of a tube, composed
of hollow reeds, slipping into each other, by which liquids might be
conveyed to him.The bell of the village church of Falkland tolled to
vespers.The dey, or farm woman, entered with her pitchers to deliver
the milk for the family, and to hear and tell the news stirring.She had
scarcely entered the kitchen when the female minstrel, again throwing
herself in Catharine's arms, and assuring her of her unalterable
fidelity, crept in silence downstairs, the little dog under her arm.A
moment after, she was seen by the breathless Catharine, wrapt in the dey
woman's cloak, and walking composedly across the drawbridge."So," said the warder, "you return early tonight, May Bridget?Small
mirth towards in the hall--ha, wench!"I have forgotten my tallies," said the ready witted French woman, "and
will return in the skimming of a bowie."She went onward, avoiding the village of Falkland, and took a footpath
which led through the park.Catharine breathed freely, and blessed God
when she saw her lost in the distance.It was another anxious hour
for Catharine which occurred before the escape of the fugitive was
discovered.This happened so soon as the dey girl, having taken an hour
to perform a task which ten minutes might have accomplished, was about
to return, and discovered that some one had taken away her grey frieze
cloak.A strict search was set on foot; at length the women of the
house remembered the glee maiden, and ventured to suggest her as one not
unlikely to exchange an old cloak for a new one.The warder, strictly
questioned, averred he saw the dey woman depart immediately after
vespers; and on this being contradicted by the party herself, he could
suggest, as the only alternative, that it must needs have been the
devil.As, however, the glee woman could not be found, the real circumstances
of the case were easily guessed at; and the steward went to inform Sir
John Ramorny and Dwining, who were now scarcely ever separate, of
the escape of one of their female captives.Everything awakens the
suspicions of the guilty.They looked on each other with faces of
dismay, and then went together to the humble apartment of Catharine,
that they might take her as much as possible by surprise while they
inquired into the facts attending Louise's disappearance.said Ramorny, in a tone of
austere gravity."I have no companion here," answered Catharine."Trifle not," replied the knight; "I mean the glee maiden, who lately
dwelt in this chamber with you.""She is gone, they tell me," said Catharine--"gone about an hour since.""How," answered Catharine, "should I know which way a professed wanderer
may choose to travel?She was tired no doubt of a solitary life, so
different from the scenes of feasting and dancing which her trade leads
her to frequent.She is gone, and the only wonder is that she should
have stayed so long.""This, then," said Ramorny, "is all you have to tell us?""All that I have to tell you, Sir John," answered Catharine, firmly;
"and if the Prince himself inquire, I can tell him no more.""There is little danger of his again doing you the honour to speak to
you in person," said Ramorny, "even if Scotland should escape being
rendered miserable by the sad event of his decease.""Is the Duke of Rothsay so very ill?""No help, save in Heaven," answered Ramorny, looking upward."Then may there yet be help there," said Catharine, "if human aid prove
unavailing!"said Ramorny, with the most determined gravity; while Dwining
adopted a face fit to echo the feeling, though it seemed to cost him
a painful struggle to suppress his sneering yet soft laugh of triumph,
which was peculiarly excited by anything having a religious tendency."And it is men--earthly men, and not incarnate devils, who thus appeal
to Heaven, while they are devouring by inches the life blood of their
hapless master!"muttered Catharine, as her two baffled inquisitors left
the apartment.But it will roll ere long, and
oh!may it be to preserve as well as to punish!"The hour of dinner alone afforded a space when, all in the castle being
occupied with that meal, Catharine thought she had the best opportunity
of venturing to the breach in the wall, with the least chance of being
observed.In waiting for the hour, she observed some stir in the castle,
which had been silent as the grave ever since the seclusion of the Duke
of Rothsay.The portcullis was lowered and raised, and the creaking of
the machinery was intermingled with the tramp of horse, as men at arms
went out and returned with steeds hard ridden and covered with foam.She
observed, too, that such domestics as she casually saw from her window
were in arms.All this made her heart throb high, for it augured the
approach of rescue; and besides, the bustle left the little garden more
lonely than ever.At length the hour of noon arrived; she had taken care
to provide, under pretence of her own wishes, which the pantler seemed
disposed to indulge, such articles of food as could be the most easily
conveyed to the unhappy captive.She whispered to intimate her presence;
there was no answer; she spoke louder, still there was silence."He sleeps," she muttered these words half aloud, and with a shuddering
which was succeeded by a start and a scream, when a voice replied behind
her:

"Yes, he sleeps; but it is for ever."Sir John Ramorny stood behind her in complete armour,
but the visor of his helmet was up, and displayed a countenance more
resembling one about to die than to fight.He spoke with a grave tone,
something between that of a calm observer of an interesting event and of
one who is an agent and partaker in it."Catharine," he said, "all is true which I tell you.You
have done your best for him; you can do no more.""I will not--I cannot believe it," said Catharine."Heaven be merciful
to me!it would make one doubt of Providence, to think so great a crime
has been accomplished.""Doubt not of Providence, Catharine, though it has suffered the
profligate to fall by his own devices.Follow me; I have that to say
which concerns you.I say follow (for she hesitated), unless you prefer
being left to the mercies of the brute Bonthron and the mediciner
Henbane Dwining.""I will follow you," said Catharine."You cannot do more to me than you
are permitted."He led the way into the tower, and mounted staircase after staircase and
ladder after ladder."I will follow no farther," she said.If to my death, I can die here.""Only to the battlements of the castle, fool," said Ramorny, throwing
wide a barred door which opened upon the vaulted roof of the castle,
where men were bending mangonels, as they called them (military engines,
that is, for throwing arrows or stones), getting ready crossbows, and
piling stones together.But the defenders did not exceed twenty in
number, and Catharine thought she could observe doubt and irresolution
amongst them."Catharine," said Ramorny, "I must not quit this station, which is
necessary for my defence; but I can speak with you here as well as
elsewhere.""Say on," answered Catharine, "I am prepared to hear you.""You have thrust yourself, Catharine, into a bloody secret.Have you the
firmness to keep it?""I do not understand you, Sir John," answered the maiden.I have slain--murdered, if you will--my late master, the Duke
of Rothsay.The spark of life which your kindness would have fed
was easily smothered.You are
faint--bear up--you have more to hear.You know the crime, but you know
not the provocation.this gauntlet is empty; I lost my right hand
in his cause, and when I was no longer fit to serve him, I was cast off
like a worn out hound, my loss ridiculed, and a cloister recommended,
instead of the halls and palaces in which I had my natural sphere!Think
on this--pity and assist me.""In what manner can you require my assistance?"said the trembling
maiden; "I can neither repair your loss nor cancel your crime.""Thou canst be silent, Catharine, on what thou hast seen and heard in
yonder thicket.It is but a brief oblivion I ask of you, whose word
will, I know, be listened to, whether you say such things were or were
not.That of your mountebank companion, the foreigner, none will hold
to be of a pin point's value.If you grant me this, I will take your
promise for my security, and throw the gate open to those who now
approach it.If you will not promise silence, I defend this castle till
every one perishes, and I fling you headlong from these battlements.Ay, look at them--it is not a leap to be rashly braved.Seven courses of
stairs brought you up hither with fatigue and shortened breath; but you
shall go from the top to the bottom in briefer time than you can breathe
a sigh!Speak the word, fair maid; for you speak to one unwilling to
harm you, but determined in his purpose."Catharine stood terrified, and without power of answering a man who
seemed so desperate; but she was saved the necessity of reply by the
approach of Dwining.He spoke with the same humble conges which at all
times distinguished his manner, and with his usual suppressed ironical
sneer, which gave that manner the lie."I do you wrong, noble sir, to intrude on your valiancie when engaged
with a fair damsel.But I come to ask a trifling question."said Ramorny; "ill news are sport to thee even when
they affect thyself, so that they concern others also.""Hem!--he, he!--I only desired to know if your knighthood proposed the
chivalrous task of defending the castle with your single hand--I crave
pardon, I meant your single arm?The question is worth asking, for I
am good for little to aid the defence, unless you could prevail on the
besiegers to take physic--he, he, he!--and Bonthron is as drunk as ale
and strong waters can make him; and you, he, and I make up the whole
garrison who are disposed for resistance.""Never saw men who showed less stomach to the work," answered
Dwining--"never.Eviot and his companion Buncle now approached, with sullen resolution
in their faces, like men who had made their minds up to resist that
authority which they had so long obeyed.said Ramorny, stepping forward to meet them.Why have you left the barbican, Eviot?And you other fellow,
did I not charge you to look to the mangonels?""We have something to tell you, Sir John Ramorny," answered Eviot."We
will not fight in this quarrel.""How--my own squires control me?""We were your squires and pages, my lord, while you were master of the
Duke of Rothsay's household.It is bruited about the Duke no longer
lives; we desire to know the truth.""What traitor dares spread such falsehoods?""All who have gone out to skirt the forest, my lord, and I myself among
others, bring back the same news.The minstrel woman who left the castle
yesterday has spread the report everywhere that the Duke of Rothsay
is murdered, or at death's door.The Douglas comes on us with a strong
force--"

"And you, cowards, take advantage of an idle report to forsake your
master?""My lord," said Eviot, "let Buncle and myself see the Duke of Rothsay,
and receive his personal orders for defence of this castle, and if we do
not fight to the death in that quarrel, I will consent to be hanged on
its highest turret.But if he be gone by natural disease, we will yield
up the castle to the Earl of Douglas, who is, they say, the King's
lieutenant.Or if--which Heaven forefend!--the noble Prince has had
foul play, we will not involve ourselves in the guilt of using arms in
defence of the murderers, be they who they will.""Eviot," said Ramorny, raising his mutilated arm, "had not that glove
been empty, thou hadst not lived to utter two words of this insolence.""It is as it is," answered Evict, "and we do but our duty.I have
followed you long, my lord, but here I draw bridle.""Farewell, then, and a curse light on all of you!""Our valiancie is about to run away," said the mediciner, who had crept
close to Catharine's side before she was aware."Catharine, thou art a
superstitious fool, like most women; nevertheless thou hast some mind,
and I speak to thee as one of more understanding than the buffaloes
which are herding about us.These haughty barons who overstride the
world, what are they in the day of adversity?Let
their sledge hammer hands or their column resembling legs have injury,
and bah!Heart and courage is nothing to
them, lith and limb everything: give them animal strength, what are they
better than furious bulls; take that away, and your hero of chivalry
lies grovelling like the brute when he is hamstrung.Not so the sage;
while a grain of sense remains in a crushed or mutilated frame, his mind
shall be strong as ever.Catharine, this morning I was practising your
death; but methinks I now rejoice that you may survive to tell how the
poor mediciner, the pill gilder, the mortar pounder, the poison vender,
met his fate, in company with the gallant Knight of Ramorny, Baron in
possession and Earl of Lindores in expectation--God save his lordship!""Old man," said Catharine, "if thou be indeed so near the day of thy
deserved doom, other thoughts were far wholesomer than the vainglorious
ravings of a vain philosophy.Ask to see a holy man--"

"Yes," said Dwining, scornfully, "refer myself to a greasy monk, who
does not--he!he!--understand the barbarous Latin he repeats by
rote.Such would be a fitting counsellor to one who has studied both
in Spain and Arabia!No, Catharine, I will choose a confessor that is
pleasant to look upon, and you shall be honoured with the office.Now,
look yonder at his valiancie, his eyebrow drops with moisture, his lip
trembles with agony; for his valiancie--he!he!--is pleading for his
life with his late domestics, and has not eloquence enough to persuade
them to let him slip.See how the fibres of his face work as he implores
the ungrateful brutes, whom he has heaped with obligations, to permit
him to get such a start for his life as the hare has from the greyhounds
when men course her fairly.Look also at the sullen, downcast, dogged
faces with which, fluctuating between fear and shame, the domestic
traitors deny their lord this poor chance for his life.These things
thought themselves the superior of a man like me!and you, foolish
wench, think so meanly of your Deity as to suppose wretches like them
are the work of Omnipotence!"said Catharine, warmly; "the God I worship
created these men with the attributes to know and adore Him, to guard
and defend their fellow creatures, to practise holiness and virtue.Their own vices, and the temptations of the Evil One, have made them
such as they now are.Oh, take the lesson home to thine own heart of
adamant!Heaven made thee wiser than thy fellows, gave thee eyes to look
into the secrets of nature, a sagacious heart, and a skilful hand; but
thy pride has poisoned all these fair gifts, and made an ungodly atheist
of one who might have been a Christian sage!""Atheist, say'st thou?""Perhaps I have doubts on that
matter--but they will be soon solved.Yonder comes one who will send
me, as he has done thousands, to the place where all mysteries shall be
cleared."Catharine followed the mediciner's eye up one of the forest glades, and
beheld it occupied by a body of horsemen advancing at full gallop.In
the midst was a pennon displayed, which, though its bearings were not
visible to Catharine, was, by a murmur around, acknowledged as that of
the Black Douglas.They halted within arrow shot of the castle, and a
herald with two trumpets advanced up to the main portal, where, after a
loud flourish, he demanded admittance for the high and dreaded Archibald
Earl of Douglas, Lord Lieutenant of the King, and acting for the time
with the plenary authority of his Majesty; commanding, at the same time,
that the inmates of the castle should lay down their arms, all under
penalty of high treason.said Eviot to Ramorny, who stood sullen and undecided."Will
you give orders to render the castle, or must I?"interrupted the knight, "to the last I will command you.Open the gates, drop the bridge, and render the castle to the Douglas.""Now, that's what may be called a gallant exertion of free will," said
Dwining."Just as if the pieces of brass that were screaming a minute
since should pretend to call those notes their own which are breathed
through them by a frowsy trumpeter."said Catharine, "either be silent or turn thy thoughts
to the eternity on the brink of which thou art standing.""Thou canst not, wench,
help hearing what I say to thee, and thou wilt tell it again, for thy
sex cannot help that either.Perth and all Scotland shall know what a
man they have lost in Henbane Dwining!"The clash of armour now announced that the newcomers had dismounted and
entered the castle, and were in the act of disarming the small garrison.Earl Douglas himself appeared on the battlements, with a few of his
followers, and signed to them to take Ramorny and Dwining into custody.Others dragged from some nook the stupefied Bonthron."It was to these three that the custody of the Prince was solely
committed daring his alleged illness?"said the Douglas, prosecuting an
inquiry which he had commenced in the hall of the castle."No other saw him, my lord," said Eviot, "though I offered my services.""Conduct us to the Duke's apartment, and bring the prisoners with
us.Also should there be a female in the castle, if she hath not been
murdered or spirited away--the companion of the glee maiden who brought
the first alarm.""She is here, my lord," said Eviot, bringing Catharine forward.Her beauty and her agitation made some impression even upon the
impassible Earl."Fear nothing, maiden," he said; "thou hast deserved both praise and
reward.Tell to me, as thou wouldst confess to Heaven, the things thou
hast witnessed in this castle."Few words served Catharine to unfold the dreadful story."It agrees," said the Douglas, "with the tale of the glee maiden, from
point to point.They passed to the room which the unhappy Duke of Rothsay had been
supposed to inhabit; but the key was not to be found, and the Earl could
only obtain entrance by forcing the door.On entering, the wasted and
squalid remains of the unhappy Prince were discovered, flung on the bed
as if in haste.The intention of the murderers had apparently been to
arrange the dead body so as to resemble a timely parted corpse, but they
had been disconcerted by the alarm occasioned by the escape of Louise.Douglas looked on the body of the misguided youth, whose wild passions
and caprices had brought him to this fatal and premature catastrophe."I had wrongs to be redressed," he said; "but to see such a sight as
this banishes all remembrance of injury!"It should have been arranged," said Dwining, "more to your
omnipotence's pleasure; but you came suddenly on us, and hasty masters
make slovenly service."Douglas seemed not to hear what his prisoner said, so closely did he
examine the wan and wasted features, and stiffened limbs, of the dead
body before him.Catharine, overcome by sickness and fainting, at length
obtained permission to retire from the dreadful scene, and, through
confusion of every description, found her way to her former apartment,
where she was locked in the arms of Louise, who had returned in the
interval.The dying hand of the Prince
was found to be clenched upon a lock of hair, resembling, in colour and
texture, the coal black bristles of Bonthron.Thus, though famine had
begun the work, it would seem that Rothsay's death had been finally
accomplished by violence.The private stair to the dungeon, the keys of
which were found at the subaltern assassin's belt, the situation of the
vault, its communication with the external air by the fissure in the
walls, and the wretched lair of straw, with the fetters which remained
there, fully confirmed the story of Catharine and of the glee woman."We will not hesitate an instant," said the Douglas to his near kinsman,
the Lord Balveny, as soon as they returned from the dungeon."But, my lord, some trial may be fitting," answered Balveny."I have taken them red hand; my
authority will stretch to instant execution.Yet stay--have we not some
Jedwood men in our troop?""Plenty of Turnbulls, Rutherfords, Ainslies, and so forth," said
Balveny."Call me an inquest of these together; they are all good men and true,
saving a little shifting for their living.Do you see to the execution
of these felons, while I hold a court in the great hall, and we'll try
whether the jury or the provost marshal do their work first; we will
have Jedwood justice--hang in haste and try at leisure.""Yet stay, my lord," said Ramorny, "you may rue your haste--will you
grant me a word out of earshot?"said Douglas; "speak out what thou hast to say before
all that are here present.""Know all; then," said Ramorny, aloud, "that this noble Earl had letters
from the Duke of Albany and myself, sent him by the hand of yon cowardly
deserter, Buncle--let him deny it if he dare--counselling the removal
of the Duke for a space from court, and his seclusion in this Castle of
Falkland.""But not a word," replied Douglas, sternly smiling, "of his being flung
into a dungeon--famished--strangled.Away with the wretches, Balveny,
they pollute God's air too long!"The prisoners were dragged off to the battlements.But while the means
of execution were in the act of being prepared, the apothecary expressed
so ardent a desire to see Catharine once more, and, as he said, for
the good of his soul, that the maiden, in hopes his obduracy might have
undergone some change even at the last hour, consented again to go
to the battlements, and face a scene which her heart recoiled from.A single glance showed her Bonthron, sunk in total and drunken
insensibility; Ramorny, stripped of his armour, endeavouring in vain to
conceal fear, while he spoke with a priest, whose good offices he had
solicited; and Dwining, the same humble, obsequious looking, crouching
individual she had always known him.He held in his hand a little silver
pen, with which he had been writing on a scrap of parchment."Catharine," he said--"he, he, he!--I wish to speak to thee on the
nature of my religious faith.""If such be thy intention, why lose time with me?"The good father," said Dwining, "is--he, he!--already a worshipper of
the deity whom I have served.I therefore prefer to give the altar of
mine idol a new worshipper in thee, Catharine.This scrap of parchment
will tell thee how to make your way into my chapel, where I have
worshipped so often in safety.I leave the images which it contains to
thee as a legacy, simply because I hate and contemn thee something less
than any of the absurd wretches whom I have hitherto been obliged to
call fellow creatures.And now away--or remain and see if the end of the
quacksalver belies his life.""Nay," said the mediciner, "I have but a single word to say, and yonder
nobleman's valiancie may hear it if he will."Lord Balveny approached, with some curiosity; for the undaunted
resolution of a man who never wielded sword or bore armour and was in
person a poor dwindled dwarf, had to him an air of something resembling
sorcery.""You see this trifling implement," said the criminal, showing the
silver pen."By means of this I can escape the power even of the Black
Douglas.""Give him no ink nor paper," said Balveny, hastily, "he will draw a
spell.""Not so, please your wisdom and valiancie--he, he, he!"said Dwining
with his usual chuckle, as he unscrewed the top of the pen, within which
was a piece of sponge or some such substance, no bigger than a pea."Now, mark this--" said the prisoner, and drew it between his lips.He lay a dead corpse before them, the
contemptuous sneer still on his countenance.Catharine shrieked and fled, seeking, by a hasty descent, an escape from
a sight so appalling.Lord Balveny was for a moment stupified, and then
exclaimed, "This may be glamour!hang him over the battlements, quick
or dead.If his foul spirit hath only withdrawn for a space, it shall
return to a body with a dislocated neck."Ramorny and Bonthron were then ordered for
execution.The last was hanged before he seemed quite to comprehend what
was designed to be done with him.Ramorny, pale as death, yet with
the same spirit of pride which had occasioned his ruin, pleaded his
knighthood, and demanded the privilege of dying by decapitation by the
sword, and not by the noose."The Douglas never alters his doom," said Balveny."But thou shalt have
all thy rights.The menial whom he called appeared at his summons."What shakest thou for, fellow?"said Balveny; "here, strike me this
man's gilt spurs from his heels with thy cleaver.And now, John Ramorny,
thou art no longer a knight, but a knave.To the halter with him,
provost marshal!hang him betwixt his companions, and higher than them
if it may be."In a quarter of an hour afterwards, Balveny descended to tell the
Douglas that the criminals were executed."Then there is no further use in the trial," said the Earl."How say
you, good men of inquest, were these men guilty of high treason--ay or
no?""Guilty," exclaimed the obsequious inquest, with edifying unanimity, "we
need no farther evidence.""Sound trumpets, and to horse then, with our own train only; and let
each man keep silence on what has chanced here, until the proceedings
shall be laid before the King, which cannot conveniently be till the
battle of Palm Sunday shall be fought and ended.Select our attendants,
and tell each man who either goes with us or remains behind that he who
prates dies."In a few minutes the Douglas was on horseback, with the followers
selected to attend his person.Expresses were sent to his daughter, the
widowed Duchess of Rothsay, directing her to take her course to Perth,
by the shores of Lochleven, without approaching Falkland, and committing
to her charge Catharine Glover and the glee woman, as persons whose
safety he tendered.As they rode through the forest, they looked back, and beheld the three
bodies hanging, like specks darkening the walls of the old castle."The hand is punished," said Douglas, "but who shall arraign the head by
whose direction the act was done?""I do, kinsman; and were I to listen to the dictates of my heart, I
would charge him with the deed, which I am certain he has authorised.But there is no proof of it beyond strong suspicion, and Albany has
attached to himself the numerous friends of the house of Stuart, to
whom, indeed, the imbecility of the King and the ill regulated habits
of Rothsay left no other choice of a leader.Were I, therefore, to break
the bond which I have so lately formed with Albany, the consequence
must be civil war, an event ruinous to poor Scotland while threatened
by invasion from the activity of the Percy, backed by the treachery
of March.No, Balveny, the punishment of Albany must rest with Heaven,
which, in its own good time, will execute judgment on him and on his
house."The hour is nigh: now hearts beat high;
     Each sword is sharpen'd well;
     And who dares die, who stoops to fly,
     Tomorrow's light shall tell.We are now to recall to our reader's recollection, that Simon Glover and
his fair daughter had been hurried from their residence without having
time to announce to Henry Smith either their departure or the alarming
cause of it.When, therefore, the lover appeared in Curfew Street, on
the morning of their flight, instead of the hearty welcome of the honest
burgher, and the April reception, half joy half censure, which he had
been promised on the part of his lovely daughter, he received only the
astounding intelligence, that her father and she had set off early, on
the summons of a stranger, who had kept himself carefully muffled from
observation.To this, Dorothy, whose talents for forestalling evil, and
communicating her views of it, are known to the reader, chose to add,
that she had no doubt her master and young mistress were bound for the
Highlands, to avoid a visit which had been made since their departure by
two or three apparitors, who, in the name of a Commission appointed by
the King, had searched the house, put seals upon such places as were
supposed to contain papers, and left citations for father and daughter
to appear before the Court of Commission, on a day certain, under pain
of outlawry.All these alarming particulars Dorothy took care to state
in the gloomiest colours, and the only consolation which she afforded
the alarmed lover was, that her master had charged her to tell him to
reside quietly at Perth, and that he should soon hear news of them.This
checked the smith's first resolve, which was to follow them instantly to
the Highlands, and partake the fate which they might encounter.But when he recollected his repeated feuds with divers of the Clan
Quhele, and particularly his personal quarrel with Conachar, who was now
raised to be a high chief, he could not but think, on reflection, that
his intrusion on their place of retirement was more likely to disturb
the safety which they might otherwise enjoy there than be of any service
to them.He was well acquainted with Simon's habitual intimacy with
the chief of the Clan Quhele, and justly augured that the glover would
obtain protection, which his own arrival might be likely to disturb,
while his personal prowess could little avail him in a quarrel with
a whole tribe of vindictive mountaineers.At the same time his heart
throbbed with indignation, when he thought of Catharine being within the
absolute power of young Conachar, whose rivalry he could not doubt, and
who had now so many means of urging his suit.What if the young chief
should make the safety of the father depend on the favour of the
daughter?He distrusted not Catharine's affections, but then her mode
of thinking was so disinterested, and her attachment to her father so
tender, that, if the love she bore her suitor was weighed against his
security, or perhaps his life, it was matter of deep and awful doubt
whether it might not be found light in the balance.Tormented by
thoughts on which we need not dwell, he resolved nevertheless to
remain at home, stifle his anxiety as he might, and await the promised
intelligence from the old man.It came, but it did not relieve his
concern.Sir Patrick Charteris had not forgotten his promise to communicate to
the smith the plans of the fugitives.But, amid the bustle occasioned by
the movement of troops, he could not himself convey the intelligence.He therefore entrusted to his agent, Kitt Henshaw, the task of making it
known.But this worthy person, as the reader knows, was in the interest
of Ramorny, whose business it was to conceal from every one, but
especially from a lover so active and daring as Henry, the real place of
Catharine's residence.Henshaw therefore announced to the anxious smith
that his friend the glover was secure in the Highlands; and though he
affected to be more reserved on the subject of Catharine, he said little
to contradict the belief that she as well as Simon shared the protection
of the Clan Quhele.But he reiterated, in the name of Sir Patrick,
assurances that father and daughter were both well, and that Henry would
best consult his own interest and their safety by remaining quiet and
waiting the course of events.With an agonized heart, therefore, Henry Gow determined to remain quiet
till he had more certain intelligence, and employed himself in finishing
a shirt of mail, which he intended should be the best tempered and the
most finely polished that his skilful hands had ever executed.This
exercise of his craft pleased him better than any other occupation which
he could have adopted, and served as an apology for secluding himself
in his workshop, and shunning society, where the idle reports which were
daily circulated served only to perplex and disturb him.He resolved to
trust in the warm regard of Simon, the faith of his daughter, and the
friendship of the provost, who, having so highly commended his valour
in the combat with Bonthron, would never, he thought, desert him at this
extremity of his fortunes.Time, however, passed on day by day; and
it was not till Palm Sunday was near approaching, that Sir Patrick
Charteris, having entered the city to make some arrangements for the
ensuing combat, bethought himself of making a visit to the Smith of the
Wynd.He entered his workshop with an air of sympathy unusual to him, and
which made Henry instantly augur that he brought bad news.The smith
caught the alarm, and the uplifted hammer was arrested in its descent
upon the heated iron, while the agitated arm that wielded it, strong
before as that of a giant, became so powerless, that it was with
difficulty Henry was able to place the weapon on the ground, instead of
dropping it from his hand."My poor Henry," said Sir Patrick, "I bring you but cold news; they are
uncertain, however, and, if true, they are such as a brave man like you
should not take too deeply to heart.""In God's name, my lord," said Henry, "I trust you bring no evil news of
Simon Glover or his daughter?""Touching themselves," said Sir Patrick, "no: they are safe and well.But as to thee, Henry, my tidings are more cold.Kitt Henshaw has, I
think, apprised thee that I had endeavoured to provide Catharine Glover
with a safe protection in the house of an honourable lady, the Duchess
of Rothsay.But she hath declined the charge, and Catharine hath been
sent to her father in the Highlands.Thou
mayest have heard that Gilchrist MacIan is dead, and that his son
Eachin, who was known in Perth as the apprentice of old Simon, by the
name of Conachar, is now the chief of Clan Quhele; and I heard from one
of my domestics that there is a strong rumour among the MacIans that the
young chief seeks the hand of Catharine in marriage.My domestic learned
this--as a secret, however--while in the Breadalbane country, on some
arrangements touching the ensuing combat.The thing is uncertain but,
Henry, it wears a face of likelihood.""Did your lordship's servant see Simon Glover and his daughter?"said
Henry, struggling for breath, and coughing, to conceal from the provost
the excess of his agitation."He did not," said Sir Patrick; "the Highlanders seemed jealous, and
refused to permit him to speak to the old man, and he feared to alarm
them by asking to see Catharine.Besides, he talks no Gaelic, nor had
his informer much English, so there may be some mistake in the matter.Nevertheless, there is such a report, and I thought it best to tell it
you.But you may be well assured that the wedding cannot go on till the
affair of Palm Sunday be over; and I advise you to take no step till we
learn the circumstances of the matter, for certainty is most desirable,
even when it is painful.Go you to the council house," he added, after a
pause, "to speak about the preparations for the lists in the North Inch?"Well, Smith, I judge by your brief answer that you are discomposed with
this matter; but, after all, women are weathercocks, that is the truth
on't.Solomon and others have proved it before you."And so Sir Patrick Charteris retired, fully convinced he had discharged
the office of a comforter in the most satisfactory manner.With very different impressions did the unfortunate lover regard the
tidings and listen to the consoling commentary."The provost," he said bitterly to himself, "is an excellent man; marry,
he holds his knighthood so high, that, if he speaks nonsense, a poor man
must hold it sense, as he must praise dead ale if it be handed to him
in his lordship's silver flagon.How would all this sound in another
situation?Suppose I were rolling down the steep descent of the
Corrichie Dhu, and before I came to the edge of the rock, comes my Lord
Provost, and cries: 'Henry, there is a deep precipice, and I grieve to
say you are in the fair way of rolling over it.But be not downcast,
for Heaven may send a stone or a bush to stop your progress.However, I
thought it would be comfort to you to know the worst, which you will
be presently aware of.I do not know how many hundred feet deep the
precipice descends, but you may form a judgment when you are at the
bottom, for certainty is certainty.when come you to take
a game at bowls?'And this gossip is to serve instead of any friendly
attempt to save the poor wight's neck!When I think of this, I could go
mad, seize my hammer, and break and destroy all around me.But I will
be calm; and if this Highland kite, who calls himself a falcon, should
stoop at my turtle dove, he shall know whether a burgess of Perth can
draw a bow or not."It was now the Thursday before the fated Palm Sunday, and the champions
on either side were expected to arrive the next day, that they might
have the interval of Saturday to rest, refresh themselves, and prepare
for the combat.Two or three of each of the contending parties were
detached to receive directions about the encampment of their little
band, and such other instructions as might be necessary to the proper
ordering of the field.Henry was not, therefore, surprised at seeing a
tall and powerful Highlander peering anxiously about the wynd in which
he lived, in the manner in which the natives of a wild country examine
the curiosities of one that is more civilized.The smith's heart rose
against the man on account of his country, to which our Perth burgher
bore a natural prejudice, and more especially as he observed the
individual wear the plaid peculiar to the Clan Quhele.The sprig of oak
leaves, worked in silk, intimated also that the individual was one
of those personal guards of young Eachin, upon whose exertions in the
future battle so much reliance was placed by those of their clan.Having observed so much, Henry withdrew into his smithy, for the sight
of the man raised his passion; and, knowing that the Highlander came
plighted to a solemn combat, and could not be the subject of any
inferior quarrel, he was resolved at least to avoid friendly intercourse
with him.In a few minutes, however, the door of the smithy flew open,
and flattering in his tartans, which greatly magnified his actual size,
the Gael entered with the haughty step of a man conscious of a personal
dignity superior to anything which he is likely to meet with.He stood
looking around him, and seemed to expect to be received with courtesy
and regarded with wonder.But Henry had no sort of inclination to
indulge his vanity and kept hammering away at a breastplate which was
lying upon his anvil as if he were not aware of his visitor's presence.(the bandy legged smith), said the Highlander."Those that wish to be crook backed call me so," answered Henry."No offence meant," said the Highlander; "but her own self comes to buy
an armour.""Her own self's bare shanks may trot hence with her," answered Henry; "I
have none to sell.""If it was not within two days of Palm Sunday, herself would make you
sing another song," retorted the Gael."And being the day it is," said Henry, with the same contemptuous
indifference, "I pray you to stand out of my light.""You are an uncivil person; but her own self is fir nan ord too; and she
knows the smith is fiery when the iron is hot.""If her nainsell be hammer man herself, her nainsell may make her nain
harness," replied Henry."And so her nainsell would, and never fash you for the matter; but it
is said, Gow Chrom, that you sing and whistle tunes over the swords and
harnishes that you work, that have power to make the blades cut steel
links as if they were paper, and the plate and mail turn back steel
lances as if they were boddle prins?""They tell your ignorance any nonsense that Christian men refuse to
believe," said Henry."I whistle at my work whatever comes uppermost,
like an honest craftsman, and commonly it is the Highlandman's 'Och hone
for Houghman stares!'"Friend, it is but idle to spur a horse when his legs are ham shackled,"
said the Highlander, haughtily."Her own self cannot fight even now, and
there is little gallantry in taunting her thus.""By nails and hammer, you are right there," said the smith, altering his
tone."But speak out at once, friend, what is it thou wouldst have of
me?I am in no humour for dallying.""A hauberk for her chief, Eachin MacIan," said the Highlander."You are a hammer man, you say?said our
smith, producing from a chest the mail shirt on which he had been lately
employed.The Gael handled it with a degree of admiration which had something of
envy in it.He looked curiously at every part of its texture, and at
length declared it the very best piece of armour that he had ever seen."A hundred cows and bullocks and a good drift of sheep would be e'en
ower cheap an offer," said the Highlandman, by way of tentative; "but
her nainsell will never bid thee less, come by them how she can.""It is a fair proffer," replied Henry; "but gold nor gear will never buy
that harness.I want to try my own sword on my own armour, and I will
not give that mail coat to any one but who will face me for the best of
three blows and a thrust in the fair field; and it is your chief's upon
these terms.""Hut, prut, man--take a drink and go to bed," said the Highlander, in
great scorn.Think ye the captain of the Clan Quhele will
be brawling and battling with a bit Perth burgess body like you?Whisht,
man, and hearken.Her nainsell will do ye mair credit than ever belonged
to your kin.She will fight you for the fair harness hersell.""She must first show that she is my match," said Henry, with a grim
smile.I, one of Eachin MacIan's leichtach, and not your match!""You may try me, if you will.Do you know
how to cast a sledge hammer?""Ay, truly--ask the eagle if he can fly over Farragon.""But before you strive with me, you must first try a cast with one of my
leichtach.Here, Dunter, stand forth for the honour of Perth!And now,
Highlandman, there stands a row of hammers; choose which you will, and
let us to the garden."The Highlander whose name was Norman nan Ord, or Norman of the Hammer,
showed his title to the epithet by selecting the largest hammer of the
set, at which Henry smiled.Dunter, the stout journeyman of the smith,
made what was called a prodigious cast; but the Highlander, making a
desperate effort, threw beyond it by two or three feet, and looked with
an air of triumph to Henry, who again smiled in reply.said the Gael, offering our smith the hammer."Not with that child's toy," said Henry, "which has scarce weight to
fly against the wind.Jannekin, fetch me Sampson; or one of you help the
boy, for Sampson is somewhat ponderous."The hammer now produced was half as heavy again as that which the
Highlander had selected as one of unusual weight.Norman stood
astonished; but he was still more so when Henry, taking his position,
swung the ponderous implement far behind his right haunch joint, and
dismissed it from his hand as if it had flown from a warlike engine.The
air groaned and whistled as the mass flew through it.Down at length it
came, and the iron head sunk a foot into the earth, a full yard beyond
the cast of Norman.The Highlander, defeated and mortified, went to the spot where the
weapon lay, lifted it, poised it in his hand with great wonder, and
examined it closely, as if he expected to discover more in it than a
common hammer.He at length returned it to the owner with a melancholy
smile, shrugging his shoulders and shaking his head as the smith asked
him whether he would not mend his cast."Norman has lost too much at the sport already," he replied."She has
lost her own name of the Hammerer.But does her own self, the Gow Chrom,
work at the anvil with that horse's load of iron?""You shall see, brother," said Henry, leading the way to the smithy."Dunter," he said, "rax me that bar from the furnace"; and uplifting
Sampson, as he called the monstrous hammer, he plied the metal with a
hundred strokes from right to left--now with the right hand, now with
the left, now with both, with so much strength at once and dexterity,
that he worked off a small but beautifully proportioned horseshoe in
half the time that an ordinary smith would have taken for the same
purpose, using a more manageable implement.said the Highlander, "and what for would you be fighting
with our young chief, who is far above your standard, though you were
the best smith ever wrought with wind and fire?"said Henry; "you seem a good fellow, and I'll tell you the
truth.Your master has wronged me, and I give him this harness freely
for the chance of fighting him myself.""Nay, if he hath wronged you he must meet you," said the life guardsman."To do a man wrong takes the eagle's feather out of the chief's bonnet;
and were he the first in the Highlands, and to be sure so is Eachin,
he must fight the man he has wronged, or else a rose falls from his
chaplet.""Will you move him to this," said Henry, "after the fight on Sunday?""Oh, her nainsell will do her best, if the hawks have not got her
nainsell's bones to pick; for you must know, brother, that Clan
Chattan's claws pierce rather deep.""The armour is your chief's on that condition," said Henry; "but I will
disgrace him before king and court if he does not pay me the price.""Deil a fear--deil a fear; I will bring him in to the barrace myself,"
said Norman, "assuredly.""You will do me a pleasure," replied Henry; "and that you may remember
your promise, I will bestow on you this dirk.Look--if you hold it
truly, and can strike between the mail hood and the collar of your
enemy, the surgeon will be needless."The Highlander was lavish in his expressions of gratitude, and took his
leave."I have given him the best mail harness I ever wrought," said the smith
to himself, rather repenting his liberality, "for the poor chance
that he will bring his chief into a fair field with me; and then let
Catharine be his who can win her fairly.But much I dread the youth will
find some evasion, unless he have such luck on Palm Sunday as may induce
him to try another combat.That is some hope, however; for I have often,
ere now, seen a raw young fellow shoot up after his first fight from a
dwarf into a giant queller."Thus, with little hope, but with the most determined resolution, Henry
Smith awaited the time that should decide his fate.What made him augur
the worst was the silence both of the glover and of his daughter."They are ashamed," he said, "to confess the truth to me, and therefore
they are silent."Upon the Friday at noon, the two bands of thirty men each, representing
the contending clans, arrived at the several points where they were to
halt for refreshments.The Clan Quhele was entertained hospitably at the rich abbey of Scone,
while the provost regaled their rivals at his Castle of Kinfauns, the
utmost care being taken to treat both parties with the most punctilious
attention, and to afford neither an opportunity of complaining of
partiality.All points of etiquette were, in the mean while, discussed
and settled by the Lord High Constable Errol and the young Earl of
Crawford, the former acting on the part of the Clan Chattan and the
latter patronising the Clan Quhele.Messengers were passing continually
from the one earl to the other, and they held more than: six meetings
within thirty hours, before the ceremonial of the field could be exactly
arranged.Meanwhile, in case of revival of ancient quarrel, many seeds of
which existed betwixt the burghers and their mountain neighbours, a
proclamation commanded the citizens not to approach within half a mile
of the place where the Highlanders were quartered; while on their part
the intended combatants were prohibited from approaching Perth without
special license.Troops were stationed to enforce this order, who did
their charge so scrupulously as to prevent Simon Glover himself, burgess
and citizen of Perth, from approaching the town, because he owned having
come thither at the same time with the champions of Eachin MacIan, and
wore a plaid around him of their check or pattern.This interruption
prevented Simon from seeking out Henry Wynd and possessing him with a
true knowledge of all that had happened since their separation, which
intercourse, had it taken place, must have materially altered the
catastrophe of our narrative.On Saturday afternoon another arrival took place, which interested the
city almost as much as the preparations for the expected combat.This
was the approach of the Earl Douglas, who rode through the town with a
troop of only thirty horse, but all of whom were knights and gentlemen
of the first consequence.Men's eyes followed this dreaded peer as they
pursue the flight of an eagle through the clouds, unable to ken the
course of the bird of Jove yet silent, attentive, and as earnest in
observing him as if they could guess the object for which he sweeps
through the firmament; He rode slowly through the city, and passed out
at the northern gate.He next alighted at the Dominican convent and
desired to see the Duke of Albany.The Earl was introduced instantly,
and received by the Duke with a manner which was meant to be graceful
and conciliatory, but which could not conceal both art and inquietude.When the first greetings were over, the Earl said with great gravity:
"I bring you melancholy news.Your Grace's royal nephew, the Duke of
Rothsay, is no more, and I fear hath perished by some foul practices."said the Duke' in confusion--"what practices?Who dared
practise on the heir of the Scottish throne?""'Tis not for me to state how these doubts arise," said Douglas; "but
men say the eagle was killed with an arrow fledged from his own wing,
and the oak trunk rent by a wedge of the same wood.""Earl of Douglas," said the Duke of Albany, "I am no reader of riddles.""Nor am I a propounder of them," said Douglas, haughtily, "Your Grace
will find particulars in these papers worthy of perusal.I will go for
half an hour to the cloister garden, and then rejoin you.""You go not to the King, my lord?""No," answered Douglas; "I trust your Grace will agree with me that we
should conceal this great family misfortune from our sovereign till the
business of tomorrow be decided.""If the King heard of this loss, he
could not witness the combat; and if he appear not in person, these men
are likely to refuse to fight, and the whole work is cast loose.But
I pray you sit down, my lord, while I read these melancholy papers
respecting poor Rothsay."He passed the papers through his hands, turning some over with a hasty
glance, and dwelling on others as if their contents had been of the
last importance.When he had spent nearly a quarter of an hour in this
manner, he raised his eyes, and said very gravely: "My lord, in these
most melancholy documents, it is yet a comfort to see nothing which can
renew the divisions in the King's councils, which were settled by the
last solemn agreement between your lordship and myself.My unhappy
nephew was by that agreement to be set aside, until time should send him
a graver judgment.He is now removed by Fate, and our purpose in that
matter is anticipated and rendered unnecessary.""If your Grace," replied the Earl, "sees nothing to disturb the good
understanding which the tranquillity and safety of Scotland require
should exist between us, I am not so ill a friend of my country as to
look closely for such.""I understand you, my Lord of Douglas," said Albany, eagerly."You
hastily judged that I should be offended with your lordship for
exercising your powers of lieutenancy, and punishing the detestable
murderers within my territory of Falkland.Credit me, on the contrary, I
am obliged to your lordship for taking out of my hands the punishment of
these wretches, as it would have broken my heart even to have looked
on them.The Scottish Parliament will inquire, doubtless, into this
sacrilegious deed; and happy am I that the avenging sword has been
in the hand of a man so important as your lordship.Our communication
together, as your lordship must well recollect, bore only concerning a
proposed restraint of my unfortunate nephew until the advance of a year
or two had taught him discretion?""Such was certainly your Grace's purpose, as expressed to me," said the
Earl; "I can safely avouch it.""Why, then, noble earl, we cannot be censured because villains, for
their own revengeful ends, appear to have engrafted a bloody termination
on our honest purpose?""The Parliament will judge it after their wisdom," said Douglas."For my
part, my conscience acquits me.""And mine assoilzies me," said the Duke with solemnity."Now, my lord,
touching the custody of the boy James, who succeeds to his father's
claims of inheritance?""The King must decide it," said Douglas, impatient of the conference."I will consent to his residence anywhere save at Stirling, Doune, or
Falkland.""He is gone," muttered the crafty Albany, "and he must be my ally, yet
feels himself disposed to be my mortal foe.No matter, Rothsay sleeps
with his fathers, James may follow in time, and then--a crown is the
recompense of my perplexities."Thretty for thretty faucht in barreris,
     At Sanct Johnstoun on a day besyde the black freris.At an earlier period of the Christian Church,
the use of any of the days of Passion Week for the purpose of combat
would have been accounted a profanity worthy of excommunication.The
Church of Rome, to her infinite honour, had decided that during the holy
season of Easter, when the redemption of man from his fallen state was
accomplished, the sword of war should be sheathed, and angry monarchs
should respect the season termed the Truce of God.The ferocious
violence of the latter wars betwixt Scotland and England had destroyed
all observance of this decent and religious Ordinance.Very often the
most solemn occasions were chosen by one party for an attack, because
they hoped to find the other engaged in religious duties and unprovided
for defence.Thus the truce, once considered as proper to the season,
had been discontinued; and it became not unusual even to select the
sacred festivals of the church for decision of the trial by combat, to
which this intended contest bore a considerable resemblance.On the present occasion, however, the duties of the day were observed
with the usual solemnity, and the combatants themselves took share in
them.Bearing branches of yew in their hands, as the readiest substitute
for palm boughs, they marched respectively to the Dominican and
Carthusian convents, to hear High Mass, and, by a show at least of
devotion, to prepare themselves for the bloody strife of the day.Great
care had of course been taken that, during this march, they should not
even come within the sound of each other's bagpipes; for it was certain
that, like game cocks exchanging mutual notes of defiance, they would
have sought out and attacked each other before they arrived at the place
of combat.The citizens of Perth crowded to see the unusual procession on the
streets, and thronged the churches where the two clans attended their
devotions, to witness their behaviour, and to form a judgment from
their appearance which was most likely to obtain the advantage in
the approaching conflict.Their demeanour in the church, although not
habitual frequenters of places of devotion, was perfectly decorous; and,
notwithstanding their wild and untamed dispositions, there were few of
the mountaineers who seemed affected either with curiosity or wonder.They appeared to think it beneath their dignity of character to testify
either curiosity or surprise at many things which were probably then
presented to them for the first time.On the issue of the combat, few even of the most competent judges dared
venture a prediction; although the great size of Torquil and his eight
stalwart sons induced some who professed themselves judges of the thewes
and sinews of men to incline to ascribe the advantage to the party of
the Clan Quhele.The opinion of the female sex was much decided by
the handsome form, noble countenance, and gallant demeanour of Eachin
MacIan.There were more than one who imagined they had recollection
of his features, but his splendid military attire rendered the humble
glover's apprentice unrecognisable in the young Highland chief, saving
by one person.That person, as may well be supposed, was the Smith of the Wynd, who
had been the foremost in the crowd that thronged to see the gallant
champions of Clan Quhele.It was with mingled feelings of dislike,
jealousy, and something approaching to admiration that he saw the
glover's apprentice stripped of his mean slough, and blazing forth as a
chieftain, who, by his quick eye and gallant demeanour, the noble shape
of his brow and throat, his splendid arms and well proportioned limbs,
seemed well worthy to hold the foremost rank among men selected to live
or die for the honour of their race.The smith could hardly think that
he looked upon the same passionate boy whom he had brushed off as
he might a wasp that stung him, and, in mere compassion, forebore to
despatch by treading on him."He looks it gallantly with my noble hauberk," thus muttered Henry to
himself, "the best I ever wrought.Yet, if he and I stood together where
there was neither hand to help nor eye to see, by all that is blessed in
this holy church, the good harness should return to its owner!All that
I am worth would I give for three fair blows on his shoulders to undo my
own best work; but such happiness will never be mine.If he escape from
the conflict, it will be with so high a character for courage, that he
may well disdain to put his fortune, in its freshness, to the risk of
an encounter with a poor burgess like myself.He will fight by his
champion, and turn me over to my fellow craftsman the hammerer, when all
I can reap will be the pleasure of knocking a Highland bullock on the
head.I will to the other church in
quest of him, since for sure he must have come down from the Highlands."The congregation was moving from the church of the Dominicans when the
smith formed this determination, which he endeavoured to carry into
speedy execution, by thrusting through the crowd as hastily as the
solemnity of the place and occasion would permit.In making his way
through the press, he was at one instant carried so close to Eachin
that their eyes encountered.The smith's hardy and embrowned countenance
 up like the heated iron on which he wrought, and retained
its dark red hue for several minutes.Eachin's features glowed with a
brighter blush of indignation, and a glance of fiery hatred was shot
from his eyes.But the sudden flush died away in ashy paleness, and his
gaze instantly avoided the unfriendly but steady look with which it was
encountered.Torquil, whose eye never quitted his foster son, saw his emotion, and
looked anxiously around to discover the cause.But Henry was already
at a distance, and hastening on his way to the Carthusian convent.Here
also the religious service of the day was ended; and those who had so
lately borne palms in honour of the great event which brought peace
on earth and goodwill to the children of men were now streaming to
the place of combat--some prepared to take the lives of their fellow
creatures or to lose their own, others to view the deadly strife with
the savage delight which the heathens took in the contests of their
gladiators.The crowd was so great that any other person might well have despaired
of making way through it.But the general deference entertained for
Henry of the Wynd, as the champion of Perth, and the universal sense of
his ability to force a passage, induced all to unite in yielding room
for him, so that he was presently quite close to the warriors of the
Clan Chattan.Their pipers marched at the head of their column.Next
followed the well known banner, displaying a mountain cat rampant, with
the appropriate caution, "Touch not the cat, but (i.e.The chief followed with his two handed sword advanced, as if to
protect the emblem of the tribe.He was a man of middle stature, more
than fifty years old, but betraying neither in features nor form any
decay of strength or symptoms of age.His dark red close curled locks
were in part chequered by a few grizzled hairs, but his step and gesture
were as light in the dance, in the chase, or in the battle as if he had
not passed his thirtieth year.His grey eye gleamed with a wild light
expressive of valour and ferocity mingled; but wisdom and experience
dwelt on the expression of his forehead, eyebrows, and lips.The chosen
champions followed by two and two.There was a cast of anxiety on
several of their faces, for they had that morning discovered the absence
of one of their appointed number; and, in a contest so desperate as was
expected, the loss seemed a matter of importance to all save to their
high mettled chief, MacGillie Chattanach."Say nothing to the Saxons of his absence," said this bold leader, when
the diminution of his force was reported to him."The false Lowland
tongues might say that one of Clan Chattan was a coward, and perhaps
that the rest favoured his escape, in order to have a pretence to avoid
the battle.I am sure that Ferquhard Day will be found in the ranks ere
we are ready for battle; or, if he should not, am not I man enough for
two of the Clan Quhele?or would we not fight them fifteen to thirty,
rather than lose the renown that this day will bring us?"The tribe received the brave speech of their leader with applause, yet
there were anxious looks thrown out in hopes of espying the return of
the deserter; and perhaps the chief himself was the only one of the
determined band who was totally indifferent on the subject.They marched on through the streets without seeing anything of Ferquhard
Day, who, many a mile beyond the mountains, was busied in receiving such
indemnification as successful love could bestow for the loss of honour.MacGillie Chattanach marched on without seeming to observe the absence
of the deserter, and entered upon the North Inch, a beautiful and level
plain, closely adjacent to the city, and appropriated to the martial
exercises of the inhabitants.The plain is washed on one side by the deep and swelling Tay.There was
erected within it a strong palisade, inclosing on three sides a space of
one hundred and fifty yards in length and seventy-four yards in width.The fourth side of the lists was considered as sufficiently fenced
by the river.An amphitheatre for the accommodation of spectators
surrounded the palisade, leaving a large space free to be occupied by
armed men on foot and horseback, and for the more ordinary class of
spectators.At the extremity of the lists which was nearest to the city,
there was a range of elevated galleries for the King and his courtiers,
so highly decorated with rustic treillage, intermingled with gilded
ornaments, that the spot retains to this day the name of the Golden, or
Gilded, Arbour.The mountain minstrelsy, which sounded the appropriate pibrochs or
battle tunes of the rival confederacies, was silent when they entered on
the Inch, for such was the order which had been given.Two stately but
aged warriors, each bearing the banner of his tribe, advanced to the
opposite extremities of the lists, and, pitching their standards into
the earth, prepared to be spectators of a fight in which they were not
to join.The pipers, who were also to be neutral in the strife, took
their places by their respective brattachs.The multitude received both bands with the same general shout with which
on similar occasions they welcome those from whose exertion they expect
amusement, or what they term sport.The destined combatants returned
no answer to this greeting, but each party advanced to the opposite
extremities of the lists, where were entrances by which they were to be
admitted to the interior.A strong body of men at arms guarded either
access; and the Earl Marshal at the one and the Lord High Constable at
the other carefully examined each individual, to see whether he had the
appropriate arms, being steel cap, mail shirt, two handed sword, and
dagger.They also examined the numbers of each party; and great was the
alarm among the multitude when the Earl of Errol held up his hand and
cried: "Ho!The combat cannot proceed, for the Clan Chattan lack one of
their number."said the young Earl of Crawford; "they should have
counted better ere they left home."The Earl Marshal, however, agreed with the Constable that the fight
could not proceed until the inequality should be removed; and a general
apprehension was excited in the assembled multitude that, after all the
preparation, there would be no battle.Of all present there were only two perhaps who rejoiced at the prospect
of the combat being adjourned, and these were the captain of the Clan
Quhele and the tender hearted King Robert.Meanwhile the two chiefs,
each attended by a special friend and adviser, met in the midst of the
lists, having, to assist them in determining what was to be done, the
Earl Marshal, the Lord High Constable, the Earl of Crawford, and Sir
Patrick Charteris.The chief of the Clan Chattan declared himself
willing and desirous of fighting upon the spot, without regard to the
disparity of numbers."That," said Torquil of the Oak, "Clan Quhele will never consent to.You can never win honour from us with the sword, and you seek but a
subterfuge, that you may say when you are defeated, as you know you will
be, that it was for want of the number of your band fully counted out.But I make a proposal: Ferquhard Day was the youngest of your band,
Eachin MacIan is the youngest of ours; we will set him aside in place of
the man who has fled from the combat.""A most unjust and unequal proposal," exclaimed Toshach Beg, the second,
as he might be termed, of MacGillie Chattanach."The life of the chief
is to the clan the breath of our nostrils, nor will we ever consent that
our chief shall be exposed to dangers which the captain of Clan Quhele
does not share."Torquil saw with deep anxiety that his plan was about to fail when the
objection was made to Hector's being withdrawn from the battle, and
he was meditating how to support his proposal, when Eachin himself
interfered.His timidity, it must be observed, was not of that sordid
and selfish nature which induces those who are infected by it calmly
to submit to dishonour rather than risk danger.On the contrary, he was
morally brave, though constitutionally timid, and the shame of avoiding
the combat became at the moment more powerful than the fear of facing
it."I will not hear," he said, "of a scheme which will leave my sword
sheathed during this day's glorious combat.If I am young in arms, there
are enough of brave men around me whom I may imitate if I cannot equal."He spoke these words in a spirit which imposed on Torquil, and perhaps
on the young chief himself."I was sure the foul spell would be broken through, and that the tardy
spirit which besieged him would fly at the sound of the pipe and the
first flutter of the brattach!""Hear me, Lord Marshal," said the Constable."The hour of combat may not
be much longer postponed, for the day approaches to high noon.Let the
chief of Clan Chattan take the half hour which remains, to find, if he
can, a substitute for this deserter; if he cannot, let them fight as
they stand.""Content I am," said the Marshal, "though, as none of his own clan are
nearer than fifty miles, I see not how MacGillis Chattanach is to find
an auxiliary.""That is his business," said the High Constable; "but, if he offers a
high reward, there are enough of stout yeomen surrounding the lists,
who will be glad enough to stretch their limbs in such a game as is
expected.I myself, did my quality and charge permit, would blythely
take a turn of work amongst these wild fellows, and think it fame won."They communicated their decision to the Highlanders, and the chief of
the Clan Chattan replied: "You have judged unpartially and nobly, my
lords, and I deem myself obliged to follow your direction.So make
proclamation, heralds, that, if any one will take his share with Clan
Chattan of the honours and chances of this day, he shall have present
payment of a gold crown, and liberty to fight to the death in my ranks.""You are something chary of your treasure, chief," said the Earl
Marshal: "a gold crown is poor payment for such a campaign as is before
you.""If there be any man willing to fight for honour," replied MacGillis
Chattanach, "the price will be enough; and I want not the service of a
fellow who draws his sword for gold alone."The heralds had made their progress, moving half way round the lists,
stopping from time to time to make proclamation as they had been
directed, without the least apparent disposition on the part of any one
to accept of the proffered enlistment.Some sneered at the poverty of
the Highlanders, who set so mean a price upon such a desperate service.Others affected resentment, that they should esteem the blood of
citizens so lightly.None showed the slightest intention to undertake
the task proposed, until the sound of the proclamation reached Henry of
the Wynd, as he stood without the barrier, speaking from time to time
with Baillie Craigdallie, or rather listening vaguely to what the
magistrate was saying to him."A liberal offer on the part of MacGillie Chattanach," said the host of
the Griffin, "who proposes a gold crown to any one who will turn wildcat
for the day, and be killed a little in his service!exclaimed the smith, eagerly, "do they make proclamation for a
man to fight against the Clan Quhele?""Ay, marry do they," said Griffin; "but I think they will find no such
fools in Perth."He had hardly said the word, when he beheld the smith clear the barriers
at a single bound and alight in the lists, saying: "Here am I, sir
herald, Henry of the Wynd, willing to battle on the part of the Clan
Chattan."A cry of admiration ran through the multitude, while the grave burghers,
not being able to conceive the slightest reason for Henry's behaviour,
concluded that his head must be absolutely turned with the love of
fighting."Thou art mad," he said, "Henry!Thou hast neither two handed sword nor
shirt of mail.""Truly no," said Henry, "for I parted with a mail shirt, which I had
made for myself, to yonder gay chief of the Clan Quhele, who will soon
find on his shoulders with what sort of blows I clink my rivets!As for
two handed sword, why, this boy's brand will serve my turn till I can
master a heavier one.""This must not be," said Errol."Hark thee, armourer, by St.Mary, thou
shalt have my Milan hauberk and good Spanish sword.""I thank your noble earlship, Sir Gilbert Hay, but the yoke with which
your brave ancestor turned the battle at Loncarty would serve my turn
well enough.I am little used to sword or harness that I have not
wrought myself, because I do not well know what blows the one will bear
out without being cracked or the other lay on without snapping."The cry had in the mean while run through the multitude and passed into
the town, that the dauntless smith was about to fight without armour,
when, just as the fated hour was approaching, the shrill voice of a
female was heard screaming for passage through the crowd.The multitude
gave place to her importunity, and she advanced, breathless with haste
under the burden of a mail hauberk and a large two handed sword.The
widow of Oliver Proudfute was soon recognised, and the arms which she
bore were those of the smith himself, which, occupied by her husband on
the fatal evening when he was murdered, had been naturally conveyed
to his house with the dead body, and were now, by the exertions of
his grateful widow, brought to the lists at a moment when such proved
weapons were of the last consequence to their owner.Henry joyfully
received the well known arms, and the widow with trembling haste
assisted in putting them on, and then took leave of him, saying: "God
for the champion of the widow and orphan, and ill luck to all who come
before him!"Confident at feeling himself in his well proved armour, Henry shook
himself as if to settle the steel shirt around him, and, unsheathing
the two handed sword, made it flourish over his head, cutting the air
through which it whistled in the form of the figure eight with an ease
and sleight of hand that proved how powerfully and skilfully he could
wield the ponderous weapon.The champions were now ordered to march
in their turns around the lists, crossing so as to avoid meeting each
other, and making obeisance as they passed the Golden Arbour where the
King was seated.While this course was performing, most of the spectators were again
curiously comparing the stature, limbs, and sinews of the two parties,
and endeavouring to form a conjecture an to the probable issue of the
combat.The feud of a hundred years, with all its acts of aggression
and retaliation, was concentrated in the bosom of each combatant.Their
countenances seemed fiercely writhen into the wildest expression of
pride, hate, and a desperate purpose of fighting to the very last.The spectators murmured a joyful applause, in high wrought expectation
of the bloody game.Wagers were offered and accepted both on the general
issue of the conflict and on the feats of particular champions.The
clear, frank, and elated look of Henry Smith rendered him a general
favourite among the spectators, and odds, to use the modern expression,
were taken that he would kill three of his opponents before he himself
fell.Scarcely was the smith equipped for the combat, when the commands of the
chiefs ordered the champions into their places; and at the same moment
Henry heard the voice of Simon Glover issuing from the crowd, who were
now silent with expectation, and calling on him: "Harry Smith--Harry
Smith, what madness hath possessed thee?""Ay, he wishes to save his hopeful son in law that is, or is to be, from
the smith's handling," was Henry's first thought; his second was to turn
and speak with him; and his third, that he could on no pretext desert
the band which he had joined, or even seem desirous to delay the fight,
consistently with honour.He turned himself, therefore, to the business of the hour.Both parties
were disposed by the respective chiefs in three lines, each containing
ten men.They were arranged with such intervals between each individual
as offered him scope to wield his sword, the blade of which was five
feet long, not including the handle.The second and third lines were
to come up as reserves, in case the first experienced disaster.On the
right of the array of Clan Quhele, the chief, Eachin MacIan, placed
himself in the second line betwixt two of his foster brothers.Four of
them occupied the right of the first line, whilst the father and
two others protected the rear of the beloved chieftain.Torquil, in
particular, kept close behind, for the purpose of covering him.Thus
Eachin stood in the centre of nine of the strongest men of his band,
having four especial defenders in front, one on each hand, and three in
his rear.The line of the Clan Chattan was arranged in precisely the same order,
only that the chief occupied the centre of the middle rank, instead of
being on the extreme right.This induced Henry Smith, who saw in the
opposing bands only one enemy, and that was the unhappy Eachin, to
propose placing himself on the left of the front rank of the Clan
Chattan.But the leader disapproved of this arrangement; and having
reminded Henry that he owed him obedience, as having taken wages at his
hand, he commanded him to occupy the space in the third line immediately
behind himself--a post of honour, certainly, which Henry could not
decline, though he accepted of it with reluctance.When the clans were thus drawn up opposed to each other, they intimated
their feudal animosity and their eagerness to engage by a wild scream,
which, uttered by the Clan Quhele, was answered and echoed back by
the Clan Chattan, the whole at the same time shaking their swords and
menacing each other, as if they meant to conquer the imagination of
their opponents ere they mingled in the actual strife.At this trying moment, Torquil, who had never feared for himself, was
agitated with alarm on the part of his dault, yet consoled by observing
that he kept a determined posture, and that the few words which he spoke
to his clan were delivered boldly, and well calculated to animate them
to combat, as expressing his resolution to partake their fate in death
or victory.The trumpets
of the King sounded a charge, the bagpipes blew up their screaming and
maddening notes, and the combatants, starting forward in regular order,
and increasing their pace till they came to a smart run, met together
in the centre of the ground, as a furious land torrent encounters an
advancing tide.For an instant or two the front lines, hewing at each other with their
long swords, seemed engaged in a succession of single combats; but the
second and third ranks soon came up on either side, actuated alike by
the eagerness of hatred and the thirst of honour, pressed through the
intervals, and rendered the scene a tumultuous chaos, over which the
huge swords rose and sunk, some still glittering, others streaming with
blood, appearing, from the wild rapidity with which they were swayed,
rather to be put in motion by some complicated machinery than to
be wielded by human hands.Some of the combatants, too much crowded
together to use those long weapons, had already betaken themselves to
their poniards, and endeavoured to get within the sword sweep of those
opposed to them.In the mean time, blood flowed fast, and the groans of
those who fell began to mingle with the cries of those who fought; for,
according to the manner of the Highlanders at all times, they could
hardly be said to shout, but to yell.Those of the spectators whose
eyes were best accustomed to such scenes of blood and confusion could
nevertheless discover no advantage yet acquired by either party.The
conflict swayed, indeed, at different intervals forwards or backwards,
but it was only in momentary superiority, which the party who acquired
it almost instantly lost by a corresponding exertion on the other side.The wild notes of the pipers were still heard above the tumult, and
stimulated to farther exertions the fury of the combatants.At once, however, and as if by mutual agreement, the instruments sounded
a retreat; it was expressed in wailing notes, which seemed to imply a
dirge for the fallen.The two parties disengaged themselves from each
other, to take breath for a few minutes.The eyes of the spectators
greedily surveyed the shattered array of the combatants as they drew
off from the contest, but found it still impossible to decide which had
sustained the greater loss.It seemed as if the Clan Chattan had lost
rather fewer men than their antagonists; but in compensation, the bloody
plaids and skirts of their party (for several on both sides had thrown
their mantles away) showed more wounded men than the Clan Quhele.About
twenty of both sides lay on the field dead or dying; and arms and legs
lopped off, heads cleft to the chin, slashes deep through the shoulder
into the breast, showed at once the fury of the combat, the ghastly
character of the weapons used, and the fatal strength of the arms which
wielded them.The chief of the Clan Chattan had behaved himself with
the most determined courage, and was slightly wounded.Eachin also had
fought with spirit, surrounded by his bodyguard.His sword was bloody,
his bearing bold and warlike; and he smiled when old Torquil, folding
him in his arms, loaded him with praises and with blessings.The two chiefs, after allowing their followers to breathe for the space
of about ten minutes, again drew up in their files, diminished by nearly
one third of their original number.They now chose their ground nearer
to the river than that on which they had formerly encountered, which
was encumbered with the wounded and the slain.Some of the former were
observed, from time to time, to raise themselves to gain a glimpse of
the field, and sink back, most of them to die from the effusion of blood
which poured from the terrific gashes inflicted by the claymore.Harry Smith was easily distinguished by his Lowland habit, as well as
his remaining on the spot where they had first encountered, where he
stood leaning on a sword beside a corpse, whose bonneted head, carried
to ten yards' distance from the body by the force of the blow which had
swept it off, exhibited the oak leaf, the appropriate ornament of the
bodyguard of Eachin MacIan.Since he slew this man, Henry had not struck
a blow, but had contented himself with warding off many that were dealt
at himself, and some which were aimed at the chief.MacGillie Chattanach
became alarmed, when, having given the signal that his men should again
draw together, he observed that his powerful recruit remained at a
distance from the ranks, and showed little disposition to join them."Can so strong a body have a mean
and cowardly spirit?"You as good as called me hireling but now," replied Henry."If I am
such," pointing to the headless corpse, "I have done enough for my day's
wage.""He that serves me without counting his hours," replied the chief, "I
reward him without reckoning wages.""Then," said the smith, "I fight as a volunteer, and in the post which
best likes me.""All that is at your own discretion," replied MacGillis Chattanach, who
saw the prudence of humouring an auxiliary of such promise."It is enough," said Henry; and, shouldering his heavy weapon, he joined
the rest of the combatants with alacrity, and placed himself opposite to
the chief of the Clan Quhele.It was then, for the first time, that Eachin showed some uncertainty.He had long looked up to Henry as the best combatant which Perth and its
neighbourhood could bring into the lists.His hatred to him as a rival
was mingled with recollection of the ease with which he had once, though
unarmed, foiled his own sudden and desperate attack; and when he beheld
him with his eyes fixed in his direction, the dripping sword in his
hand, and obviously meditating an attack on him individually, his
courage fell, and he gave symptoms of wavering, which did not escape his
foster father.It was lucky for Eachin that Torquil was incapable, from the formation
of his own temper, and that of those with whom he had lived, to conceive
the idea of one of his own tribe, much less of his chief and foster
son, being deficient in animal courage.Could he have imagined this, his
grief and rage might have driven him to the fierce extremity of taking
Eachin's life, to save him from staining his honour.But his mind
rejected the idea that his dault was a personal coward, as something
which was monstrous and unnatural.That he was under the influence of
enchantment was a solution which superstition had suggested, and he now
anxiously, but in a whisper, demanded of Hector: "Does the spell now
darken thy spirit, Eachin?""Yes, wretch that I am," answered the unhappy youth; "and yonder stands
the fell enchanter!"exclaimed Torquil, "and you wear harness of his making?Norman,
miserable boy, why brought you that accursed mail?""If my arrow has flown astray, I can but shoot my life after it,"
answered Norman nan Ord."Stand firm, you shall see me break the spell.""Yes, stand firm," said Torquil."He may be a fell enchanter; but my own
ear has heard, and my own tongue has told, that Eachin shall leave the
battle whole, free, and unwounded; let us see the Saxon wizard who can
gainsay that.He may be a strong man, but the fair forest of the oak
shall fall, stock and bough, ere he lay a finger on my dault.Ring
around him, my sons; bas air son Eachin!"The sons of Torquil shouted back the words, which signify, "Death for
Hector."Encouraged by their devotion, Eachin renewed his spirit, and called
boldly to the minstrels of his clan, "Seid suas" that is, "Strike up."The wild pibroch again sounded the onset; but the two parties approached
each other more slowly than at first, as men who knew and respected
each other's valour.Henry Wynd, in his impatience to begin the contest,
advanced before the Clan Chattan and signed to Eachin to come on.Norman, however, sprang forward to cover his foster brother, and there
was a general, though momentary, pause, as if both parties were willing
to obtain an omen of the fate of the day from the event of this duel.The Highlander advanced, with his large sword uplifted, as in act to
strike; but, just as he came within sword's length, he dropt the long
and cumbrous weapon, leapt lightly over the smith's sword, as he fetched
a cut at him, drew his dagger, and, being thus within Henry's guard,
struck him with the weapon (his own gift) on the side of the throat,
directing the blow downwards into the chest, and calling aloud, at the
same time, "You taught me the stab!"But Henry Wynd wore his own good hauberk, doubly defended with a lining
of tempered steel.Had he been less surely armed, his combats had been
ended for ever.Even as it was, he was slightly wounded.he replied, striking Norman a blow with the pommel of his long
sword, which made him stagger backwards, "you were taught the thrust,
but not the parry"; and, fetching a blow at his antagonist, which cleft
his skull through the steel cap, he strode over the lifeless body to
engage the young chief, who now stood open before him.But the sonorous voice of Torquil thundered out, "Far eil air son
Eachin!"and the two brethren who flanked their
chief on each side thrust forward upon Henry, and, striking both at
once, compelled him to keep the defensive.cried MacGillie Chattanach."Save the
brave Saxon; let these kites feel your talons!"Already much wounded, the chief dragged himself up to the smith's
assistance, and cut down one of the leichtach, by whom he was assailed.Henry's own good sword rid him of the other.answered two more of his
devoted sons, and opposed themselves to the fury of the smith and those
who had come to his aid; while Eachin, moving towards the left wing of
the battle, sought less formidable adversaries, and again, by some show
of valour, revived the sinking hopes of his followers.The two children
of the oak, who had covered, this movement, shared the fate of their
brethren; for the cry of the Clan Chattan chief had drawn to that part
of the field some of his bravest warriors.The sons of Torquil did not
fall unavenged, but left dreadful marks of their swords on the persons
of the dead and living.But the necessity of keeping their most
distinguished soldiers around the person of their chief told to
disadvantage on the general event of the combat; and so few were now
the number who remained fighting, that it was easy to see that the Clan
Chattan had fifteen of their number left, though most of them wounded,
and that of the Clan Quhele only about ten remained, of whom there were
four of the chief's bodyguard, including Torquil himself.They fought and struggled on, however, and as their strength decayed,
their fury seemed to increase.Henry Wynd, now wounded in many places,
was still bent on breaking through, or exterminating, the band of bold
hearts who continued to fight around the object of his animosity.But still the father's shout of "Another for Hector!"was cheerfully
answered by the fatal countersign, "Death for Hector!"and though the
Clan Quhele were now outnumbered, the combat seemed still dubious.It
was bodily lassitude alone that again compelled them to another pause.The Clan Chattan were then observed to be twelve in number, but two or
three were scarce able to stand without leaning on their swords.Five
were left of the Clan Quhele; Torquil and his youngest son were of the
number, both slightly wounded.Eachin alone had, from the vigilance
used to intercept all blows levelled against his person, escaped without
injury.The rage of both parties had sunk, through exhaustion, into
sullen desperation.They walked staggering, as if in their sleep,
through the carcasses of the slain, and gazed on them, as if again to
animate their hatred towards their surviving enemies by viewing the
friends they had lost.The multitude soon after beheld the survivors of the desperate conflict
drawing together to renew the exterminating feud on the banks of the
river, as the spot least slippery with blood, and less encumbered with
the bodies of the slain."For God's sake--for the sake of the mercy which we daily pray for,"
said the kind hearted old King to the Duke of Albany, "let this be
ended!Wherefore should these wretched rags and remnants of humanity be
suffered to complete their butchery?Surely they will now be ruled, and
accept of peace on moderate terms?""Compose yourself, my liege," said his brother."These men are the pest
of the Lowlands.Both chiefs are still living; if they go back unharmed,
the whole day's work is cast away.Remember your promise to the council,
that you would not cry 'hold.'""You compel me to a great crime, Albany, both as a king, who should
protect his subjects, and as a Christian man, who respects the brother
of his faith.""You judge wrong, my lord," said the Duke: "these are not loving
subjects, but disobedient rebels, as my Lord of Crawford can bear
witness; and they are still less Christian men, for the prior of the
Dominicans will vouch for me that they are more than half heathen.""You must work your pleasure, and are too wise
for me to contend with.I can but turn away and shut my eyes from the
sights and sounds of a carnage which makes me sicken.But well I know
that God will punish me even for witnessing this waste of human life.""Sound, trumpets," said Albany; "their wounds will stiffen if they dally
longer."While this was passing, Torquil was embracing and encouraging his young
chief."Resist the witchcraft but a few minutes longer!Be of good cheer, you
will come off without either scar or scratch, wem or wound."How can I be of good cheer," said Eachin, "while my brave kinsmen have
one by one died at my feet--died all for me, who could never deserve the
least of their kindness?""And for what were they born, save to die for their chief?""Why lament that the arrow returns not to the
quiver, providing it hit the mark?Here are Tormot and I
but little hurt, while the wildcats drag themselves through the plain
as if they were half throttled by the terriers.Yet one brave stand, and
the day shall be your own, though it may well be that you alone remain
alive.The pipers on both sides blew their charge, and the combatants again
mingled in battle, not indeed with the same strength, but with unabated
inveteracy.They were joined by those whose duty it was to have remained
neuter, but who now found themselves unable to do so.The two old
champions who bore the standards had gradually advanced from the
extremity of the lists, and now approached close to the immediate scene
of action.When they beheld the carnage more nearly, they were mutually
impelled by the desire to revenge their brethren, or not to survive
them.They attacked each other furiously with the lances to which the
standards were attached, closed after exchanging several deadly thrusts,
then grappled in close strife, still holding their banners, until at
length, in the eagerness of their conflict, they fell together into the
Tay, and were found drowned after the combat, closely locked in each
other's arms.The fury of battle, the frenzy of rage and despair,
infected next the minstrels.Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.The two pipers, who, during the conflict,
had done their utmost to keep up the spirits of their brethren, now saw
the dispute well nigh terminated for want of men to support it.They
threw down their instruments, rushed desperately upon each other with
their daggers, and each being more intent on despatching his opponent
than in defending himself, the piper of Clan Quhele was almost instantly
slain and he of Clan Chattan mortally wounded.The last, nevertheless,
again grasped his instrument, and the pibroch of the clan yet poured
its expiring notes over the Clan Chattan, while the dying minstrel had
breath to inspire it.The instrument which he used, or at least that
part of it called the chanter, is preserved in the family of a Highland
chief to this day, and is much honoured under the name of the federan
dhu, or, "black chanter."'Meanwhile, in the final charge, young Tormot, devoted, like his
brethren, by his father Torquil to the protection of his chief, had
been mortally wounded by the unsparing sword of the smith.The other
two remaining of the Clan Quhele had also fallen, and Torquil, with his
foster son and the wounded Tormot, forced to retreat before eight or ten
of the Clan Chattan, made a stand on the bank of the river, while their
enemies were making such exertions as their wounds would permit to come
up with them.Torquil had just reached the spot where he had resolved
to make the stand, when the young Tormot dropped and expired.His death
drew from his father the first and only sigh which he had breathed
throughout the eventful day.he said, "my youngest and dearest!But if I save
Hector, I save all.Now, my darling dault, I have done for thee all that
man may, excepting the last.Let me undo the clasps of that ill omened
armour, and do thou put on that of Tormot; it is light, and will fit
thee well.While you do so, I will rush on these crippled men, and make
what play with them I can.I trust I shall have but little to do, for
they are following each other like disabled steers.At least, darling of
my soul, if I am unable to save thee, I can show thee how a man should
die."While Torquil thus spoke, he unloosed the clasps of the young chief's
hauberk, in the simple belief that he could thus break the meshes which
fear and necromancy had twined about his heart."My father--my father--my more than parent," said the unhappy Eachin,
"stay with me!With you by my side, I feel I can fight to the last.""It is impossible," said Torquil."I will stop them coming up, while you
put on the hauberk.God eternally bless thee, beloved of my soul!"And then, brandishing his sword, Torquil of the Oak rushed forward
with the same fatal war cry which had so often sounded over that bloody
field, "Bas air son Eachin!"The words rung three times in a voice of
thunder; and each time that he cried his war shout he struck down one of
the Clan Chattan as he met them successively straggling towards him."Brave battle, hawk--well flown, falcon!"exclaimed the multitude,
as they witnessed exertions which seemed, even at this last hour, to
threaten a change of the fortunes of the day.Suddenly these cries were
hushed into silence, and succeeded by a clashing of swords so dreadful,
as if the whole conflict had recommenced in the person of Henry Wynd and
Torquil of the Oak.They cut, foined, hewed, and thrust as if they had
drawn their blades for the first time that day; and their inveteracy was
mutual, for Torquil recognised the foul wizard who, as he supposed, had
cast a spell over his child; and Henry saw before him the giant who,
during the whole conflict, had interrupted the purpose for which alone
he had joined the combatants--that of engaging in single combat with
Hector.They fought with an equality which, perhaps, would not have
existed, had not Henry, more wounded than his antagonist, been somewhat
deprived of his usual agility.Meanwhile Eachin, finding himself alone, after a disorderly and vain
attempt to put on his foster brother's harness, became animated by an
emotion of shame and despair, and hurried forward to support his foster
father in the terrible struggle, ere some other of the Clan Chattan
should come up.When he was within five yards, and sternly determined
to take his share in the death fight, his foster father fell, cleft
from the collarbone well nigh to the heart, and murmuring with his last
breath, "Bas air son Eachin!"The unfortunate youth saw the fall of
his last friend, and at the same moment beheld the deadly enemy who had
hunted him through the whole field standing within sword's point of
him, and brandishing the huge weapon which had hewed its way to his
life through so many obstacles.Perhaps this was enough to bring his
constitutional timidity to its highest point; or perhaps he recollected
at the same moment that he was without defensive armour, and that a
line of enemies, halting indeed and crippled, but eager for revenge and
blood, were closely approaching.It is enough to say, that his heart
sickened, his eyes darkened, his ears tingled, his brain turned giddy,
all other considerations were lost in the apprehension of instant death;
and, drawing one ineffectual blow at the smith, he avoided that which
was aimed at him in return by bounding backward; and, ere the former
could recover his weapon, Eachin had plunged into the stream of the Tay.A roar of contumely pursued him as he swam across the river, although,
perhaps, not a dozen of those who joined in it would have behaved
otherwise in the like circumstances.Henry looked after the fugitive in
silence and surprise, but could not speculate on the consequences of
his flight, on account of the faintness which seemed to overpower him
as soon as the animation of the contest had subsided.He sat down on
the grassy bank, and endeavoured to stanch such of his wounds as were
pouring fastest.The victors had the general meed of gratulation.The Duke of Albany and
others went down to survey the field; and Henry Wynd was honoured with
particular notice."If thou wilt follow me, good fellow," said the Black Douglas, "I
will change thy leathern apron for a knight's girdle, and thy burgage
tenement for an hundred pound land to maintain thy rank withal.""I thank you humbly, my lord," said the smith, dejectedly, "but I have
shed blood enough already, and Heaven has punished me by foiling the
only purpose for which I entered the combat.""Didst thou not fight for the Clan Chattan,
and have they not gained a glorious conquest?""I fought for my own hand," [meaning, I did such a thing for my own
pleasure, not for your profit] said the smith, indifferently; and the
expression is still proverbial in Scotland.The good King Robert now came up on an ambling palfrey, having entered
the barriers for the purpose of causing the wounded to be looked after."My lord of Douglas," he said, "you vex the poor man with temporal
matters when it seems he may have short timer to consider those that
are spiritual.Has he no friends here who will bear him where his bodily
wounds and the health of his soul may be both cared for?""He hath as many friends as there are good men in Perth," said Sir
Patrick Charteris, "and I esteem myself one of the closest.""A churl will savour of churl's kind," said the haughty Douglas, turning
his horse aside; "the proffer of knighthood from the sword of Douglas
had recalled him from death's door, had there been a drop of gentle
blood in his body."Disregarding the taunt of the mighty earl, the Knight of Kinfauns
dismounted to take Henry in his arms, as he now sunk back from very
faintness.But he was prevented by Simon Glover, who, with other
burgesses of consideration, had now entered the barrace."Oh, what tempted you
to this fatal affray?"No--not speechless," said Henry."Catharine--" He could utter no more."Catharine is well, I trust, and shall be thine--that is, if--"

"If she be safe, thou wouldst say, old man," said the Douglas, who,
though something affronted at Henry's rejection of his offer, was too
magnanimous not to interest himself in what was passing."She is safe,
if Douglas's banner can protect her--safe, and shall be rich.Douglas
can give wealth to those who value it more than honour.""For her safety, my lord, let the heartfelt thanks and blessings of a
father go with the noble Douglas.said the Earl: "a churl refuses nobility, a citizen despises
gold!""Under your lordship's favour," said Sir Patrick, "I, who am knight
and noble, take license to say, that such a brave man as Henry Wynd may
reject honourable titles, such an honest man as this reverend citizen
may dispense with gold.""You do well, Sir Patrick, to speak for your town, and I take no
offence," said the Douglas.But," he
added, in a whisper to Albany, "your Grace must withdraw the King from
this bloody sight, for he must know that tonight which will ring over
broad Scotland when tomorrow dawns.Yet even I
grieve that so many brave Scottishmen lie here slain, whose brands might
have decided a pitched field in their country's cause."With dignity King Robert was withdrawn from the field, the tears running
down his aged cheeks and white beard, as he conjured all around him,
nobles and priests, that care should be taken for the bodies and souls
of the few wounded survivors, and honourable burial rendered to
the slain.The priests who were present answered zealously for both
services, and redeemed their pledge faithfully and piously.Thus ended this celebrated conflict of the North Inch of Perth.Of
sixty-four brave men (the minstrels and standard bearers included)
who strode manfully to the fatal field, seven alone survived, who were
conveyed from thence in litters, in a case little different from the
dead and dying around them, and mingled with them in the sad procession
which conveyed them from the scene of their strife.Eachin alone had
left it void of wounds and void of honour.It remains but to say, that not a man of the Clan Quhele survived the
bloody combat except the fugitive chief; and the consequence of the
defeat was the dissolution of their confederacy.The clans of which it
consisted are now only matter of conjecture to the antiquary, for, after
this eventful contest, they never assembled under the same banner.The
Clan Chattan, on the other hand, continued to increase and flourish; and
the best families of the Northern Highlands boast their descent from the
race of the Cat a Mountain.While the King rode slowly back to the convent which he then occupied,
Albany, with a discomposed aspect and faltering voice, asked the Earl of
Douglas: "Will not your lordship, who saw this most melancholy scene at
Falkland, communicate the tidings to my unhappy brother?""Not for broad Scotland," said the Douglas."I would sooner bare my
breast, within flight shot, as a butt to an hundred Tynedale bowmen.I could but say I saw the ill fated youth dead.How he came by his death, your Grace can perhaps better explain.Were it
not for the rebellion of March and the English war, I would speak my own
mind of it."So saying, and making his obeisance to the King, the Earl rode off to
his own lodgings, leaving Albany to tell his tale as he best could."Ay, and
thine own interest, haughty earl, which, imperious as thou art, thou
darest not separate from mine.Well, since the task falls on me, I must
and will discharge it."The King looked at him with
surprise after he had assumed his usual seat."Thy countenance is ghastly, Robin," said the King."I would thou
wouldst think more deeply when blood is to be spilled, since its
consequences affect thee so powerfully.And yet, Robin, I love thee the
better that thy kind nature will sometimes show itself, even through thy
reflecting policy.""I would to Heaven, my royal brother," said Albany, with a voice half
choked, "that the bloody field we have seen were the worst we had to see
or hear of this day.I should waste little sorrow on the wild kerne who
lie piled on it like carrion.It must
be--it is Rothsay!"My lord--my liege, folly and mischance are now ended with my hapless
nephew.""Albany, as
thy brother, I conjure thee!But no, I am thy brother no longer.As thy
king, dark and subtle man, I charge thee to tell the worst."Albany faltered out: "The details are but imperfectly known to me; but
the certainty is, that my unhappy nephew was found dead in his apartment
last night from sudden illness--as I have heard.""Oh, Rothsay!--Oh, my beloved David!Would to God I had died for thee,
my son--my son!"So spoke, in the emphatic words of Scripture, the helpless and bereft
father, tearing his grey beard and hoary hair, while Albany, speechless
and conscience struck, did not venture to interrupt the tempest of his
grief.But the agony of the King's sorrow almost instantly changed to
fury--a mood so contrary to the gentleness and timidity of his nature,
that the remorse of Albany was drowned in his fear."And this is the end," said the King, "of thy moral saws and religious
maxims!But the besotted father who gave the son into thy hands--who
gave the innocent lamb to the butcher--is a king, and thou shalt know
it to thy cost.Shall the murderer stand in presence of his
brother--stained with the blood of that brother's son?What ho,
without there!--MacLouis!--Brandanes!Take arms, if
you love the Stuart!"MacLouis, with several of the guards, rushed into the apartment."Brandanes, your
noble Prince--" Here his grief and agitation interrupted for a moment
the fatal information it was his object to convey.At length he resumed
his broken speech: "An axe and a block instantly into the courtyard!Arrest--" The word choked his utterance."Arrest whom, my noble liege?"said MacLouis, who, observing the King
influenced by a tide of passion so different from the gentleness of his
ordinary demeanour, almost conjectured that his brain had been disturbed
by the unusual horrors of the combat he had witnessed."Whom shall I arrest, my liege?""Here is none but your
Grace's royal brother of Albany.""Most true," said the King, his brief fit of vindictive passion
soon dying away."Most true--none but Albany--none but my parent's
child--none but my brother.O God, enable me to quell the sinful passion
which glows in this bosom.Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis!"MacLouis cast a look of wonder towards the Duke of Albany, who
endeavoured to hide his confusion under an affectation of deep sympathy,
and muttered to the officer: "The great misfortune has been too much for
his understanding."not heard of the death of my nephew Rothsay?""The Duke of Rothsay dead, my Lord of Albany?"exclaimed the faithful
Brandane, with the utmost horror and astonishment."Two days since--the manner as yet unknown--at Falkland."MacLouis gazed at the Duke for an instant; then, with a kindling eye
and determined look, said to the King, who seemed deeply engaged in his
mental devotion: "My liege!a minute or two since you left a word--one
word--unspoken.Let it pass your lips, and your pleasure is law to your
Brandanes!""I was praying against temptation, MacLouis," said the heart broken
King, "and you bring it to me.Would you arm a madman with a
drawn weapon?my friend--my brother--my bosom
counsellor--how--how camest thou by the heart to do this?"Albany, seeing that the King's mood was softening, replied with more
firmness than before: "My castle has no barrier against the power of
death.I have not deserved the foul suspicions which your Majesty's
words imply.I pardon them, from the distraction of a bereaved father.But I am willing to swear by cross and altar, by my share in salvation,
by the souls of our royal parents--"

"Be silent, Robert!"said the King: "add not perjury to murder.And was
this all done to gain a step nearer to a crown and sceptre?Take them
to thee at once, man; and mayst thou feel as I have done, that they are
both of red hot iron!thou hast at least escaped
being a king!""My liege," said MacLouis, "let me remind you that the crown and sceptre
of Scotland are, when your Majesty ceases to bear them, the right of
Prince James, who succeeds to his brother's rights.""True, MacLouis," said the King, eagerly, "and will succeed, poor child,
to his brother's perils!You have reminded
me that I have still work upon earth.Get thy Brandanes under arms with
what speed thou canst.Let no man go with us whose truth is not known to
thee.None in especial who has trafficked with the Duke of Albany--that
man, I mean, who calls himself my brother--and order my litter to
be instantly prepared.We will to Dunbarton, MacLouis, or to Bute.Precipices, and tides, and my Brandanes' hearts shall defend the child
till we can put oceans betwixt him and his cruel uncle's ambition.Farewell, Robert of Albany--farewell for ever, thou hard hearted, bloody
man!Enjoy such share of power as the Douglas may permit thee.But seek
not to see my face again, far less to approach my remaining child; for,
that hour thou dost, my guards shall have orders to stab thee down with
their partizans!The Duke of Albany left the presence without attempting further
justification or reply.In the ensuing Parliament, the Duke
of Albany prevailed on that body to declare him innocent of the death
of Rothsay, while, at the same time, he showed his own sense of guilt by
taking out a remission or pardon for the offence.The unhappy and aged
monarch secluded himself in his Castle of Rothsay, in Bute, to mourn
over the son he had lost, and watch with feverish anxiety over the life
of him who remained.As the best step for the youthful James's security,
he sent him to France to receive his education at the court of the
reigning sovereign.But the vessel in which the Prince of Scotland
sailed was taken by an English cruiser, and, although there was a truce
for the moment betwixt the kingdoms, Henry IV ungenerously detained him
a prisoner.This last blow completely broke the heart of the unhappy
King Robert III.Vengeance followed, though with a slow pace, the
treachery and cruelty of his brother.Robert of Albany's own grey hairs
went, indeed, in peace to the grave, and he transferred the regency
which he had so foully acquired to his son Murdoch.But, nineteen years
after the death of the old King, James I returned to Scotland, and
Duke Murdoch of Albany, with his sons, was brought to the scaffold, in
expiation of his father's guilt and his own.The honest heart that's free frae a'
     Intended fraud or guile,
     However Fortune kick the ba',
     Has aye some cause to smile.We now return to the Fair Maid of Perth, who had been sent from the
horrible scene at Falkland by order of the Douglas, to be placed under
the protection of his daughter, the now widowed Duchess of Rothsay.That
lady's temporary residence was a religious house called Campsie, the
ruins of which still occupy a striking situation on the Tay.It arose on
the summit of a precipitous rock, which descends on the princely river,
there rendered peculiarly remarkable by the cataract called Campsie
Linn, where its waters rush tumultuously over a range of basaltic
rock, which intercepts the current, like a dike erected by human hands.Delighted with a site so romantic, the monks of the abbey of Cupar
reared a structure there, dedicated to an obscure saint, named St.Hunnand, and hither they were wont themselves to retire for pleasure or
devotion.It had readily opened its gates to admit the noble lady who
was its present inmate, as the country was under the influence of
the powerful Lord Drummond, the ally of the Douglas.There the Earl's
letters were presented to the Duchess by the leader of the escort which
conducted Catharine and the glee maiden to Campsie.Whatever reason
she might have to complain of Rothsay, his horrible and unexpected end
greatly shocked the noble lady, and she spent the greater part of the
night in indulging her grief and in devotional exercises.On the next morning, which was that of the memorable Palm Sunday, she
ordered Catharine Glover and the minstrel into her presence.The spirits
of both the young women had been much sunk and shaken by the dreadful
scenes in which they had so lately been engaged; and the outward
appearance of the Duchess Marjory was, like that of her father, more
calculated to inspire awe than confidence.She spoke with kindness,
however, though apparently in deep affliction, and learned from them
all which they had to tell concerning the fate of her erring and
inconsiderate husband.She appeared grateful for the efforts which
Catharine and the glee maiden had made, at their own extreme peril, to
save Rothsay from his horrible fate.She invited them to join in her
devotions; and at the hour of dinner gave them her hand to kiss, and
dismissed them to their own refection, assuring both, and Catharine in
particular, of her efficient protection, which should include, she said,
her father's, and be a wall around them both, so long as she herself
lived.They retired from the presence of the widowed Princess, and partook of
a repast with her duennas and ladies, all of whom, amid their profound
sorrow, showed a character of stateliness which chilled the light heart
of the Frenchwoman, and imposed restraint even on the more serious
character of Catharine Glover.The friends, for so we may now term them,
were fain, therefore, to escape from the society of these persons, all
of them born gentlewomen, who thought themselves but ill assorted with
a burgher's daughter and a strolling glee maiden, and saw them with
pleasure go out to walk in the neighbourhood of the convent.A little
garden, with its bushes and fruit trees, advanced on one side of the
convent, so as to skirt the precipice, from which it was only separated
by a parapet built on the ledge of the rock, so low that the eye might
easily measure the depth of the crag, and gaze on the conflicting waters
which foamed, struggled, and chafed over the reef below.The Fair Maiden of Perth and her companion walked slowly on a path that
ran within this parapet, looked at the romantic prospect, and judged
what it must be when the advancing summer should clothe the grove with
leaves.At length the gay
and bold spirit of the glee maiden rose above the circumstances in which
she had been and was now placed."Do the horrors of Falkland, fair May, still weigh down your spirits?Strive to forget them as I do: we cannot tread life's path lightly, if
we shake not from our mantles the raindrops as they fall.""These horrors are not to be forgotten," answered Catharine."Yet my
mind is at present anxious respecting my father's safety; and I cannot
but think how many brave men may be at this instant leaving the world,
even within six miles of us, or little farther.""You mean the combat betwixt sixty champions, of which the Douglas's
equerry told us yesterday?It were a sight for a minstrel to witness.But out upon these womanish eyes of mine--they could never see swords
cross each other without being dazzled.But see--look yonder, May
Catharine--look yonder!That flying messenger certainly brings news of
the battle.""Methinks I should know him who runs so wildly," said Catharine."But if
it be he I think of, some wild thoughts are urging his speed."As she spoke, the runner directed his course to the garden.Louise's
little dog ran to meet him, barking furiously, but came back, to
cower, creep, and growl behind its mistress; for even dumb animals can
distinguish when men are driven on by the furious energy of irresistible
passion, and dread to cross or encounter them in their career.The
fugitive rushed into the garden at the same reckless pace.His head was
bare, his hair dishevelled, his rich acton and all his other vestments
looked as if they had been lately drenched in water.His leathern
buskins were cut and torn, and his feet marked the sod with blood.His
countenance was wild, haggard, and highly excited, or, as the Scottish
phrase expresses it, much "raised."said Catharine, as he advanced, apparently without seeing
what was before him, as hares are said to do when severely pressed by
the greyhounds.But he stopped short when he heard his own name."Conachar," said Catharine, "or rather Eachin MacIan, what means all
this?Have the Clan Quhele sustained a defeat?""I have borne such names as this maiden gives me," said the fugitive,
after a moment's recollection."Yes, I was called Conachar when I was
happy, and Eachin when I was powerful.But now I have no name, and there
is no such clan as thou speak'st of; and thou art a foolish maid to
speak of that which is not to one who has no existence."unfortunate--"

"And why unfortunate, I pray you?""If I am coward
and villain, have not villainy and cowardice command over the elements?Have I not braved the water without its choking me, and trod the firm
earth without its opening to devour me?He will not
harm me; but I fear he will do evil to himself.See how he stares down
on the roaring waterfall!"The glee woman hastened to do as she was ordered, and Conachar's half
frenzied spirit seemed relieved by her absence."Catharine," he said, "now she is gone, I will say I know thee--I know
thy love of peace and hatred of war.But hearken; I have, rather than
strike a blow at my enemy, given up all that a man calls dearest: I have
lost honour, fame, and friends, and such friends!(he placed his hands
before his face).All know my shame; all should see my sorrow.Yes, all
might see, but who would pity it?Catharine, as I ran like a madman down
the strath, man and woman called'shame' on me!The beggar to whom I
flung an alms, that I might purchase one blessing, threw it back in
disgust, and with a curse upon the coward!Each bell that tolled rung
out, 'Shame on the recreant caitiff!'The brute beasts in their lowing
and bleating, the wild winds in their rustling and howling, the hoarse
waters in their dash and roar, cried, 'Out upon the dastard!'The
faithful nine are still pursuing me; they cry with feeble voice, 'Strike
but one blow in our revenge, we all died for you!'"While the unhappy youth thus raved, a rustling was heard in the bushes.he exclaimed, springing upon the parapet, but
with a terrified glance towards the thicket, through which one or two
attendants were stealing, with the purpose of surprising him.But the
instant he saw a human form emerge from the cover of the bushes, he
waved his hands wildly over his head, and shrieking out, "Bas air
Eachin!"plunged down the precipice into the raging cataract beneath.It is needless to say, that aught save thistledown must have been dashed
to pieces in such a fall.But the river was swelled, and the remains of
the unhappy youth were never seen.A varying tradition has assigned more
than one supplement to the history.It is said by one account, that the
young captain of Clan Quhele swam safe to shore, far below the Linns of
Campsie; and that, wandering disconsolately in the deserts of Rannoch,
he met with Father Clement, who had taken up his abode in the wilderness
as a hermit, on the principle of the old Culdees.He converted, it is
said, the heart broken and penitent Conachar, who lived with him in his
cell, sharing his devotion and privations, till death removed them in
succession.Another wilder legend supposes that he was snatched from death by the
daione shie, or fairy folk, and that he continues to wander through wood
and wild, armed like an ancient Highlander, but carrying his sword in
his left hand.Sometimes he
seems about to attack the traveller, but, when resisted with courage,
always flies.These legends are founded on two peculiar points in his
story--his evincing timidity and his committing suicide--both of them
circumstances almost unexampled in the history of a mountain chief.When Simon Glover, having seen his friend Henry duly taken care of in
his own house in Curfew Street, arrived that evening at the Place of
Campsie, he found his daughter extremely ill of a fever, in consequence
of the scenes to which she had lately been a witness, and particularly
the catastrophe of her late playmate.The affection of the glee maiden
rendered her so attentive and careful a nurse, that the glover said it
should not be his fault if she ever touched lute again, save for her own
amusement.It was some time ere Simon ventured to tell his daughter of Henry's late
exploits, and his severe wounds; and he took care to make the most of
the encouraging circumstance, that her faithful lover had refused both
honour and wealth rather than become a professed soldier and follow the
Douglas.Catharine sighed deeply and shook her head at the history of
bloody Palm Sunday on the North Inch.But apparently she had reflected
that men rarely advance in civilisation or refinement beyond the ideas
of their own age, and that a headlong and exuberant courage, like that
of Henry Smith, was, in the iron days in which they lived, preferable to
the deficiency which had led to Conachar's catastrophe.If she had
any doubts on the subject, they were removed in due time by Henry's
protestations, so soon as restored health enabled him to plead his own
cause."I should blush to say, Catharine, that I am even sick of the thoughts
of doing battle.Yonder last field showed carnage enough to glut a
tiger.I am therefore resolved to hang up my broadsword, never to be
drawn more unless against the enemies of Scotland.""And should Scotland call for it," said Catharine, "I will buckle it
round you.""And, Catharine," said the joyful glover, "we will pay largely for soul
masses for those who have fallen by Henry's sword; and that will not
only cure spiritual flaws, but make us friends with the church again.""For that purpose, father," said Catharine, "the hoards of the wretched
Dwining may be applied.He bequeathed them to me; but I think you would
not mix his base blood money with your honest gains?""I would bring the plague into my house as soon," said the resolute
glover.The treasures of the wicked apothecary were distributed accordingly
among the four monasteries; nor was there ever after a breath of
suspicion concerning the orthodoxy of old Simon or his daughter.Henry and Catharine were married within four months after the battle
of the North Inch, and never did the corporations of the glovers and
hammermen trip their sword dance so featly as at the wedding of the
boldest burgess and brightest maiden in Perth.Ten months after, a
gallant infant filled the well spread cradle, and was rocked by Louise
to the tune of--

     Bold and true,
     In bonnet blue.The names of the boy's sponsors are recorded, as "Ane Hie and Michty
Lord, Archibald Erl of Douglas, ane Honorabil and gude Knicht, Schir
Patrick Charteris of Kinfauns, and ane Gracious Princess, Marjory
Dowaire of his Serene Highness David, umquhile Duke of Rothsay."Under such patronage a family rises fast; and several of the most
respected houses in Scotland, but especially in Perthshire, and many
individuals distinguished both in arts and arms, record with pride their
descent from the Gow Chrom and the Fair Maid of Perth.P. Barlee, Esq., the actual governor of British
Honduras, has assured me that he has examined this seemingly indelible
imprint of the red hand on some rocks in caves in Australia.There is
scarcely a monument in Yucatan that does not preserve the imprint of
the open upraised hand, dipped in red paint of some sort, perfectly
visible on its walls.I lately took tracings of two of these imprints
that exist in the back saloon of the main hall, in the governor's house
at Uxmal, in order to calculate the height of the personage who thus
attested to those of his race, as I learned from one of my Indian
friends, who passes for a wizard, that the building was _in naa_, my
house.I may well say that the archway of the palace of the priests,
toward the court, was nearly covered with them.Yet I am not aware that
such symbol was ever used by the inhabitants of the countries bordering
on the shores of the Mediterranean or by the Assyrians, or that it ever
was discovered among the ruined temples or palaces of Egypt.The meaning of the red hand used by the aborigines of some parts of
America has been, it is well known, a subject of discussion for learned
men and scientific societies.Its uses as a symbol remained for a long
time a matter of conjecture.Schoolcraft had truly
arrived at the knowledge of its veritable meaning.Effectively, in the
2d column of the 5th page of the _New York Herald_ for April 12, 1879,
in the account of the visit paid by Gen.Grant to Ram Singh, Maharajah
of Jeypoor, we read the description of an excursion to the town of
Amber.Speaking of the journey to the _home of an Indian king_, among
other things the writer says:--"We passed small temples, some of them
ruined, some others with offerings of grains, or fruits, or flowers,
some with priests and people at worship.On the walls of some of the
temples we saw the marks of the human hand as though it had been steeped
in blood and pressed against the white wall.We were told that it was
the custom, when seeking from the gods some benison to note the vow by
putting the hand into a liquid and printing it on the wall.This was to
remind the gods of the vow and prayer.And if it came to pass in the
shape of rain, or food, or health, or children, the joyous devotee
returned to the temple and made other offerings."In Yucatan it seems to
have had the same meaning.That is to say: that the owners of the house
if private, or the priests, in the temples and public buildings, called
upon the edifices at the time of taking possession and using them for
the first time, the blessing of the Deity; and placed the hand's
imprints on the walls to recall the vows and prayer: and also, as the
interpretation communicated to me by the Indians seems to suggest, as a
signet or mark of property--_in naa_, my house.I need not speak of the similarity of many religious rites and beliefs
existing in Hindostan and among the inhabitants of _Mayab_.The worship
of the fire, of the phallus, of Deity under the symbol of the mastodon's
head, recalling that of Ganeza, the god with an elephant's head, hence
that of the elephant in Siam, Birmah[TN-13] and other places of the
Asiatic peninsula even in our day; and various other coincidences so
numerous and remarkable that many would not regard them as simple
coincidences.What to think, effectively, of the types of the personages
whose portraits are carved on the obelisks of Copan?Were they in Siam
instead of Honduras, who would doubt but they are Siameeses.[TN-14] What
to say of the figures of men and women sculptured on the walls of the
stupendous temples hewn, from the live rock, at Elephanta, so American
is their appearance and features?Who would not take them to be pure
aborigines if they were seen in Yucatan instead of Madras, Elephanta and
other places of India.If now we abandon that country and, crossing the Himalaya's range enter
Afghanistan, there again we find ourselves in a country inhabited by
Maya tribes; whose names, as those of many of their cities, are of pure
American-Maya origin.In the fourth column of the sixth page of the
London _Times_, weekly edition, of March 4, 1879, we read: "4,000 or
5,000 assembled on the opposite bank of the river _Kabul_, and it
appears that in that day or evening they attacked the Maya villages
situated on the north side of the river."He, the correspondent of the _Times_, tells us that Maya tribes form
still part of the population of Afghanistan.He also tells us that
_Kabul_ is the name of the river, on the banks of which their villages
are situated.But _Kabul_ is the name of an antique shrine in the city
of Izamal.of his History of
Yucatan, says: "They had another temple on another mound, on the west
side of the square, also dedicated to the same idol.They had there the
symbol of a hand, as souvenir.To that temple they carried their dead
and the sick.They called it _Kabul_, the working hand, and made there
great offerings."Father Lizana says the same: so we have two witnesses
to the fact._Kab_, in Maya means hand; and _Bul_ is to play at hazard.Many of the names of places and towns of Afghanistan have not only a
meaning in the American-Maya language, but are actually the same as
those of places and villages in Yucatan to-day, for example:

The Valley of _Chenar_ would be the valley of the _well of the woman's
children_--_chen_, well, and _al_, the woman's children.The fertile
valley of _Kunar_ would be the valley of the _god of the ears of corn_;
or, more probably, the _nest of the ears of corn_: as KU, pronounced
short, means _God_, and _Kuu_, pronounced long, is nest.NAL, is the
_ears of corn_.The correspondent of the London _Times_, in his letters, mentions the
names of some of the principal tribes, such as the _Kuki-Khel_, the
_Akakhel_, the _Khambhur Khel_, etc.The suffix Khel simply signifies
tribe, or clan.So similar to the Maya vocable _Kaan_, a tie, a rope;
hence a clan: a number of people held together by the tie of parentage.Now, Kuki would be Kukil, or Kukum maya[TN-15] for feather, hence the
KUKI-KHEL would be the tribe of the feather.AKA-KHEL in the same manner would be the tribe of the reservoir, or
pond.AKAL is the Maya name for the artificial reservoirs, or ponds in
which the ancient inhabitants of Mayab collected rain water for the time
of drought.Similarly the KHAMBHUR KHEL is the tribe of the _pleasant_: _Kambul_ in
Maya.It is the name of several villages of Yucatan, as you may satisfy
yourself by examining the map.We have also the ZAKA-KHEL, the tribe of the locust, ZAK.It is useless
to quote more for the present: enough to say that if you read the names
of the cities, valleys[TN-16] clans, roads even of Afghanistan to any of
the aborigines of Yucatan, they will immediately give you their meaning
in their own language.Before leaving the country of the Afghans, by the
KHIBER Pass--that is to say, the _road of the hawk_; HI, _hawk_, and
BEL, road--allow me to inform you that in examining their types, as
published in the London illustrated papers, and in _Harper's Weekly_, I
easily recognized the same cast of features as those of the bearded men,
whose portraits we discovered in the bas-reliefs which adorn the antae
and pillars of the castle, and queen's box in the Tennis Court at
Chichen-Itza.On our way to the coast of Asia Minor, and hence to Egypt, we may, in
following the Mayas' footsteps, notice that a tribe of them, the learned
MAGI, with their Rabmag at their head, established themselves in
Babylon, where they became, indeed, a powerful and influential body.Their chief they called _Rab-mag_--or LAB-MAC--the old person--LAB,
_old_--MAC, person; and their name Magi, meant learned men, magicians,
as that of Maya in India.I will directly speak more at length of
vestiges of the Mayas in Babylon, when explaining by means of the
_American Maya_, the meaning and probable etymology of the names of the
Chaldaic divinities.At present I am trying to follow the footprints of
the Mayas.On the coast of Asia Minor we find a people of a roving and piratical
disposition, whose name was, from the remotest antiquity and for many
centuries, the terror of the populations dwelling on the shores of the
Mediterranean; whose origin was, and is yet unknown; who must have
spoken Maya, or some Maya dialect, since we find words of that
language, and with the same meaning inserted in that of the Greeks, who,
Herodotus tells us, used to laugh at the manner the _Carians_, or
_Caras_, or _Caribs_, spoke their tongue; whose women wore a white linen
dress that required no fastening, just as the Indian and Mestiza women
of Yucatan even to-day[TN-17]

To tell you that the name of the CARAS is found over a vast extension of
country in America, would be to repeat what the late and lamented
Brasseur de Bourbourg has shown in his most learned introduction to the
work of Landa, "Relacion de las cosas de Yucatan;" but this I may say,
that the description of the customs and mode of life of the people of
Yucatan, even at the time of the conquest, as written by Landa, seems to
be a mere verbatim plagiarism of the description of the customs and mode
of life of the Carians of Asia Minor by Herodotus.If identical customs and manners, and the worship of the same divinities
under the same name, besides the traditions of a people pointing towards
a certain point of the globe as being the birth-place of their
ancestors, prove anything, then I must say that in Egypt also we meet
with the tracks of the Mayas, of whose name we again have a reminiscence
in that of the goddess Maia, the daughter of Atlantis, worshiped in
Greece.Here, at this end of the voyage, we seem to find an intimation
as to the place where the Mayas originated.We are told that Maya is
born from Atlantis; in other words, that the Mayas came from beyond the
Atlantic waters.Here, also, we find that Maia is called the mother of
the gods _Kubeles_._Ku_, Maya _God_, _Bel_ the road, the way.Ku-bel,
the road, the origin of the gods as among the Hindostanees.These, we
have seen in the Rig Veda, called Maya, the feminine energy--the
productive virtue of Brahma.I do not pretend to present here anything but facts, resulting from my
study of the ancient monuments of Yucatan, and a comparative study of
the Maya language, in which the ancient inscriptions, I have been able
to decipher, are written.Let us see if those _facts_ are sustained by
others of a different character.I will make a brief parallel between the architectural monuments of the
primitive Chaldeans, their mode of writing, their burial places, and
give you the etymology of the names of their divinities in the American
Maya language.The origin of the primitive Chaldees is yet an unsettled matter among
learned men.All agree,
however, that they were strangers to the lower Mesopotamian valleys,
where they settled in very remote ages, their capital being, in the time
of Abraham, as we learn from Scriptures, _Ur_ or _Hur_.So named either
because its inhabitants were worshipers of the moon, or from the moon
itself--U in the Maya language--or perhaps also because the founders
being strangers and guests, as it were, in the country, it was called
the city of guests, HULA (Maya), _guest just arrived_.Recent researches in the plains of lower Mesopotamia have revealed to us
their mode of building their sacred edifices, which is precisely
identical to that of the Mayas.It consisted of mounds composed of superposed platforms, either square
or oblong, forming cones or pyramids, their angles at times, their faces
at others, facing exactly the cardinal points.Their manner of construction was also the same, with the exception of
the materials employed--each people using those most at hand in their
respective countries--clay and bricks in Chaldea, stones in Yucatan.The
filling in of the buildings being of inferior materials, crude or
sun-dried bricks at Warka and Mugheir; of unhewn stones of all shapes
and sizes, in Uxmal and Chichen, faced with walls of hewn stones, many
feet in thickness throughout.Grand exterior staircases lead to the
summit, where was the shrine of the god, and temple.In Yucatan these mounds are generally composed of seven superposed
platforms, the one above being smaller than that immediately below; the
temple or sanctuary containing invariably two chambers, the inner one,
the Sanctum Sanctorum, being the smallest.In Babylon, the supposed tower of Babel--the _Birs-i-nimrud_--the temple
of the seven lights, was made of seven stages or platforms.The roofs of these buildings in both countries were flat; the walls of
vast thickness; the chambers long and narrow, with outer doors opening
into them directly; the rooms ordinarily let into one another: squared
recesses were common in the rooms.Loftus is of opinion that the
chambers of the Chaldean buildings were usually arched with bricks, in
which opinion Mr.We know that the ceilings of the
chambers in all the monuments of Yucatan, without exception, form
triangular arches.To describe their construction I will quote from the
description by Herodotus, of some ceilings in Egyptian buildings and
Scythian tombs, that resemble that of the brick vaults found at Mugheir."The side walls <DW72> outward as they ascend, the arch is formed by each
successive layer of brick from the point where the arch begins, a little
overlapping the last, till the two sides of the roof are brought so near
together, that the aperture may be closed by a single brick."Some of the sepulchers found in Yucatan are very similar to the jar
tombs common at Mugheir.These consist of two large open-mouthed jars,
united with bitumen after the body has been deposited in them, with the
usual accompaniments of dishes, vases and ornaments, having an air hole
bored at one extremity.Those found at Progreso were stone urns about
three feet square, cemented in pairs, mouth to mouth, and having also an
air hole bored in the bottom.Extensive mounds, made artificially of a
vast number of coffins, arranged side by side, divided by thin walls of
masonry crossing each other at right angles, to separate the coffins,
have been found in the lower plains of Chaldea--such as exist along the
coast of Peru, and in Yucatan.At Izamal many human remains, contained
in urns, have been found in the mounds."The ordinary dress of the common people among the Chaldeans," says
Canon Rawlison, in his work, the Five Great Monarchies, "seems to have
consisted of a single garment, a short tunic tied round the waist, and
reaching thence to the knees.To this may sometimes have been added an
_abba_, or cloak, thrown over the shoulders; the material of the former
we may perhaps presume to have been linen."The mural paintings at
Chichen show that the Mayas sometimes used the same costume; and that
dress is used to-day by the aborigines of Yucatan, and the inhabitants
of the _Tierra de Guerra_.They were also bare-footed, and wore on the
head a band of cloth, highly ornamented with mother-of-pearl instead of
camel's hair, as the Chaldee.This band is to be seen in bas-relief at
Chichen-Itza, inthe[TN-18] mural paintings, and on the head of the statue
of Chaacmol.The higher classes wore a long robe extending from the neck
to the feet, sometimes adorned with a fringe; it appears not to have
been fastened to the waist, but kept in place by passing over one
shoulder, a slit or hole being made for the arm on one side of the dress
only.In some cases the upper part of the dress seems to have been
detached from the lower, and to form a sort of jacket which reached
about to the hips.We again see this identical dress portrayed in the
mural paintings.The same description of ornaments were affected by the
Chaldees and the Mayas--bracelets, earrings, armlets, anklets, made of
the materials they could procure.The Mayas at times, as can be seen from the slab discovered by
Bresseur[TN-19] in Mayapan (an exact fac-simile of which cast, from a
mould made by myself, is now in the rooms of the American Antiquarian
Society at Worcester, Mass.), as the primitive Chaldee, in their
writings, made use of characters composed of straight lines only,
inclosed in square or oblong figures; as we see from the inscriptions in
what has been called hieratic form of writing found at Warka and
Mugheir and the slab from Mayapan and others.The Chaldees are said to have made use of three kinds of characters that
Canon Rawlinson calls _letters proper_, _monograms_ and _determinative_.The Maya also, as we see from the monumental inscriptions, employed
three kinds of characters--_letters proper_, _monograms_ and
_pictorial_.It may be said of the religion of the Mayas, as I have had occasion to
remark, what the learned author of the Five Great Monarchies says of
that of the primitive Chaldees: "The religion of the Chaldeans, from the
very earliest times to which the monuments carry us back, was, in its
outward aspect, a polytheism of a very elaborate character.It is quite
possible that there may have been esoteric explanations, known to the
priests and the more learned; which, resolving the personages of the
Pantheon into the powers of nature, reconcile the apparent multiplicity
of Gods with monotheism."I will now consider the names of the Chaldean
deities in their turn of rotation as given us by the author above
mentioned, and show you that the language of the American Mayas gives us
an etymology of the whole of them, quite in accordance with their
particular attributes.The learned author places '_Ra_' at the head of the Pantheon, stating
that the meaning of the word is simply _God_, or the God emphatically.We know that _Ra_ was the Sun among the Egyptians, and that the
hieroglyph, a circle, representation of that God was the same in Babylon
as in Egypt.It formed an element in the native name of Babylon.Now the Mayas called LA, that which has existed for ever, the truth _par
excellence_.As to the native name of Babylon it would simply be the
_city of the infinite truth_--_cah_, city; LA, eternal truth.Ana, like Ra, is thought to have signified _God_ in the highest sense.His epithets mark priority and
antiquity; _the original chief_, the _father of the gods_, the _lord of
darkness or death_.The Maya gives us A, _thy_; NA, _mother_.At times
he was called DIS, and was the patron god of _Erech_, the great city of
the dead, the necropolis of Lower Babylonia.TIX, Maya is a cavity
formed in the earth.It seems to have given its name to the city of
_Niffer_, called _Calneh_ in the translation of the Septuagint, from
_kal-ana_, which is translated the "fort of Ana;" or according to the
Maya, the _prison of Ana_, KAL being prison, or the prison of thy
mother.ANATA

the supposed wife of Ana, has no peculiar characteristics.Her name is
only, says our author, the feminine form of the masculine, Ana.But the
Maya designates her as the companion of Ana; TA, with; _Anata_ with
_Ana_.BIL OR ENU

seems to mean merely Lord.It is usually followed by a qualificative
adjunct, possessing great interest, NIPRU.To that name, which recalls
that of NEBROTH or _Nimrod_, the author gives a Syriac etymology; napar
(make to flee).His epithets are the _supreme_, _the father of the
gods_, the _procreator_.The Maya gives us BIL, or _Bel_; the way, the road; hence the _origin_,
the father, the procreator.Also ENA, who is before; again the father,
the procreator.As to the qualificative adjunct _nipru_.It would seem to be the Maya
_niblu_; _nib_, to thank; LU, the _Bagre_, a _silurus fish_._Niblu_
would then be the _thanksgiving fish_.Strange to say, the high priest
at Uxmal and Chichen, elder brother of Chaacmol, first son of _Can_, the
founder of those cities, is CAY, the fish, whose effigy is my last
discovery in June, among the ruins of Uxmal.The bust is contained
within the jaws of a serpent, _Can_, and over it, is a beautiful
mastodon head, with the trunk inscribed with Egyptian characters, which
read TZAA, that which is necessary.BELTIS

is the wife of _Bel-nipru_.But she is more than his mere female power.Her common title is the _Great
Goddess_.In Chaldea her name was _Mulita_ or _Enuta_, both words
signifying the lady.Her favorite title was the _mother of the gods_,
the origin of the gods.In Maya BEL is the road, the way; and TE means _here_.BELTE or BELTIS
would be I am the way, the origin._Mulita_ would correspond to MUL-TE, many here, _many in me_.Her other name _Enuta_ seems to be (Maya) _Ena-te_,
signifies ENA, the first, before anybody, and TE here.ENATE, _I am here
before anybody_, I am the mother of the Gods.The God Fish, the mystic animal, half man, half fish, which came up from
the Persian gulf to teach astronomy and letters to the first settlers on
the Euphrates and Tigris.According to Berosus the civilization was brought to Mesopotamia by
_Oannes_ and six other beings, who, like himself, were half man, half
fish, and that they came from the Indian Ocean.We have already seen
that the Mayas of India were not only architects, but also astronomers;
and the symbolic figure of a being half man and half fish seems to
clearly indicate that those who brought civilization to the shores of
the Euphrates and Tigris came in boats.Hoa-Ana, or Oannes, according to the Maya would mean, he who has his
residence or house on the water.HA, being water; _a_, thy; _na_, house;
literally, _water thy house_.Canon Rawlison remarks in that
connection: "There are very strong grounds for connecting HEA or Hoa,
with the serpent of the Scripture, and the paradisaical traditions of
the tree of knowledge and the tree of life."As the title of the god of
knowledge and science, _Oannes_, is the lord of the abyss, or of the
great deep, the intelligent fish, one of his emblems being the serpent,
CAN, which occupies so conspicuous a place among the symbols of the gods
on the black stones recording benefactions.DAV-KINA

Is the wife of _Hoa_, and her name is thought to signify the chief lady.But the Maya again gives us another meaning that seems to me more
appropriate.TAB-KIN would be the _rays of the sun_: the rays of the
light brought with civilization by her husband to benighted inhabitants
of Mesopotamia.SIN OR HURKI

is the name of the moon deity; the etymology of it is quite uncertain.Its titles, as Rawlison remarks, are somewhat vague.Yet it is
particularly designated as "_the bright_, _the shining_" the lord of the
month.Zin in Maya has also many significations._Zinil_ is the extension of the whole of the universe._Hurki_ would be
the Maya HULKIN--sun-stroked; he who receives directly the rays of the
sun.Hurki is also the god presiding over buildings and architecture; in
this connection he is called _Bel-Zuna_.The _lord of building_, the
_supporting architect_, the _strengthener of fortifications_._Bel-Zuna_
would also signify the lord of the strong house._Zuu_, Maya, close,
thick._Na_, house: and the city where he had his great temple was _Ur_;
named after him._U_, in Maya, signifies moon.SAN OR SANSI,

the Sun God, the _lord of fire_, the _ruler of the day_.He _who
illumines the expanse of heaven and earth_._Zamal_ (Maya) is the morning, the dawn of the day, and his symbols are
the same on the temples of Yucatan as on those of Chaldea, India and
Egypt.VUL OR IVA,

the prince of the powers of the air, the lord of the whirlwind and the
tempest, the wielder of the thunderbolt, the lord of the air, he who
makes the tempest to rage.Hiba in Maya is to rub, to scour, to chafe as
does the tempest.As VUL he is represented with a flaming sword in his
hand._Hul_ (Maya) an arrow.He is then the god of the atmosphere, who
gives rain.ISHTAR OR NANA,

the Chaldean Venus, of the etymology of whose name no satisfactory
account can be given, says the learned author, whose list I am following
and description quoting.The Maya language, however, affords a very natural etymology.Her name
seems composed of _ix_, the feminine article, _she_; and of _tac_, or
_tal_, a verb that signifies to have a desire to satisfy a corporal want
or inclination.IXTAL would, therefore, be she who desires to satisfy a
corporal inclination.As to her other name, _Nana_, it simply means the
great mother, the very mother.If from the names of god and goddesses,
we pass to that of places, we will find that the Maya language also
furnishes a perfect etymology for them.In the account of the creation of the world, according to the Chaldeans,
we find that a woman whose name in Chaldee is _Thalatth_, was said to
have ruled over the monstrous animals of strange forms, that were
generated and existed in darkness and water.The Greek called her
_Thalassa_ (the sea).But the Maya vocable _Thallac_, signifies a thing
without steadiness, like the sea.The first king of the Chaldees was a great architect.To him are
ascribed the most archaic monuments of the plains of Lower Mesopotamia.He is said to have conceived the plans of the Babylonian Temple.He
constructed his edifices of mud and bricks, with rectangular bases,
their angles fronting the cardinal points; receding stages, exterior
staircases, with shrines crowning the whole structure.In this
description of the primitive constructions of the Chaldeans, no one can
fail to recognize the Maya mode of building, and we see them not only in
Yucatan, but throughout Central America, Peru, even Hindoostan.The very
name _Urkuh_ seems composed of two Maya words HUK, to make everything,
and LUK, mud; he who makes everything of mud; so significative of his
building propensities and of the materials used by him.The etymology of the name of that country, as well as that of Asshur,
the supreme god of the Assyrians, who never pronounced his name without
adding "Asshur is my lord," is still an undecided matter amongst the
learned philologists of our days.Some contend that the country was
named after the god Asshur; others that the god Asshur received his name
from the place where he was worshiped.None agree, however, as to the
significative meaning of the name Asshur.In Assyrian and Hebrew
languages the name of the country and people is derived from that of the
god.That Asshur was the name of the deity, and that the country was
named after it, I have no doubt, since I find its etymology, so much
sought for by philologists, in the American Maya language.Effectively
the word _asshur_, sometimes written _ashur_, would be AXUL in Maya._A_, in that language, placed before a noun, is the possessive pronoun,
as the second person, thy or thine, and _xul_, means end, termination.It is also the name of the sixth month of the Maya calendar._Axul_
would therefore be _thy end_.Among all the nations which have
recognized the existence of a SUPREME BEING, Deity has been considered
as the beginning and end of all things, to which all aspire to be
united.A strange coincidence that may be without significance, but is not out
of place to mention here, is the fact that the early kings of Chaldea
are represented on the monuments as sovereigns over the _Kiprat-arbat_,
or FOUR RACES.While tradition tells us that the great lord of the
universe, king of the giants, whose capital was _Tiahuanaco_, the
magnificent ruins of which are still to be seen on the shores of the
lake of Titicaca, reigned over _Ttahuatyn-suyu_, the FOUR PROVINCES.In
the _Chou-King_ we read that in very remote times _China_ was called by
its inhabitants _Sse-yo_, THE FOUR PARTS OF THE EMPIRE.The
_Manava-Dharma-Sastra_, the _Ramayana_, and other sacred books of
Hindostan also inform us that the ancient Hindoos designated their
country as the FOUR MOUNTAINS, and from some of the monumental
inscriptions at Uxmal it would seem that, among other names, that place
was called the land of the _canchi_, or FOUR MOUTHS, that recalls
vividly the name of Chaldea _Arba-Lisun_, the FOUR TONGUES.That the language of the Mayas was known in Chaldea in remote ages, but
became lost in the course of time, is evident from the Book of Daniel.It seems that some of the learned men of Judea understood it still at
the beginning of the Christian era, as many to-day understand Greek,
Latin, Sanscrit, &c.; since, we are informed by the writers of the
Gospels of St.Mark, that the last words of Jesus of
Nazareth expiring on the cross were uttered in it.In the fifth chapter of the Book of Daniel, we read that the fingers of
the hand of a man were seen writing on the wall of the hall, where King
Belshazzar was banqueting, the words "Mene, mene, Tekel, upharsin,"
which could not be read by any of the wise men summoned by order of the
king.Daniel, however, being brought in, is said to have given as their
interpretation: _Numbered_, _numbered_, _weighed_, _dividing_, perhaps
with the help of the angel Gabriel, who is said by learned rabbins to be
the only individual of the angelic hosts who can speak Chaldean and
Syriac, and had once before assisted him in interpreting the dream of
King Nebuchadnezzar.Perhaps also, having been taught the learning of
the Chaldeans, he had studied the ancient Chaldee language, and was thus
enabled to read the fatidical words, which have the very same meaning in
the Maya language as he gave them.Effectively, _mene_ or _mane_,
_numbered_, would seem to correspond to the Maya verbs, MAN, to buy, to
purchase, hence to number, things being sold by the quantity--or MANEL,
to pass, to exceed._Tekel_, weighed, would correspond to TEC, light.To-day it is used in the sense of lightness in motion, brevity,
nimbleness: and _Upharsin_, dividing, seem allied to the words PPA, to
divide two things united; or _uppah_, to break, making a sharp sound; or
_paah_, to break edifices; or, again, PAALTAL, to break, to scatter the
inhabitants of a place.As to the last words of Jesus of Nazareth, when expiring on the cross,
as reported by the Evangelists, _Eli, Eli_, according to St.Matthew,
and _Eloi, Eloi_, according to St.Mark, _lama sabachthani_, they are
pure Maya vocables; but have a very different meaning to that attributed
to them, and more in accordance with His character.By placing in the
mouth of the dying martyr these words: _My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me?_ they have done him an injustice, presenting him in his
last moments despairing and cowardly, traits so foreign to his life, to
his teachings, to the resignation shown by him during his trial, and to
the fortitude displayed by him in his last journey to Calvary; more than
all, so unbecoming, not to say absurd, being in glaring contradiction to
his role as God.If God himself, why complain that God has forsaken him?He evidently did not speak Hebrew in dying, since his two mentioned
biographers inform us that the people around him did not understand what
he said, and supposed he was calling Elias to help him: _This man
calleth for Elias._

His bosom friend, who never abandoned him--who stood to the last at the
foot of the cross, with his mother and other friends and relatives, do
not report such unbefitting words as having been uttered by Jesus.He
simply says, that after recommending his mother to his care, he
complained of being thirsty, and that, as the sponge saturated with
vinegar was applied to his mouth, he merely said: IT IS FINISHED!and
_he bowed his head and gave up the ghost_.Well, this is exactly the meaning of the Maya words, HELO, HELO, LAMAH
ZABAC TA NI, literally: HELO, HELO, now, now; LAMAH, sinking; ZABAC,
black ink; TA, over; NI, nose; in our language: _Now, now I am sinking;
darkness covers my face!_ No weakness, no despair--He merely tells his
friends all is over.Before leaving Asia Minor, in order to seek in Egypt the vestiges of the
Mayas, I will mention the fact that the names of some of the natives who
inhabited of old that part of the Asiatic continent, and many of those
of places and cities seem to be of American Maya origin.The Promised
Land, for example--that part of the coast of Phoenicia so famous for
the fertility of its soil, where the Hebrews, after journeying during
forty years in the desert, arrived at last, tired and exhausted from so
many hard-fought battles--was known as _Canaan_.This is a Maya word
that means to be tired, to be fatigued; and, if it is spelled _Kanaan_,
it then signifies abundance; both significations applying well to the
country.TYRE, the great emporium of the Phoenicians, called _Tzur_, probably
on account of being built on a rock, may also derive its name from the
Maya TZUC, a promontory, or a number of villages, _Tzucub_ being a
province.Again, we have the people called _Khati_ by the Egyptians.They formed a
great nation that inhabited the _Caele-Syria_ and the valley of the
Orontes, where they have left very interesting proofs of their passage
on earth, in large and populous cities whose ruins have been lately
discovered.Their origin is unknown, and is yet a problem to be solved.They are celebrated on account of their wars against the Assyrians and
Egyptians, who call them the plague of Khati.Their name is frequently
mentioned in the Scriptures as Hittites.Placed on the road, between the
Assyrians and the Egyptians, by whom they were at last vanquished, they
placed well nigh insuperable _obstacles in the way_ of the conquests of
these two powerful nations, which found in them tenacious and fearful
adversaries.The Khati had not only made considerable improvements in
all military arts, but were also great and famed merchants; their
emporium _Carchemish_ had no less importance than Tyre or Carthage.There, met merchants from all parts of the world; who brought thither
the products and manufactures of their respective countries, and were
wont to worship at the Sacred City, _Katish_ of the Khati.The etymology
of their name is also unknown.Some historians having pretended that
they were a Scythian tribe, derived it from Scythia; but I think that we
may find it very natural, as that of their principal cities, in the Maya
language.All admit that the Khati, until the time when they were vanquished by
Rameses the Great, as recorded on the walls of his palace at Thebes, the
_Memnonium_, always placed obstacles on the way of the Egyptians and
opposed them.According to the Maya, their name is significative of
these facts, since KAT or KATAH is a verb that means to place
impediments on the road, to come forth and obstruct the passage._Carchemish_ was their great emporium, where merchants from afar
congregated; it was consequently a city of merchants.CAH means a city,
and _Chemul_ is navigator._Carchemish_ would then be _cah-chemul_, the
city of navigators, of merchants.KATISH, their sacred city, would be the city where sacrifices are
offered.CAH, city, and TICH, a ceremony practiced by the ancient Mayas,
and still performed by their descendants all through Central America.This sacrifice or ceremony consists in presenting to BALAM, the
_Yumil-Kaax_, the "Lord of the fields," the _primitiae_ of all their
fruits before beginning the harvest.Katish, or _cah-tich_ would then be
the city of the sacrifices--the holy city.EGYPT is the country that in historical times has called, more than any
other, the attention of the students, of all nations and in all ages, on
account of the grandeur and beauty of its monuments; the peculiarity of
its inhabitants; their advanced civilization, their great attainments in
all branches of human knowledge and industry; and its important position
at the head of all other nations of antiquity.Egypt has been said to be
the source from which human knowledge began to flow over the old world:
yet no one knows for a certainty whence came the people that laid the
first foundations of that interesting nation.That they were not
autochthones is certain.Their learned priests pointed towards the
regions of the West as the birth-place of their ancestors, and
designated the country in which they lived, the East, as the _pure
land_, the _land of the sun_, of _light_, in contradistinction of the
country of the dead, of darkness--the Amenti, the West--where Osiris sat
as King, reigning judge, over the souls.If in Hindostan, Afghanistan, Chaldea, Asia Minor, we have met with
vestiges of the Mayas, in Egypt we will find their traces everywhere.Whatever may have been the name given to the valley watered by the Nile
by its primitive inhabitants, no one at present knows.The invaders that
came from the West called it CHEM: not on account of the black color of
the soil, as Plutarch pretends in his work, "_De Iside et Osiride_," but
more likely because either they came to it in boats; or, quite probably,
because when they arrived the country was inundated, and the inhabitants
communicated by means of boats, causing the new comers to call it the
country of boats--CHEM (maya).[TN-20] The hieroglyph representing the
name of Egypt is composed of the character used for land, a cross
circumscribed by a circle, and of another, read K, which represent a
sieve, it is said, but that may likewise be the picture of a small boat.The Assyrians designated Egypt under the names of MISIR or MISUR,
probably because the country is generally destitute of trees.These are
uprooted during the inundations, and then carried by the currents all
over the country; so that the farmers, in order to be able to plow the
soil, are obliged to clear it first from the dead trees.Now we have the
Maya verb MIZ--to _clean_, to _remove rubbish formed by the body of dead
trees_; whilst the verb MUSUR means to _cut the trees by the roots_.It
would seem that the name _Mizraim_ given to Egypt in the Scriptures also
might come from these words.When the Western invaders reached the country it was probably covered by
the waters of the river, to which, we are told, they gave the name of
_Hapimu_.Its etymology seems to be yet undecided by the Egyptologists,
who agree, however, that its meaning is the _abyss of water_.The Maya
tells us that this name is composed of two words--HA, water, and PIMIL,
the thickness of flat things._Hapimu_, or HAPIMIL, would then be the
thickness, the _abyss of water_.We find that the prophets _Jeremiah_ (xlvi., 25,) and _Nahum_ (iii., 8,
10,) call THEBES, the capital of upper Egypt during the XVIII.dynasty:
NO or NA-AMUN, the mansion of Amun._Na_ signifies in Maya, house,
mansion, residence.But _Thebes_ is written in Egyptian hieroglyphs AP,
or APE, the meaning of which is the head, the capital; with the feminine
article T, that is always used as its prefix in hieroglyphic writings,
it becomes TAPE; which, according to Sir Gardner Wilkinson ("Manners and
Customs of the Ancient Egyptians," _tom._ III., page 210, N. Y. Edition,
1878), was pronounced by the Egyptians _Taba_; and in the Menphitic
dialect Thaba, that the Greeks converted into Thebai, whence Thebes.The
Maya verb _Teppal_, signifies to reign, to govern, to order.On each
side of the mastodons' heads, which form so prominent a feature in the
ornaments of the oldest edifices at Uxmal, Chichen-Itza and other parts,
the word _Dapas_; hence TABAS is written in ancient Egyptian characters,
and read, I presume, in old Maya, _head_.To-day the word is pronounced
THAB, and means _baldness_.The identity of the names of deities worshiped by individuals, of their
religious rites and belief; that of the names of the places which they
inhabit; the similarity of their customs, of their dresses and manners;
the sameness of their scientific attainments and of the characters used
by them in expressing their language in writing, lead us naturally to
infer that they have had a common origin, or, at least, that their
forefathers were intimately connected.If we may apply this inference to
nations likewise, regardless of the distance that to-day separates the
countries where they live, I can then affirm that the Mayas and the
Egyptians are either of a common descent, or that very intimate
communication must have existed in remote ages between their ancestors.Without entering here into a full detail of the customs and manners of
these people, I will make a rapid comparison between their religious
belief, their customs, manners, scientific attainments, and the
characters used by them in writing etc., sufficient to satisfy any
reasonable body that the strange coincidences that follow, cannot be
altogether accidental.The SUN, RA, was the supreme god worshiped throughout the land of Egypt;
and its emblem was a disk or circle, at times surmounted by the serpent
Uraeus.Egypt was frequently called the Land of the Sun.RA or LA
signifies in Maya that which exists, emphatically that which is--the
truth.The sun was worshiped by the ancient Mayas; and the Indians to-day
preserve the dance used by their forefathers among the rites of the
adoration of that luminary, and perform it yet in certain epoch[TN-21]
of the year.The coat-of-arms of the city of Uxmal, sculptured on the
west facade of the sanctuary, attached to the masonic temple in that
city, teaches us that the place was called U LUUMIL KIN, _the land of
the sun_.This name forming the center of the escutcheon, is written
with a cross, circumscribed by a circle, that among the Egyptians is
the sign for land, region, surrounded by the rays of the sun.Colors in Egypt, as in Mayab, seem to have had the same symbolical
meaning.The figure of _Amun_ was that of a man whose body was light
blue, like the Indian god Wishnu,[TN-22] and that of the god Nilus; as if
to indicate their peculiar exalted and heavenly nature; this color being
that of the pure, bright skies above.The blue color had exactly the
same significance in Mayab, according to Landa and Cogolludo, who tell
us that, even at the time of the Spanish conquest, the bodies of those
who were to be sacrificed to the gods were painted blue.The mural
paintings in the funeral chamber of Chaacmol, at Chichen, confirm this
assertion.There we see figures of men and women painted blue, some
marching to the sacrifice with their hands tied behind their backs.After being thus painted they were venerated by the people, who regarded
them as sanctified.Blue in Egypt was always the color used at the
funerals.The Egyptians believed in the immortality of the soul; and that rewards
and punishments were adjudged by Osiris, the king of the Amenti, to the
souls according to their deeds during their mundane life.That the souls
after a period of three thousand years were to return to earth and
inhabit again their former earthly tenements.This was the reason why
they took so much pains to embalm the body.The Mayas also believed in the immortality of the soul, as I have
already said.Their belief was that after the spirit had suffered during
a time proportioned to their misdeeds whilst on earth, and after having
enjoyed an amount of bliss corresponding to their good actions, they
were to return to earth and live again a material life.Accordingly, as
the body was corruptible, they made statues of stones, terra-cotta, or
wood, in the semblance of the deceased, whose ashes they deposited in a
hollow made for that purpose in the back of the head.Sometimes also in
stone urns, as in the case of Chaacmol.The spirits, on their return to
earth, were to find these statues, impart life to them, and use them as
body during their new existence.I am not certain but that, as the Egyptians also, they were believers in
transmigration; and that this belief exists yet among the aborigines.I
have noticed that my Indians were unwilling to kill any animal whatever,
even the most noxious and dangerous, that inhabits the ruined monuments.I have often told them to kill some venomous insect or serpent that may
have happened to be in our way.They invariably refused to do so, but
softly and carefully caused them to go.And when asked why they did not
kill them, declined to answer except by a knowing and mysterious smile,
as if afraid to let a stranger into their intimate beliefs inherited
from their ancestors: remembering, perhaps, the fearful treatment
inflicted by fanatical friars on their fathers to oblige them to forego
what they called the superstitions of their race--the idolatrous creed
of their forefathers.I have had opportunity to discover that their faith in reincarnation, as
many other time-honored credences, still exists among them, unshaken,
notwithstanding the persecutions and tortures suffered by them at the
hands of ignorant and barbaric _Christians_ (?)I will give two instances when that belief in reincarnation was plainly
manifested.The day that, after surmounting many difficulties, when my ropes and
cables, made of withes and the bark of the _habin_ tree, were finished
and adjusted to the capstan manufactured of hollow stones and trunks of
trees; and I had placed the ponderous statue of Chaacmol on rollers,
already in position to drag it up the inclined plane made from the
surface of the ground to a few feet above the bottom of the excavation;
my men, actuated by their superstitious fears on the one hand, and
their profound reverence for the memory of their ancestors on the other,
unwilling to see the effigy of one of the great men removed from where
their ancestors had placed it in ages gone by resolved to bury it, by
letting loose the hill of dry stones that formed the body of the
mausoleum, and were kept from falling in the hole by a framework of thin
trunks of trees tied with withes, and in order that it should not be
injured, to capsize it, placing the face downward.They had already
overturned it, when I interfered in time to prevent more mischief, and
even save some of them from certain death; since by cutting loose the
withes that keep the framework together, the sides of the excavation
were bound to fall in, and crush those at the bottom.I honestly think,
knowing their superstitious feelings and propensities, that they had
made up their mind to sacrifice their lives, in order to avoid what they
considered a desecration of the future tenement that the great warrior
and king was yet to inhabit, when time had arrived.In order to overcome
their scruples, and also to prove if my suspicions were correct, that,
as their forefathers and the Egyptians of old, they still believed in
reincarnation, I caused them to accompany me to the summit of the great
pyramid.There is a monument, that served as a castle when the city of
the holy men, the Itzaes, was at the height of its splendor.Every anta,
every pillar and column of this edifice is sculptured with portraits of
warriors and noblemen.Among these many with long beards, whose types
recall vividly to the mind the features of the Afghans.On one of the antae, at the entrance on the north side, is the portrait
of a warrior wearing a long, straight, pointed beard.The face, like
that of all the personages represented in the bas-reliefs, is in
profile.I placed my head against the stone so as to present the same
position of my face as that of UXAN, and called the attention of my
Indians to the similarity of his and my own features.They followed
every lineament of the faces with their fingers to the very point of the
beard, and soon uttered an exclamation of astonishment: "_Thou!_
_here!_" and slowly scanned again the features sculptured on the stone
and my own."_So, so,_" they said, "_thou too art one of our great men, who has been
disenchanted.Thou, too, wert a companion of the great Lord Chaacmol.That is why thou didst know where he was hidden; and thou hast come to
disenchant him also.His time to live again on earth has then arrived._"

From that moment every word of mine was implicitly obeyed.They returned
to the excavation, and worked with such a good will, that they soon
brought up the ponderous statue to the surface.A few days later some strange people made their appearance suddenly and
noiselessly in our midst.They emerged from the thicket one by one.Colonel _Don_ Felipe Diaz, then commander of the troops covering the
eastern frontier, had sent me, a couple of days previous, a written
notice, that I still preserve in my power, that tracks of hostile
Indians had been discovered by his scouts, advising me to keep a sharp
look out, lest they should surprise us.Now, to be on the look out in
the midst of a thick, well-nigh impenetrable forest, is a rather
difficult thing to do, particularly with only a few men, and where there
is no road; yet all being a road for the enemy.Warning my men that
danger was near, and to keep their loaded rifles at hand, we continued
our work as usual, leaving the rest to destiny.On seeing the strangers, my men rushed on their weapons, but noticing
that the visitors had no guns, but only their _machetes_, I gave orders
not to hurt them.At their head was a very old man: his hair was gray,
his eyes blue with age.He would not come near the statue, but stood at
a distance as if awe-struck, hat in hand, looking at it.After a long
time he broke out, speaking to his own people: "This, boys, is one of
the great men we speak to you about."Then the young men came forward,
with great respect kneeled at the feet of the statue, and pressed their
lips against them.Putting aside my own weapons, being consequently unarmed, I went to the
old man, and asked him to accompany me up to the castle, offering my arm
to ascend the 100 steep and crumbling stairs.I again placed my face
near that of my stone _Sosis_, and again the same scene was enacted as
with my own men, with this difference, that the strangers fell on their
knees before me, and, in turn, kissed my hand.The old man after a
while, eyeing me respectfully, but steadily, asked me: "Rememberest thou
what happened to thee whilst thou wert enchanted?"It was quite a
difficult question to answer, and yet retain my superior position, for I
did not know how many people might be hidden in the thicket."Well,
father," I asked him, "dreamest thou sometimes?"He nodded his head in
an affirmative manner."And when thou awakest, dost thou remember
distinctly thy dreams?""Well, father," I
continued, "so it happened with me.I do not remember what took place
during the time I was enchanted."I
again gave him my hand to help him down the precipitous stairs, at the
foot of which we separated, wishing them God-speed, and warning them not
to go too near the villages on their way back to their homes, as people
were aware of their presence in the country.Whence they came, I ignore;
where they went, I don't know.Circumcision was a rite in usage among the Egyptians since very remote
times.The Mayas also practiced it, if we are to credit Fray Luis de
Urreta; yet Cogolludo affirms that in his days the Indians denied
observing such custom.The outward sign of utmost reverence seems to
have been identical amongst both the Mayas and the Egyptians.It
consisted in throwing the left arm across the chest, resting the left
hand on the right shoulder; or the right arm across the chest, the
right hand resting on the left shoulder.Sir Gardner Wilkinson, in his
work above quoted, reproduces various figures in that attitude; and Mr.Champollion Figeac, in his book on Egypt, tells us that in some cases
even the mummies of certain eminent men were placed in their coffins
with the arms in that position.That this same mark of respect was in
use amongst the Mayas there can be no possible doubt.We see it in the
figures represented in the act of worshiping the mastodon's head, on the
west facade of the monument that forms the north wing of the palace and
museum at Chichen-Itza.We see it repeatedly in the mural paintings in
Chaacmol's funeral chamber; on the slabs sculptured with the
representation of a dying warrior, that adorned the mausoleum of that
chieftain.Cogolludo mentions it in his history of Yucatan, as being
common among the aborigines: and my own men have used it to show their
utmost respect to persons or objects they consider worthy of their
veneration.Among my collection of photographs are several plates in
which some of the men have assumed that position of the arms
spontaneously._The sistrum_ was an instrument used by Egyptians and Mayas alike during
the performance of their religious rites and acts of worship.I have
seen it used lately by natives in Yucatan in the dance forming part of
the worship of the sun.The Egyptians enclosed the brains, entrails and
viscera of the deceased in funeral vases, called _canopas_, that were
placed in the tombs with the coffin.When I opened Chaacmol's mausoleum
I found, as I have already said, two stone urns, the one near the head
containing the remains of brains, that near the chest those of the heart
and other viscera.This fact would tend to show again a similar custom
among the Mayas and Egyptians, who, besides, placed with the body an
empty vase--symbol that the deceased had been judged and found
righteous.This vase, held between the hands of the statue of Chaacmol,
is also found held in the same manner by many other statues of
different individuals.It was customary with the Egyptians to deposit in
the tombs the implements of the trade or profession of the deceased.So
also with the Mayas--if a priest, they placed books; if a warrior, his
weapons; if a mechanic, the tools of his art,[TN-23]

The Egyptians adorned the tombs of the rich--which generally consisted
of one or two chambers--with sculptures and paintings reciting the names
and the history of the life of the personage to whom the tomb belonged.The mausoleum of Chaacmol, interiorly, was composed of three different
superposed apartments, with their floors of concrete well leveled,
polished and painted with yellow ochre; and exteriorly was adorned with
magnificent bas-reliefs, representing his totem and that of his
wife--dying warriors--the whole being surrounded by the image of a
feathered serpent--_Can_, his family name, whilst the walls of the two
apartments, or funeral chambers, in the monument raised to his memory,
were decorated with fresco paintings, representing not only Chaacmol's
own life, but the manners, customs, mode of dressing of his
contemporaries; as those of the different nations with which they were
in communication: distinctly recognizable by their type, stature and
other peculiarities.The portraits of the great and eminent men of his
time are sculptured on the jambs and lintels of the doors, represented
life-size.In Egypt it was customary to paint the sculptures, either on stone or
wood, with bright colors--yellow, blue, red, green predominating.In
Mayab the same custom prevailed, and traces of these colors are still
easily discernible on the sculptures; whilst they are still very
brilliant on the beautiful and highly polished stucco of the walls in
the rooms of certain monuments at Chichen-Itza.The Maya artists seem to
have used mostly vegetable colors; yet they also employed ochres as
pigments, and cinnabar--we having found such metallic colors in
Chaacmol's mausoleum.Le Plongeon still preserves some in her
possession.From where they procured it is more than we can tell at
present.The wives and daughters of the Egyptian kings and noblemen considered it
an honor to assist in the temples and religious ceremonies: one of their
principal duties being to play the sistrum.We find that in Yucatan, _Nicte_ (flower) the sister of _Chaacmol_,
assisted her elder brother, _Cay_, the pontiff, in the sanctuary, her
name being always associated with his in the inscriptions which adorn
the western facade of that edifice at Uxmal, as that of her sister,
_Mo_,[TN-24] is with Chaacmol's in some of the monuments at Chichen.Cogolludo, when speaking of the priestesses, _virgins of the sun_,
mentions a tradition that seems to refer to _Nicte_, stating that the
daughter of a king, who remained during all her life in the temple,
obtained after her death the honor of apotheosis, and was worshiped
under the name of _Zuhuy-Kak_ (the fire-virgin), and became the goddess
of the maidens, who were recommended to her care.As in Egypt, the kings and heroes were worshiped in Mayab after their
death; temples and pyramids being raised to their memory.Cogolludo
pretends that the lower classes adored fishes, snakes, tigers and other
abject animals, "even the devil himself, which appeared to them in
horrible forms" ("Historia de Yucatan," book IV., chap.Judging from the sculptures and mural paintings, the higher classes in
_Mayab_ wore, in very remote ages, dresses of quite an elaborate
character.Their under garment consisted of short trowsers, reaching the
middle of the thighs.At times these trowsers were highly ornamented
with embroideries and fringes, as they formed their only article of
clothing when at home; over these they wore a kind of kilt, very similar
to that used by the inhabitants of the Highlands in Scotland.It was
fastened to the waist with wide ribbons, tied behind in a knot forming a
large bow, the ends of which reached to the ankles.Their shoulders
were covered with a tippet falling to the elbows, and fastened on the
chest by means of a brooch.Their feet were protected by sandals, kept
in place by ropes or ribbons, passing between the big toe and the next,
and between the third and fourth, then brought up so as to encircle the
ankles.They were tied in front, forming a bow on the instep.Some wore
leggings, others garters and anklets made of feathers, generally yellow;
sometimes, however, they may have been of gold.Their head gears were of
different kinds, according to their rank and dignity.Warriors seem to
have used wide bands, tied behind the head with two knots, as we see in
the statue of Chaacmol, and in the bas-reliefs that adorn the queen's
chamber at Chichen.The king's coiffure was a peaked cap, that seems to
have served as model for the _pschent_, that symbol of domination over
the lower Egypt; with this difference, however, that in Mayab the point
formed the front, and in Egypt the back.The common people in Mayab, as in Egypt, were indeed little troubled by
their garments.These consisted merely of a simple girdle tied round the
loins, the ends falling before and behind to the middle of the thighs.Sometimes they also used the short trowsers; and, when at work, wrapped
a piece of cloth round their loins, long enough to cover their legs to
the knees.This costume was completed by wearing a square cloth, tied on
one of the shoulders by two of its corners.To-day
the natives of Yucatan wear the same dress, with but slight
modifications.While the aborigines of the _Tierra de Guerra_, who still
preserve the customs of their forefathers, untainted by foreign
admixture, use the same garments, of their own manufacture, that we see
represented in the bas-reliefs of Chichen and Uxmal, and in the mural
paintings of _Mayab_ and Egypt.Divination by the inspection of the entrails of victims, and the study
of omens were considered by the Egyptians as important branches of
learning.The soothsayers formed a respected order of the priesthood.From the mural paintings at Chichen, and from the works of the
chroniclers, we learn that the Mayas also had several manners of
consulting fate.One of the modes was by the inspection of the entrails
of victims; another by the manner of the cracking of the shell of a
turtle or armadillo by the action of fire, as among the Chinese.(In the
_Hong-fan_ or "the great and sublime doctrine," one of the books of the
_Chou-king_, the ceremonies of _Pou_ and _Chi_ are described at length).The Mayas had also their astrologers and prophets.Several prophecies,
purporting to have been made by their priests, concerning the preaching
of the Gospel among the people of Mayab, have reached us, preserved in
the works of Landa, Lizana, and Cogolludo.There we also read that, even
at the time of the Spanish conquest, they came from all parts of the
country, and congregated at the shrine of _Kinich-kakmo_, the deified
daughter of CAN, to listen to the oracles delivered by her through the
mouths of her priests and consult her on future events.By the
examination of the mural paintings, we know that _animal magnetism_ was
understood and practiced by the priests, who, themselves, seem to have
consulted clairvoyants.The learned priests of Egypt are said to have made considerable progress
in astronomical sciences.The _gnomon_, discovered by me in December, last year, in the ruined
city of Mayapan, would tend to prove that the learned men of Mayab were
not only close observers of the march of the celestial bodies and good
mathematicians; but that their attainments in astronomy were not
inferior to those of their brethren of Chaldea.Effectively the
construction of the gnomon shows that they had found the means of
calculating the latitude of places, that they knew the distance of the
solsticeal points from the equator; they had found that the greatest
angle of declination of the sun, 23 deg.27', occurred when that
luminary reached the tropics where, during nearly three days, said angle
of declination does not vary, for which reason they said that the _sun_
had arrived at his resting place.The Egyptians, it is said, in very remote ages, divided the year by
lunations, as the Mayas, who divided their civil year into eighteen
months, of twenty days, that they called U--moon--to which they added
five supplementary days, that they considered unlucky.From an epoch so
ancient that it is referred to the fabulous time of their history, the
Egyptians adopted the solar year, dividing it into twelve months, of
thirty days, to which they added, at the end of the last month, called
_Mesore_, five days, named _Epact_.By a most remarkable coincidence, the Egyptians, as the Mayas,
considered these additive five days _unlucky_.Besides this solar year they had a sideral or sothic year, composed of
365 days and 6 hours, which corresponds exactly to the Mayas[TN-25]
sacred year, that Landa tells us was also composed of 365 days and 6
hours; which they represented in the gnomon of Mayapan by the line that
joins the centers of the stela that forms it.The Egyptians, in their computations, calculated by a system of _fives_
and _tens_; the Mayas by a system of _fives_ and _twenties_, to four
hundred.Their sacred number appears to have been 13 from the remotest
antiquity, but SEVEN seems to have been a _mystic number_ among them as
among the Hindoos, Aryans, Chaldeans, Egyptians, and other nations.The Egyptians made use of a septenary system in the arrangement of the
grand gallery in the center of the great pyramid.Each side of the wall
is made of seven courses of finely polished stones, the one above
overlapping that below, thus forming the triangular ceiling common to
all the edifices in Yucatan.This gallery is said to be seven times the
height of the other passages, and, as all the rooms in Uxmal, Chichen
and other places in Mayab, it is seven-sided.Some authors pretend to
assume that this well marked septenary system has reference to the
_Pleiades_ or _Seven stars_._Alcyone_, the central star of the group,
being, it is said, on the same meridian as the pyramid, when it was
constructed, and _Alpha_ of Draconis, the then pole star, at its lower
culmination.Joseph A. Seiss and others pretend, the scientific
attainments required for the construction of such enduring monument
surpassed those of the learned men of Egypt, we must, of necessity,
believe that the architect who conceived the plan and carried out its
designs must have acquired his knowledge from an older people,
possessing greater learning than the priests of Memphis; unless we try
to persuade ourselves, as the reverend gentleman wishes us to, that the
great pyramid was built under the direct inspiration of the Almighty.Nearly all the monuments of Yucatan bear evidence that the Mayas had a
predilection for number SEVEN.Since we find that their artificial
mounds were composed of seven superposed platforms; that the city of
Uxmal contained seven of these mounds; that the north side of the palace
of King CAN was adorned with seven turrets; that the entwined serpents,
his totem, which adorn the east facade of the west wing of this
building, have seven rattles; that the head-dress of kings and queens
were adorned with seven blue feathers; in a word, that the number SEVEN
prevails in all places and in everything where Maya influence has
predominated.It is a FACT, and one that may not be altogether devoid of significance,
that this number SEVEN seems to have been the mystic number of many of
the nations of antiquity.It has even reached our times as such, being
used as symbol[TN-26] by several of the secret societies existing among
us.If we look back through the vista of ages to the dawn of civilized life
in the countries known as the _old world_, we find this number SEVEN
among the Asiatic nations as well as in Egypt and Mayab.Effectively, in
Babylon, the celebrated temple of _the seven lights_ was made of _seven_
stages or platforms.In the hierarchy of Mazdeism, the _seven marouts_,
or genii of the winds, the _seven amschaspands_; then among the Aryans
and their descendants, the _seven horses_ that drew the chariot of the
sun, the _seven apris_ or shape of the flame, the _seven rays_ of Agni,
the _seven manons_ or criators of the Vedas; among the Hebrews, the
_seven days_ of the creation, the _seven lamps_ of the ark and of
Zacharias's vision, the _seven branches_ of the golden candlestick, the
_seven days_ of the feast of the dedication of the temple of Solomon,
the _seven years_ of plenty, the _seven years_ of famine; in the
Christian dispensation, the _seven_ churches with the _seven_ angels at
their head, the _seven_ golden candlesticks, the _seven seals_ of the
book, the _seven_ trumpets of the angels, the _seven heads_ of the beast
that rose from the sea, the _seven vials_ full of the wrath of God, the
_seven_ last plagues of the Apocalypse; in the Greek mythology, the
_seven_ heads of the hydra, killed by Hercules, etc.The origin of the prevalence of that number SEVEN amongst all the
nations of earth, even the most remote from each other, has never been
satisfactorily explained, each separate people giving it a different
interpretation, according to their belief and to the tenets of their
religious creeds.As far as the Mayas are concerned, I think to have
found that it originated with the _seven_ members of CAN'S family, who
were the founders of the principal cities of _Mayab_, and to each of
whom was dedicated a mound in Uxmal and a turret in their palace.Their
names, according to the inscriptions carved on the monuments raised by
them at Uxmal and Chichen, were--CAN (serpent) and [C]OZ (bat), his
wife, from whom were born CAY (fish), the pontiff; AAK (turtle), who
became the governor of Uxmal; CHAACMOL (leopard), the warrior, who
became the husband of his sister MOO (macaw), the Queen of _Chichen_,
worshiped after her death at Izamal; and NICTE (flower), the priestess
who, under the name of _Zuhuy-Kuk_, became the goddess of the maidens.The Egyptians, in expressing their ideas in writing, used three
different kinds of characters--phonetic, ideographic and
symbolic--placed either in vertical columns or in horizontal lines, to
be read from right to left, from left to right, as indicated by the
position of the figures of men or animals.So, also, the Mayas in their
writings employed phonetic, symbolic and ideographic signs, combining
these often, forming monograms as we do to-day, placing them in such a
manner as best suited the arrangement of the ornamentation of the facade
of the edifices.At present we can only speak with certainty of the
monumental inscriptions, the books that fell in the hands of the
ecclesiastics at the time of the conquest having been destroyed.No
truly genuine written monuments of the Mayas are known to exist, except
those inclosed within the sealed apartments, where the priests and
learned men of MAYAB hid them from the _Nahualt_ or _Toltec_ invaders.As the Egyptians, they wrote in vertical columns and horizontal lines,
to be read generally from right to left.The space of this small essay
does not allow me to enter in more details; they belong naturally to a
work of different nature.Let it therefore suffice, for the present
purpose, to state that the comparative study of the language of the
Mayas led us to suspect that, as it contains words belonging to nearly
all the known languages of antiquity, and with exactly the same meaning,
in their mode of writing might be found letters or characters or signs
used in those tongues.Studying with attention the photographs made by
us of the inscriptions of Uxmal and Chichen, we were not long in
discovering that our surmises were indeed correct.The inscriptions,
written in squares or parallelograms, that might well have served as
models for the ancient hieratic Chaldeans, of the time of King Uruck,
seem to contain ancient Chaldee, Egyptian and Etruscan characters,
together with others that seem to be purely Mayab.Applying these known characters to the decipherment of the inscriptions,
giving them their accepted value, we soon found that the language in
which they are written is, in the main, the vernacular of the aborigines
of Yucatan and other parts of Central America to-day.Of course, the
original mother tongue having suffered some alterations, in consequence
of changes in customs induced by time, invasions, intercourse with other
nations, and the many other natural causes that are known to affect
man's speech.The Mayas and the Egyptians had many signs and characters identical;
possessing the same alphabetical and symbolical value in both nations.Among the symbolical, I may cite a few: _water_, _country or region_,
_king_, _Lord_, _offerings_, _splendor_, the _various emblems of the
sun_ and many others.Among the alphabetical, a very large number of the
so-called Demotic, by Egyptologists, are found even in the inscription
of the _Akab[c]ib_ at Chichen; and not a few of the most ancient
Egyptian hieroglyphs in the mural inscriptions at Uxmal.In these I have
been able to discover the Egyptian characters corresponding to our own.A a, B, C, CH or K, D, T, I, L, M, N, H, P, TZ, PP, U, OO, X, having the
same sound and value as in the Spanish language, with the exception of
the K, TZ, PP and X, which are pronounced in a way peculiar to the
Mayas.The inscriptions also contain these letters, A, I, X and PP
identical to the corresponding in the Etruscan alphabet.The finding of
the value of these characters has enabled me to decipher, among other
things, the names of the founders of the city of UXMAL; as that of the
city itself.This is written apparently in two different ways: whilst,
in fact, the sculptors have simply made use of two homophone signs,
notwithstanding dissimilar, of the letter M. As to the name of the
founders, not only are they written in alphabetical characters, but also
in ideographic, since they are accompanied in many instances by the
totems of the personages: e. g[TN-27] for AAK, which means turtle, is the
image of a turtle; for CAY (fish), the image of a fish; for Chaacmol
(leopard) the image of a leopard; and so on, precluding the possibility
of misinterpretation.Having found that the language of the inscriptions was Maya, of course
I had no difficulty in giving to each letter its proper phonetic value,
since, as I have already said, Maya is still the vernacular of the
people.I consider that the few facts brought together will suffice at present
to show, if nothing else, a strange similarity in the workings of the
mind in these two nations.But if these remarkable coincidences are not
merely freaks of hazard, we will be compelled to admit that one people
must have learned it from the other.Then will naturally arise the
questions, Which the teacher?The answer will not only
solve an ethnological problem, but decide the question of priority.I will now briefly refer to the myth of Osiris, the son of _Seb and
Nut_, the brother of _Aroeris_, the elder _Horus_, of _Typho_, of
_Isis_, and of _Nephthis_, named also NIKE.The authors have given
numerous explanations, result of fancy; of the mythological history of
that god, famous throughout Egypt.They made him a personification of
the inundations of the NILE; ISIS, his wife and sister, that of the
irrigated portion of the land of Egypt; their sister, _Nephthis_, that
of the barren edge of the desert occasionally fertilized by the waters
of the Nile; his brother and murderer _Tipho_, that of the sea which
swallows up the _Nile_.Leaving aside the mythical lores, with which the priests of all times
and all countries cajole the credulity of ignorant and superstitious
people, we find that among the traditions of the past, treasured in the
mysterious recesses of the temples, is a history of the life of Osiris
on Earth.Many wise men of our days have looked upon it as fabulous.I
am not ready to say whether it is or it is not; but this I can assert,
that, in many parts, it tallies marvelously with that of the culture
hero of the Mayas.It will be said, no doubt, that this remarkable similarity is a mere
coincidence.But how are we to dispose of so many coincidences?What
conclusion, if any, are we to draw from this concourse of so many
strange similes?In this case, I cannot do better than to quote, verbatim, from Sir
Gardner Wilkinson's work, chap.xiii:

     "_Osiris_, having become King of Egypt, applied himself towards
     civilizing his countrymen, by turning them from their former
     barbarous course of life, teaching them, moreover, to cultivate and
     improve the fruits of the earth.* * * * * With the same good
     disposition, he afterwards traveled over the rest of the world,
     inducing the people everywhere to submit to his discipline, by the
     mildest persuasion."The rest of the story relates to the manner of his killing by his
brother Typho, the disposal of his remains, the search instituted by his
wife to recover the body, how it was stolen again from her by _Typho_,
who cut him to pieces, scattering them over the earth, of the final
defeat of Typho by Osiris's son, Horus.Reading the description, above quoted, of the endeavors of Osiris to
civilize the world, who would not imagine to be perusing the traditions
of the deeds of the culture heroes _Kukulean_[TN-28] and Quetzalcoatl of
the Mayas and of the Aztecs?Osiris was particularly worshiped at Philo,
where the history of his life is curiously illustrated in the sculptures
of a small retired chamber, lying nearly over the western adytum of the
temple, just as that of Chaacmol in the mural paintings of his funeral
chamber, the bas-reliefs of what once was his mausoleum, in those of the
queen's chamber and of her box in the tennis court at Chichen."The mysteries of Osiris were divided into the greater and less
     mysteries.Before admission into the former, it was necessary that
     the initiated should have passed through all the gradations of the
     latter.But to merit this great honor, much was expected of the
     candidate, and many even of the priesthood were unable to obtain
     it.Besides the proofs of a virtuous life, other recommendations
     were required, and to be admitted to all the grades of the higher
     mysteries was the greatest honor to which any one could aspire.It
     was from these that the mysteries of Eleusis were borrowed."In Mayab there also existed mysteries, as proved by symbols discovered
in the month of June last by myself in the monument generally called the
_Dwarf's House_, at Uxmal.It seemed that the initiated had to pass
through different gradations to reach the highest or third; if we are to
judge by the number of rooms dedicated to their performance, and the
disposition of said rooms.The strangest part, perhaps, of this
discovery is the information it gives us that certain signs and symbols
were used by the affiliated, that are perfectly identical to those used
among the masons in their symbolical lodges.I have lately published in
_Harper's Weekly_, a full description of the building, with plans of the
same, and drawings of the signs and symbols existing in it.These secret
societies exist still among the _Zunis_ and other Pueblo Indians of New
Mexico, according to the relations of Mr.Frank H. Cushing, a gentleman
sent by the Smithsonian Institution to investigate their customs and
history.In order to comply with the mission intrusted to him, Mr.Cushing has caused his adoption in the tribe of the Zunis, whose
language he has learned, whose habits he has adopted.Among the other
remarkable things he has discovered is "the existence of twelve sacred
orders, with their priests and their secret rites as carefully guarded
as the secrets of freemasonry, an institution to which these orders have
a strange resemblance."If from Egypt we pass to Nubia, we find that the peculiar battle ax of
the Mayas was also used by the warriors of that country; whilst many of
the customs of the inhabitants of equatorial Africa, as described by Mr.DuChaillu[TN-29] in the relation of his voyage to the "Land of Ashango,"
so closely resemble those of the aborigines of Yucatan as to suggest
that intimate relations must have existed, in very remote ages, between
their ancestors; if the admixture of African blood, clearly discernible
still, among the natives of certain districts of the peninsula, did not
place that _fact_ without the peradventure of a doubt.We also see
figures in the mural paintings, at Chichen, with strongly marked African
features.We learned by the discovery of the statue of Chaacmol, and that of the
priestess found by me at the foot of the altar in front of the shrine
of _Ix-cuina_, the Maya Venus, situated at the south end of _Isla
Mugeres_, it was customary with persons of high rank to file their teeth
in sharp points like a saw.We read in the chronicles that this fashion
still prevailed after the Spanish conquest; and then by little and
little fell into disuse.Travelers tells us that it is yet in vogue
among many of the tribes in the interior of South America; particularly
those whose names seem to connect with the ancient Caribs or Carians.Du Chaillu asserts that the Ashangos, those of Otamo, the Apossos, the
Fans, and many other tribes of equatorial Africa, consider it a mark of
beauty to file their front teeth in a sharp point.He presents the Fans
as confirmed cannibals.We are told, and the bas-reliefs on Chaacmol's
mausoleum prove it, that the Mayas devoured the hearts of their fallen
enemies.It is said that, on certain grand occasions, after offering the
hearts of their victims to the idols, they abandoned the bodies to the
people, who feasted upon them.But it must be noticed that these
last-mentioned customs seemed to have been introduced in the country by
the Nahualts and Aztecs; since, as yet, we have found nothing in the
mural paintings to cause us to believe that the Mayas indulged in such
barbaric repasts, beyond the eating of their enemies' hearts.The Mayas were, and their descendants are still, confirmed believers in
witchcraft.In December, last year, being at the hacienda of
X-Kanchacan, where are situated the ruins of the ancient city of
Mayapan, a sick man was brought to me.He came most reluctantly, stating
that he knew what was the matter with him: that he was doomed to die
unless the spell was removed.He was emaciated, seemed to suffer from
malarial fever, then prevalent in the place, and from the presence of
tapeworm.I told him I could restore him to health if he would heed my
advice.The fellow stared at me for some time, trying to find out,
probably, if I was a stronger wizard than the _H-Men_ who had bewitched
him.He must have failed to discover on my face the proverbial
distinctive marks great sorcerers are said to possess; for, with an
incredulous grin, stretching his thin lips tighter over his teeth, he
simply replied: "No use--I am bewitched--there is no remedy for me."Du Chaillu, speaking of the superstitions of the inhabitants of
Equatorial Africa, says: "The greatest curse of the whole country is the
belief in sorcery or witchcraft.If the African is once possessed with
the belief that he is bewitched his whole nature seems to change.He
becomes suspicious of his dearest friends.He fancies himself sick, and
really often becomes sick through his fears.At least seventy-five per
cent of the deaths in all the tribes are murders for supposed sorcery."In that they differ from the natives of Yucatan, who respect wizards
because of their supposed supernatural powers.From the most remote antiquity, as we learn from the writings of the
chroniclers, in all sacred ceremonies the Mayas used to make copious
libations with _Balche_.To-day the aborigines still use it in the
celebrations of their ancient rites._Balche_ is a liquor made from the
bark of a tree called Balche, soaked in water, mixed with honey and left
to ferment.The nectar drank by
the God of Greek Mythology.Du Chaillu, speaking of the recovery to health of the King of _Mayo_lo,
a city in which he resided for some time, says: "Next day he was so much
elated with the improvement in his health that he got tipsy on a
fermented beverage which he had prepared two days before he had fallen
ill, and which he made by _mixing honey and water, and adding to it
pieces of bark of a certain tree_."(Journey to Ashango Land, page 183.)I will remark here that, by a strange _coincidence_, we not only find
that the inhabitants of Equatorial Africa have customs identical with
the MAYAS, but that the name of one of their cities MAYO_lo_, seems to
be a corruption of MAYAB.The Africans make offerings upon the graves of their departed friends,
where they deposit furniture, dress and food--and sometimes slay slaves,
men and women, over the graves of kings and chieftains, with the belief
that their spirits join that of him in whose honor they have been
sacrificed.I have already said that it was customary with the Mayas to place in the
tombs part of the riches of the deceased and the implements of his trade
or profession; and that the great quantity of blood found scattered
round the slab on which the statue of Chaacmol is reclining would tend
to suggest that slaves were sacrificed at his funeral.The Mayas of old were wont to abandon the house where a person had died.Many still observe that same custom when they can afford to do so; for
they believe that the spirit of the departed hovers round it.The Africans also abandon their houses, remove even the site of their
villages when death frequently occur;[TN-30] for, say they, the place is
no longer good; and they fear the spirits of those recently deceased.Among the musical instruments used by the Mayas there were two kinds of
drums--the _Tunkul_ and the _Zacatan_.They are still used by the
aborigines in their religious festivals and dances.The _Tunkul_ is a cylinder hollowed from the trunk of a tree, so as to
leave it about one inch in thickness all round.It is generally about
four feet in length.On one side two slits are cut, so as to leave
between them a strip of about four inches in width, to within six inches
from the ends; this strip is divided in the middle, across, so as to
form, as it were, tongues.It is by striking on those tongues with two
balls of india-rubber, attached to the end of sticks, that the
instrument is played.The volume of sound produced is so great that it
can be heard, is[TN-31] is said, at a distance of six miles in calm
weather.The _Zacatan_ is another sort of drum, also hollowed from the
trunk of a tree.On one end a piece of
skin is tightly stretched.It is by beating on the skin with the hand,
the instrument being supported between the legs of the drummer, in a
slanting position, that it is played.Du Chaillu, Stanley and other travelers in Africa tell us that, in case
of danger and to call the clans together, the big war drum is beaten,
and is heard many miles around.Du Chaillu asserts having seen one of
these _Ngoma_, formed of a hollow log, nine feet long, at Apono; and
describes a _Fan_ drum which corresponds to the _Zacatan_ of the Mayas
as follows: "The cylinder was about four feet long and ten inches in
diameter at one end, but only seven at the other.The wood was hollowed
out quite thin, and the skin stretched over tightly.To beat it the
drummer held it slantingly between his legs, and with two sticks
beats[TN-32] furiously upon the upper, which was the larger end of the
cylinder."We have the counterpart of the fetish houses, containing the skulls of
the ancestors and some idol or other, seen by Du Chaillu, in African
towns, in the small huts constructed at the entrance of all the villages
in Yucatan.These huts or shrines contain invariably a crucifix; at
times the image of some saint, often a skull.The last probably to cause
the wayfarer to remember he has to die; and that, as he cannot carry
with him his worldly treasures on the other side of the grave, he had
better deposit some in the alms box firmly fastened at the foot of the
cross.Cogolludo informs us these little shrines were anciently
dedicated to the god of lovers, of histrions, of dancers, and an
infinity of small idols that were placed at the entrance of the
villages, roads and staircases of the temples and other parts.Even the breed of African dogs seems to be the same as that of the
native dogs of Yucatan.Were I to describe these I could not make use of
more appropriate words than the following of Du Chaillu: "The pure bred
native dog is small, has long straight ears, long muzzle and long curly
tail; the hair is short and the color yellowish; the pure breed being
known by the clearness of his color.They are always lean, and are kept
very short of food by their owners.* * * Although they have quick ears;
I don't think highly of their scent.I could continue this list of similes, but methinks those already
mentioned as sufficient for the present purpose.I will therefore close
it by mentioning this strange belief that Du Chaillu asserts exists
among the African warriors: "_The charmed leopard's skin worn about the
warrior's middle is supposed to render that worthy spear-proof._"

Let us now take a brief retrospective glance at the FACTS mentioned in
the foregoing pages.They seem to teach us that, in ages so remote as to
be well nigh lost in the abyss of the past, the _Mayas_ were a great and
powerful nation, whose people had reached a high degree of civilization.That it is impossible for us to form a correct idea of their
attainments, since only the most enduring monuments, built by them, have
reached us, resisting the disintegrating action of time and atmosphere.That, as the English of to-day, they had colonies all over the earth;
for we find their name, their traditions, their customs and their
language scattered in many distant countries, among whose inhabitants
they apparently exercised considerable civilizing influence, since they
gave names to their gods, to their tribes, to their cities.We cannot doubt that the colonists carried with them the old traditions
of the mother country, and the history of the founders of their
nationality; since we find them in the countries where they seem to have
established large settlements soon after leaving the land of their
birth.In course of time these traditions have become disfigured,
wrapped, as it were, in myths, creations of fanciful and untutored
imaginations, as in Hindostan: or devises of crafty priests, striving to
hide the truth from the ignorant mass of the people, fostering their
superstitions, in order to preserve unbounded and undisputed sway over
them, as in Egypt.In Hindostan, for example, we find the Maya custom of carrying the
children astride on the hips of the nurses.That of recording the vow of
the devotees, or of imploring the blessings of deity by the imprint of
the hand, dipped in red liquid, stamped on the walls of the shrines and
palaces.The worship of the mastodon, still extant in India, Siam,
Burmah, as in the worship of _Ganeza_, the god of knowledge, with an
elephant head, degenerated in that of the elephant itself.Still extant we find likewise the innate propensity of the Mayas to
exclude all foreigners from their country; even to put to death those
who enter their territories (as do, even to-day, those of Santa Cruz and
the inhabitants of the Tierra de Guerra) as the emissaries of Rama were
informed by the friend of the owner of the country, the widow of the
_great architect_, MAYA, whose name HEMA means in the Maya language "she
who places ropes across the roads to impede the passage."Even the
history of the death of her husband MAYA, killed with a thunderbolt, by
the god _Pourandara_, whose jealousy was aroused by his love for her and
their marriage, recalls that of _Chaacmol_, the husband of _Moo_, killed
by their brother Aac, by being stabbed by him three times in the back
with a spear, through jealousy--for he also loved _Moo_.Some Maya tribes, after a time, probably left their home at the South of
Hindostan and emigrated to Afghanistan, where their descendants still
live and have villages on the North banks of the river _Kabul_.They
left behind old traditions, that they may have considered as mere
fantasies of their poets, and other customs of their forefathers.Yet we
know so little about the ancient Afghans, or the Maya tribes living
among them, that it is impossible at present to say how much, if any,
they have preserved of the traditions of their race.All we know for a
certainty is that many of the names of their villages and tribes are
pure American-Maya words: that their types are very similar to the
features of the bearded men carved on the pillars of the castle, and on
the walls of other edifices at Chichen-Itza: while their warlike habits
recall those of the Mayas, who fought so bravely and tenaciously the
Spanish invaders.Some of the Maya tribes, traveling towards the west and northwest,
reached probably the shores of Ethiopia; while others, entering the
Persian Gulf, landed near the embouchure of the Euphrates, and founded
their primitive capital at a short distance from it.They called it _Hur
(Hula) city of guests just arrived_--and according to Berosus gave
themselves the name of _Khaldi_; probably because they intrenched their
city: _Kal_ meaning intrenchment in the American-Maya language.We have
seen that the names of all the principal deities of the primitive
Chaldeans had a natural etymology in that tongue.Such strange
coincidences cannot be said to be altogether accidental.Particularly
when we consider that their learned men were designated as MAGI, (Mayas)
and their Chief _Rab-Mag_, meaning, in Maya, the _old man_; and were
great architects, mathematicians and astronomers.As again we know of
them but imperfectly, we cannot tell what traditions they had preserved
of the birthplace of their forefathers.But by the inscriptions on the
tablets or bricks, found at Mugheir and Warka, we know for a certainty
that, in the archaic writings, they formed their characters of straight
lines of uniform thickness; and inclosed their sentences in squares or
parallelograms, as did the founders of the ruined cities of Yucatan.And
from the signet cylinder of King Urukh, that their mode of dressing was
identical with that of many personages represented in the mural
paintings at Chichen-Itza.We have traced the MAYAS again on the shores of Asia Minor, where the
CARIANS at last established themselves, after having spread terror among
the populations bordering on the Mediterranean.Their origin is unknown:
but their customs were so similar to those of the inhabitants of Yucatan
at the time even of the Spanish conquest--and their names CAR, _Carib_
or _Carians_, so extensively spread over the western continent, that we
might well surmise, that, navigators as they were, they came from those
parts of the world; particularly when we are told by the Greek poets and
historians, that the goddess MAIA was the daughter of _Atlantis_.We
have seen that the names of the khati, those of their cities, that of
Tyre, and finally that of Egypt, have their etymology in the Maya.Considering the numerous coincidences already pointed out, and many more
I could bring forth, between the attainments and customs of the Mayas
and the Egyptians; in view also of the fact that the priests and learned
men of Egypt constantly pointed toward the WEST as the birthplace of
their ancestors, it would seem as if a colony, starting from Mayab, had
emigrated Eastward, and settled on the banks of the Nile; just as the
Chinese to-day, quitting their native land and traveling toward the
rising sun, establish themselves in America.In Egypt again, as in Hindostan, we find the history of the children of
CAN, preserved among the secret traditions treasured up by the priests
in the dark recesses of their temples: the same story, even with all its
details.It is TYPHO who kills his brother OSIRIS, the husband of their
sister ISIS.Some of the names only have been changed when the members
of the royal family of CAN, the founder of the cities of Mayab, reaching
apotheosis, were presented to the people as gods, to be worshiped.That the story of _Isis_ and _Osiris_ is a mythical account of CHAACMOL
and MOO, from all the circumstances connected with it, according to the
relations of the priests of Egypt that tally so closely with what we
learn in Chichen-Itza from the bas-reliefs, it seems impossible to
doubt.Effectively, _Osiris_ and _Isis_ are considered as king and queen of the
Amenti--the region of the West--the mansion of the dead, of the
ancestors.Whatever may be the etymology of the name of Osiris, it is a
_fact_, that in the sculptures he is often represented with a spotted
skin suspended near him, and Diodorus Siculus says: "That the skin is
usually represented without the head; but some instances where this is
introduced show it to be the _leopard's_ or _panther's_."Again, the
name of Osiris as king of the West, of the Amenti, is always written, in
hieroglyphic characters, representing a crouching _leopard_ with an eye
above it.It is also well known that the priests of Osiris wore a
_leopard_ skin as their ceremonial dress.Now, Chaacmol reigned with his sister Moo, at Chichen-Itza, in Mayab, in
the land of the West for Egypt.The name _Chaacmol_ means, in Maya, a
_Spotted_ tiger, a _leopard_; and he is represented as such in all his
totems in the sculptures on the monuments; his shield being made of the
skin of leopard, as seen in the mural paintings.Osiris, in Egypt, is a myth.Chaacmol, in Mayab, a reality.A warrior
whose mausoleum I have opened; whose weapons and ornaments of jade are
in Mrs.Le Plongeon's possession; whose heart I have found, and sent a
piece of it to be analysed by professor Thompson of Worcester, Mass.;
whose effigy, with his name inscribed on the tablets occupying the place
of the ears, forms now one of the most precious relics in the National
Museum of Mexico.As to the etymology of her name
the Maya affords it in I[C]IN--_the younger sister_.As Queen of the
Amenti, of the West, she also is represented in hieroglyphs by the same
characters as her husband--a _leopard, with an eye above_, and the sign
of the feminine gender an oval or egg.But as a goddess she is always
portrayed with wings; the vulture being dedicated to her; and, as it
were, her totem.MOO the wife and sister of _Chaacmol_ was the Queen of Chichen.She is
represented on the Mausoleum of Chaacmol as a _Macaw_ (Moo in the Maya
language); also on the monuments at Uxmal: and the chroniclers tell us
that she was worshiped in Izamal under the name of _Kinich-Kakmo_;
reading from right to left the _fiery macaw with eyes like the sun_.Their protecting spirit is a _Serpent_, the totem of their father CAN.Another Egyptian divinity, _Apap_ or _Apop_, is represented under the
form of a gigantic serpent covered with wounds.Plutarch in his
treatise, _De Iside et Osiride_, tells us that he was enemy to the sun.TYPHO was the brother of Osiris and Isis; for jealousy, and to usurp the
throne, he formed a conspiration and killed his brother.He is said to
represent in the Egyptian mythology, the sea, by some; by others, _the
sun_.AAK (turtle) was also the brother of Chaacmol and _Moo_.For jealousy,
and to usurp the throne, he killed his brother at treason with three
thrusts of his _spear_ in the back.Around the belt of his statue at
Uxmal used to be seen hanging the heads of his brothers CAY and
CHAACMOL, together with that of MOO; whilst his feet rested on their
flayed bodies.In the sculpture he is pictured surrounded by the _Sun_
as his protecting spirit.The escutcheon of Uxmal shows that he called
the place he governed the land of the Sun.In the bas-reliefs of the
Queen's chamber at Chichen his followers are seen to render homage to
the _Sun_; others, the friends of MOO, to the _Serpent_.So, in Mayab as
in Egypt, the _Sun_ and _Serpent_ were inimical.In Egypt again this
enmity was a myth, in Mayab a reality.AROERIS was the brother of Osiris, Isis and Typho.His business seems to
have been that of a peace-maker.CAY was also the brother of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_ and _Aac_.He was the high
pontiff, and sided with Chaacmol and Moo in their troubles, as we learn
from the mural paintings, from his head and flayed body serving as
trophy to Aac as I have just said.In June last, among the ruins of _Uxmal_, I discovered a magnificent
bust of this personage; and I believe I know the place where his remains
are concealed.NEPHTHIS was the sister of Isis, Osiris, Typho, and Aroeris, and the
wife of Typho; but being in love with Osiris she managed to be taken to
his embraces, and she became pregnant.That intrigue having been
discovered by Isis, she adopted the child that Nephthis, fearing the
anger of her husband, had hidden, brought him up as her own under the
name of Anubis.Nephthis was also called NIKE by some.NIC or NICTE was the sister of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_, _Aac_, and _Cay_, with
whose name I find always her name associated in the sculptures on the
monuments.Here the analogy between these personages would seem to
differ, still further study of the inscriptions may yet prove the
Egyptian version to contain some truth._Nic_ or _Nicte_[TN-33] means
flower; a cast of her face, with a flower sculptured on one cheek,
exists among my collections.We are told that three children were born to Isis and Osiris: Horus,
Macedo, and Harpocrates.Well, in the scene painted on the walls of
Chaacmol's funeral chamber, in which the body of this warrior is
represented stretched on the ground, cut open under the ribs for the
extraction of the heart and visceras, he is seen surrounded by his wife,
his sister NIC, his mother _Zo[c]_, and four children.I will close these similes by mentioning that _Thoth_ was reputed the
preceptor of Isis; and said to be the inventor of letters, of the art of
reckoning, geometry, astronomy, and is represented in the hieroglyphs
under the form of a baboon (cynocephalus).He is one of the most ancient
divinities among the Egyptians.He had also the office of scribe in the
lower regions, where he was engaged in noting down the actions of the
dead, and presenting or reading them to Osiris.One of the modes of
writing his name in hieroglyphs, transcribed in our common letters,
reads _Nukta_; a word most appropriate and suggestive of his attributes,
since, according to the Maya language, it would signify to understand,
to perceive, _Nuctah_: while his name Thoth, maya[TN-34] _thot_ means to
scatter flowers; hence knowledge.In the temple of death at Uxmal, at
the foot of the grand staircase that led to the sanctuary, at the top of
which I found a sacrificial altar, there were six cynocephali in a
sitting posture, as Thoth is represented by the Egyptians.They were
placed three in a row each side of the stairs.Between them was a
platform where a skeleton, in a kneeling posture, used to be.To-day the
cynocephali have been removed.They are in one of the yard[TN-35] of the
principal house at the Hacienda of Uxmal.The statue representing the
kneeling skeleton lays, much defaced, where it stood when that ancient
city was in its glory.In the mural paintings at Chichen-Itza, we again find the baboon
(Cynocephalus) warning Moo of impending danger.She is pictured in her
home, which is situated in the midst of a garden, and over which is seen
the royal insignia.A basket, painted blue, full of bright oranges, is
symbolical of her domestic happiness.Before
her is an individual pictured physically deformed, to show the ugliness
of his character and by the flatness of his skull, want of moral
qualities, (the[TN-36] proving that the learned men of Mayab understood
phrenology).He is in an persuasive attitude; for he has come to try to
seduce her in the name of another.She rejects his offer: and, with her
extended hand, protects the armadillo, on whose shell the high priest
read her destiny when yet a child.In a tree, just above the head of the
man, is an ape.His hand is open and outstretched, both in a warning and
threatening position.A serpent (_can_), her protecting spirit, is seen
at a short distance coiled, ready to spring in her defense.Near by is
another serpent, entwined round the trunk of a tree.He has wounded
about the head another animal, that, with its mouth open, its tongue
protruding, looks at its enemy over its shoulder.Blood is seen oozing
from its tongue and face.This picture forcibly recalls to the mind the
myth of the garden of Eden.For here we have the garden, the fruit, the
woman, the tempter.As to the charmed _leopard_ skin worn by the African warriors to render
them invulnerable to spears, it would seem as if the manner in which
Chaacmol met his death, by being stabbed with a spear, had been known
to their ancestors; and that they, in their superstitious fancies, had
imagined that by wearing his totem, it would save them from being
wounded with the same kind of weapon used in killing him.Let us not
laugh at such a singular conceit among uncivilized tribes, for it still
prevails in Europe.On many of the French and German soldiers, killed
during the last German war, were found talismans composed of strips of
paper, parchment or cloth, on which were written supposed cabalistic
words or the name of some saint, that the wearer firmly believed to be
possessed of the power of making him invulnerable.I am acquainted with many people--and not ignorant--who believe that by
wearing on their persons rosaries, made in Jerusalem and blessed by the
Pope, they enjoy immunity from thunderbolts, plagues, epidemics and
other misfortunes to which human flesh is heir.That the Mayas were a race autochthon on this western continent and did
not receive their civilization from Asia or Africa, seems a rational
conclusion, to be deduced from the foregoing FACTS.If we had nothing
but their _name_ to prove it, it should be sufficient, since its
etymology is only to be found in the American Maya language.They cannot be said to have been natives of Hindostan; since we are told
that, in very remote ages, _Maya_, a prince of the Davanas, established
himself there.We do not find the etymology of his name in any book
where mention is made of it.We are merely told that he was a wise
magician, a great architect, a learned astronomer, a powerful Asoura
(demon), thirsting for battles and bloodshed: or, according to the
Sanscrit, a Goddess, the mother of all beings that exist--gods and men.Very little is known of the Mayas of Afghanistan, except that they call
themselves _Mayas_, and that the names of their tribes and cities are
words belonging to the American Maya language.Who can give the etymology of the name _Magi_, the learned men amongst
the Chaldees.We only know that its meaning is the same as _Maya_ in
Hindostan: magician, astronomer, learned man.If we come to Greece,
where we find again the name _Maia_, it is mentioned as that of a
goddess, as in Hindostan, the mother of the gods: only we are told that
she was the daughter of Atlantis--born of Atlantis.But if we come to
the lands beyond the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, then we find a
country called MAYAB, on account of the porosity of its soil; that, as a
sieve (_Mayab_), absorbs the water in an incredibly short time.Its
inhabitants took its name from that of the country, and called
themselves _Mayas_.It is a fact worthy of notice, that in their
hieroglyphic writings the sign employed by the Egyptians to signify a
_Lord_, a _Master_, was the image of a sieve.Would not this seem to
indicate that the western invaders who subdued the primitive inhabitants
of the valley of the Nile, and became the lords and masters of the land,
were people from MAYAB; particularly if we consider that the usual
character used to write the name of Egypt was the sieve, together with
the sign of land?We know that the _Mayas_ deified and paid divine honors to their eminent
men and women after their death.This worship of their heroes they
undoubtedly carried, with other customs, to the countries where they
emigrated; and, in due course of time, established it among their
inhabitants, who came to forget that MAYAB was a locality, converted it
in to a personalty: and as some of their gods came from it, Maya was
considered as the _Mother of the Gods_, as we see in Hindostan and
Greece.It would seem probable that the Mayas did not receive their civilization
from the inhabitants of the Asiatic peninsulas, for the religious lores
and customs they have in common are too few to justify this assertion.They would simply tend to prove that relations had existed between them
at some epoch or other; and had interchanged some of their habits and
beliefs as it happens, between the civilized nations of our days.This
appears to be the true side of the question; for in the figures
sculptured on the obelisks of Copan the Asiatic type is plainly
discernible; whilst the features of the statues that adorn the
celebrated temples of Hindostan are, beyond all doubts, American.The FACTS gathered from the monuments do not sustain the theory advanced
by many, that the inhabitants of tropical America received their
civilization from Egypt and Asia Minor.It is true that
I have shown that many of the customs and attainments of the Egyptians
were identical to those of the Mayas; but these had many religious rites
and habits unknown to the Egyptians; who, as we know, always pointed
towards the West as the birthplaces of their ancestors, and worshiped as
gods and goddesses personages who had lived, and whose remains are still
in MAYAB.Besides, the monuments themselves prove the respective
antiquity of the two nations.According to the best authorities the most ancient monuments raised by
the Egyptians do not date further back than about 2,500 years B. C.
Well, in Ake, a city about twenty-five miles from Merida, there exists
still a monument sustaining thirty-six columns of _katuns_.Each of
these columns indicate a lapse of one hundred and sixty years in the
life of the nation.They then would show that 5,760 years has intervened
between the time when the first stone was placed on the east corner of
the uppermost of the three immense superposed platforms that compose the
structure, and the placing of the last capping stone on the top of the
thirty-sixth column.How long did that event occur before the Spanish
conquest it is impossible to surmise.Supposing, however, it did take
place at that time; this would give us a lapse of at least 6,100 years
since, among the rejoicings of the people this sacred monument being
finished, the first stone that was to serve as record of the age of the
nation, was laid by the high priest, where we see it to-day.I will
remark that the name AKE is one of the Egyptians' divinities, the third
person of the triad of Esneh; always represented as a child, holding his
finger to his mouth.To-day the meaning of the
word is lost in Yucatan.Cogolludo, in his history of Yucatan, speaking of the manner in which
they computed time, says:

"They counted their ages and eras, which they inscribed in their books
every twenty years, in lustrums of four years.* * * When five of these
lustrums were completed, they called the lapse of twenty years _katun_,
which means to place a stone down upon another.* * * In certain sacred
buildings and in the houses of the priests every twenty years they place
a hewn stone upon those already there.When seven of these stones have
thus been piled one over the other began the _Ahau katun_.Then after
the first lustrum of four years they placed a small stone on the top of
the big one, commencing at the east corner; then after four years more
they placed another small stone on the west corner; then the next at the
north; and the fourth at the south.At the end of the twenty years they
put a big stone on the top of the small ones: and the column, thus
finished, indicated a lapse of one hundred and sixty years."There are other methods for determining the approximate age of the
monuments of Mayab:

1st.By means of their actual orientation; starting from the _fact_ that
their builders always placed either the faces or angles of the edifices
fronting the cardinal points.By determining the epoch when the mastodon became extinct.For,
since _Can_ or his ancestors adopted the head of that animal as symbol
of deity, it is evident they must have known it; hence, must have been
contemporary with it.By determining when, through some great cataclysm, the lands became
separated, and all communications between the inhabitants of _Mayab_ and
their colonies were consequently interrupted.If we are to credit what
Psenophis and Sonchis, priests of Heliopolis and Sais, said to Solon
"that nine thousand years before, the visit to them of the Athenian
legislator, in consequence of great earthquakes and inundations, the
lands of the West disappeared in one day and a fatal night," then we may
be able to form an idea of the antiquity of the ruined cities of America
and their builders.Reader, I have brought before you, without comments, some of the FACTS,
that after ten years of research, the paintings on the walls of
_Chaacmol's_ funeral chamber, the sculptured inscriptions carved on the
stones of the crumbling monuments of Yucatan, and a comparative study of
the vernacular of the aborigines of that country, have revealed to us.Many years of further patient investigations,
the full interpretation of the monumental inscriptions, and, above all,
the possession of the libraries of the learned men of _Mayab_, are the
_sine qua non_ to form an uncontrovertible one, free from the
speculations which invalidate all books published on the subject
heretofore.If by reading these pages you have learned something new, your time has
not been lost; nor mine in writing them.Transcriber's Note

arched overhead with whispering trees, the stars came out one by one,
showing faintly between waving branches; and she perceived dimly that
a figure that was vaguely compounded of David and Peter and the
handsomest of all the young kings of Spain, had quietly taken its
place in the bow and had busied itself with the paddles,--whereupon
she was summoned to dinner, where the ten Hutchinsons and their guests
were awaiting her.David, the only member of the group whose summer vacation had actually
begun, was sitting on the broad veranda of an exclusive country club
several hundreds of miles away from New York and looking soberly into
the eyes of a blue ribbon bull dog, whose heavy jowl rested on his
knees.His mother, in one of the most fashionable versions of the
season's foulards, sleekly corseted and coifed, was sitting less than
a hundred yards away from him, fanning herself with three inches of
hand woven fan and contemplating David.In the dressing-room above,
just alighted from a limousine de luxe, was a raven-haired,
crafty-eyed ingenue (whose presence David did not suspect or he would
have recollected a sudden pressing engagement out of her vicinity),
preening herself for conquest.David's mind, unlike the minds of the
"other gifted members of the We Are Seven Club," to quote Jimmie's
most frequent way of referring to them, was to all intents and
purposes a total blank.He answered monosyllabically his mother's
questions, patted the dog's beetling forehead and thought of nothing
at all for practically forty-five minutes.Then he rose, and offering
his arm to his mother led her gravely to the table reserved for him in
the dining-room.Gertrude, in her studio at the top of the house in Fifty-sixth Street
where she lived with her parents, was putting the finishing touches on
a faun's head; and a little because she had unconsciously used
Jimmie's head for her model, and a little because of her conscious
realization at this moment that the roughly indicated curls over the
brow were like nobody's in the world but Jimmie's, she was thinking of
him seriously.She was thinking also of the dinner on a tray that
would presently be brought up to her, since her mother and father were
out of town, and of her coming two months with Eleanor and her recent
inspiration concerning them.In Colhassett, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the dinner hour and even the
supper hour were long past.In the commodious kitchen of Eleanor's
former home two old people were sitting in calico valanced rockers,
one by either window.The house was a pleasant old colonial structure,
now badly run down but still marked with that distinction that only
the instincts of aristocracy can bestow upon a decaying habitation.A fattish child made her way up the walk, toeing out unnecessarily,
and let herself in by the back door without knocking.Amos," she said, seating herself in a
straight backed, yellow chair, and swinging her crossed foot
nonchalantly, "I thought I would come in to inquire about Eleanor.Ma
said that she heard that she was coming home to live again.Albertina was not a peculiar favorite of Eleanor's grandfather.Amos
Chase had ideas of his own about the proper bringing up of children,
and the respect due from them to their elders.Also Albertina's father
had come from "poor stock."There was a strain of bad blood in her.The women of the Weston families hadn't always "behaved themselves."He therefore answered this representative of the youngest generation
rather shortly."I don't know nothing about it," he said."Why, father," the querulous old voice of Grandmother Chase protested,
"you know she's comin' home somewhere 'bout the end of July, she and
one of her new aunties and a hired girl they're bringing along to do
the work.I don't see why you can't answer the child's question.""I don't know as I'm obligated to answer any questions that anybody
sees fit to put to me."Albertina, pass me my glasses from off the
mantel-tree-shelf, and that letter sticking out from behind the clock
and I'll read what she says."Albertina, with a reproachful look at Mr.Amos, who retired coughing
exasperatedly behind a paper that he did not read, allowed herself to
be informed through the medium of a letter from Gertrude and a
postscript from Eleanor of the projected invasion of the Chase
household."I should think you'd rather have Eleanor come home by herself than
bringing a strange woman and a hired girl," Albertina contributed a
trifle tartly.The distinction of a hired girl in the family was one
which she had long craved on her own account."All nonsense, I call it," the old man ejaculated."Well, Eleena, she writes that she can't get away without one of 'em
comin' along with her and I guess we can manage someways.I dunno what
work city help will make in this kitchen.You can't expect much from
city help.I shall certainly be
dretful pleased to see Eleena, and so will her grandpa--in spite o'
the way he goes on about it."A snort came from the region of the newspaper."I shouldn't think you'd feel as if you had a grandchild now that six
rich people has adopted her," Albertina suggested helpfully."It's a good thing for the child," her grandmother said."I'm so lame
I couldn't do my duty by her.Old folks is old folks, and they can't
do for others like young ones.I'd d'ruther have had her adopted by
one father and mother instead o' this passel o' young folks passing
her around among themselves, but you can't have what you'd d'ruther
have in this world.You got to take what comes and be thankful.""Did she write you about having gold coffee spoons at her last place?""I think they was probably gilded over like ice-cream
spoons, and she didn't know the difference.I guess she has got a lot
of new clothes.Well, I'll have to be getting along.At the precise moment that the door closed behind Albertina, the clock
in Peter Stuyvesant's apartment in New York struck seven and Eleanor,
in a fresh white dress and blue ribbons, slipped into her chair at the
dinner table and waited with eyes blazing with excitement for Peter to
make the momentous discovery of the gift at his plate.CHAPTER XI

GERTRUDE HAS TROUBLE WITH HER BEHAVIOR


"Dear Uncle Peter," Eleanor wrote from Colhassett when she had been
established there under the new regime for a week or more.I am very awfully sorry, but I could not help it.Don't tell Aunt Margaret because it is so contrary to her teachings
and also the golden rule, but she was more contrary to the golden rule
that I was.She said
Aunt Gertrude was homely and an old maid, and the hired girl was
homely too.Well, I think she is, but I am not going to have Albertina
think so.Aunt Gertrude is pretty with those big eyes and ink like
hair and lovely teeth and one dimple.Albertina likes hair fuzzed all
over faces and blonds.Then she said she guessed I wasn't your
favorite, and that the gold spoons were most likely tin gilded over.I
don't know what you think about slapping.Will you please write and
say what you think?You know I am anxsuch to do well.But I think I
know as much as Albertina about some things.She uster treat me like a
dog, but it is most a year now since I saw her before."Well, here we are, Aunt Gertrude and me, too.Grandpa did not like
her at first.She looked so much like summer folks, and acted that
way, too.He does not agree with summer folks, but she got him talking
about foreign parts and that Spanish girl that made eyes at him, and
nearly got him away from Grandma, and the time they were wrecked going
around the horn, and showing her dishes and carvings from China.Grandma likes her
too, but not when Grandpa tells her about that girl in Spain."We eat in the dining-room, and have lovely food, only Grandpa does
not like it, but we have him a pie now for breakfast,--his own pie
that he can eat from all the time and he feels better.Aunt Gertrude
is happy seeing him eat it for breakfast and claps her hands when he
does it, only he doesn't see her."She is teaching me more manners, and to swim, and some French.It is
vacation and I don't have regular lessons, the way I did while we
were on Long Island."Didn't we have a good time in that hotel?Do you remember the night I
stayed up till ten o'clock and we sat on the beach and talked?I would miss you more if I believed what Albertina said about my
not being your favorite.Uncle Jimmie is coming and then I
don't know what Albertina will say.Aunt Gertrude's idea of getting me cultivated is
to read to me from the great Masters of literature and funny books
too, like Mark Twain and the Nonsense Thology.Then I say what I think
of them, and she just lets me develop along those lines, which is
pretty good for summer."The sun and wind are on the sea,
                  The waves are clear and blue,
                This is the place I like to be,
                  If I could just have you."The insects chirrup in the grass,
                  The birds sing in the tree,
                And oh!how quick the time would pass
                  If you were here with me.""What do you think of slapping, Aunt Gertrude?"Eleanor asked one
evening when they were walking along the hard beach that the receding
tide had left cool and firm for their pathway, and the early moon had
illumined for them."Do you think it's awfully bad to slap any one?""I wouldn't slap you, if that's what you mean, Eleanor.""Would you slap somebody your own size and a little bigger?""I thought perhaps you would," Eleanor sighed with a gasp of relieved
satisfaction."I don't believe in moral suasion entirely, Eleanor," Gertrude tried
to follow Eleanor's leads, until she had in some way satisfied the
child's need for enlightenment on the subject under discussion.It was
not always simple to discover just what Eleanor wanted to know, but
Gertrude had come to believe that there was always some excellent
reason for her wanting to know it."I think there are some quarrels
that have to be settled by physical violence.""I want to bring
myself up good when--when all of my aunts and uncles are too busy, or
don't know.I want to grow up, and be ladylike and a credit, and I'm
getting such good culture that I think I ought to, but--I get worried
about my refinement.City refinement is different from country
refinement.""Refinement isn't a thing that you can worry about," Gertrude began
slowly.She realized perhaps better than any of the others, being a
better balanced, healthier creature than either Beulah or Margaret,
that there were serious defects in the scheme of cooperative
parentage.Eleanor, thanks to the overconscientious digging about her
roots, was acquiring a New England self-consciousness about her
processes.A child, Gertrude felt, should be handed a code ready made
and should be guided by it without question until his maturer
experience led him to modify it.The trouble with trying to explain
this to Eleanor was that she had already had too many things
explained to her, and the doctrine of unselfconsciousness can not be
inculcated by an exploitation of it."If you are naturally a fine
person your instinct will be to do the fine thing.You must follow it
when you feel the instinct and not think about it between times.""That's Uncle Peter's idea," Eleanor said, "that not thinking.Well,
I'll try--but you and Uncle Peter didn't have six different parents
and a Grandpa and Grandma and Albertina all criticizing your
refinement in different ways.Don't you ever have any trouble with
your behavior, Aunt Gertrude?"The truth was that she was having considerable
trouble with her behavior since Jimmie's arrival two days before.She
had thought to spend her two months with Eleanor on Cape Cod helping
the child to relate her new environment to her old, while she had the
benefit of her native air and the freedom of a rural summer.She also
felt that one of their number ought to have a working knowledge of
Eleanor's early surroundings and habits.She had meant to put herself
and her own concerns entirely aside.If she had a thought for any one
but Eleanor she meant it to be for the two old people whose guest she
had constituted herself.She explained all this to Jimmie a day or two
before her departure, and to her surprise he had suggested that he
spend his own two vacation weeks watching the progress of her
experiment.Before she was quite sure of the wisdom of allowing him to
do so she had given him permission to come.Jimmie was part of her
trouble.Her craving for isolation and undiscovered country; her
eagerness to escape with her charge to some spot where she would not
be subjected to any sort of familiar surveillance, were all a part of
an instinct to segregate herself long enough to work out the problem
of Jimmie and decide what to do about it.This she realized as soon as
he arrived on the spot.She realized further that she had made
practically no progress in the matter, for this curly headed young
man, bearing no relation to anything that Gertrude had decided a young
man should be, was rapidly becoming a serious menace to her peace of
mind, and her ideal of a future lived for art alone.She had
definitely begun to realize this on the night when Jimmie, in his
exuberance at securing his new job, had seized her about the waist and
kissed her on the lips.She had thought a good deal about that kiss,
which came dangerously near being her first one.She was too clever,
too cool and aloof, to have had many tentative love-affairs.Later, as
she softened and warmed and gathered grace with the years she was
likely to seem more alluring and approachable to the gregarious male.Now she answered her small interlocutor truthfully."Yes, Eleanor, I do have a whole lot of trouble with my behavior.I'm
having trouble with it today, and this evening," she glanced up at the
moon, which was seemingly throwing out conscious waves of effulgence,
"I expect to have more," she confessed.asked Eleanor, "I'm sorry I can't sit up with you then
and help you.You--you don't expect to be--provocated to _slap_
anybody, do you?""No, I don't, but as things are going I almost wish I did," Gertrude
answered, not realizing that before the evening was over there would
be one person whom she would be ruefully willing to slap several times
over.As they turned into the village street from the beach road they met
Jimmie, who had been having his after-dinner pipe with Grandfather
Amos, with whom he had become a prime favorite.With him was
Albertina, toeing out more than ever and conversing more than
blandly."This virtuous child has been urging me to come after Eleanor and
remind her that it is bedtime," Jimmie said, indicating the pink
gingham clad figure at his side."She argues that Eleanor is some six
months younger than she and ought to be in bed first, and personally
she has got to go in the next fifteen minutes.""It's pretty hot weather to go to bed in," Albertina said."Miss
Sturgis, if I can get my mother to let me stay up half an hour more,
will you let Eleanor stay up?"Just beyond her friend, in the shadow of her ample back, Eleanor was
making gestures intended to convey the fact that sitting up any longer
was abhorrent to her."Eleanor needs her sleep to-night, I think," Gertrude answered,
professionally maternal."I brought Albertina so that our child might go home under convoy,
while you and I were walking on the beach," Jimmie suggested.As the two little girls fell into step, the beginning of their
conversation drifted back to the other two, who stood watching them
for a moment."I thought I'd come over to see if you was willing to say you were
sorry," Albertina began."My face stayed red in one spot for two hours
that day after you slapped me.""I'm not sorry," Eleanor said ungraciously, "but I'll say that I am,
if you've come to make up.""Well, we won't say any more about it then," Albertina conceded."Are
Miss Sturgis and Mr.Sears going together, or are they just friends?""Isn't that Albertina one the limit?"Jimmie inquired, with a piloting
hand under Gertrude's elbow."She told me that she and Eleanor were
mad, but she didn't want to stay mad because there was more going on
over here than there was at her house and she liked to come over.""I'm glad Eleanor slapped her," Gertrude said; "still I'm sorry our
little girl has uncovered the clay feet of her idol.She's through
with Albertina for good.""Do you know, Gertrude," Jimmy said, as they set foot on the
glimmering beach, "you don't seem a bit natural lately.You used to be
so full of the everlasting mischief.Every time you opened your mouth
I dodged for fear of being spiked.Yet here you are just as docile as
other folks.""Don't you like me--as well?"Gertrude tried her best to make her
voice sound as usual."Better," Jimmie swore promptly; then he added a qualifying--"I
guess."But she didn't allow him the opportunity to answer."I'm in a transition period, Jimmie," she said."I meant to be such a
good parent to Eleanor and correct all the evil ways into which she
has fallen as a result of all her other injudicious training, and,
instead of that, I'm doing nothing but think of myself and my own
hankerings and yearnings and such.I thought I could do so much for
the child.""That's the way we all think till we tackle her and then we find it
quite otherwise and even more so.Tell me about your hankerings and
yearnings.""Tell me about your job, Jimmie."And for a little while they found themselves on safe and familiar
ground again.Jimmie's new position was a very satisfactory one.He
found himself associated with men of solidity and discernment, and for
the first time in his business career he felt himself appreciated and
stimulated by that appreciation to do his not inconsiderable best.Gertrude was the one woman--Eleanor had not yet attained the inches
for that classification--to whom he ever talked business."Now, at last, I feel that I've got my feet on the earth, Gertrude; as
if the stuff that was in me had a chance to show itself, and you don't
know what a good feeling that is after you've been marked trash by
your family and thrown into the dust heap.""I know you are, 'Trude.It isn't
everybody I'd talk to like this.The moonlight beat down upon them in floods of sentient palpitating
glory.Little breathy waves sought the shore and whispered to it.The
pines on the breast of the bank stirred softly and tenderly."Lord, what a night," Jimmie said, and began burying her little white
hand in the beach sand."Now
tell me about your job," he said."I don't think I want to talk about my job tonight."There was no question about her voice sounding as
usual this time.Jimmie brushed the sand slowly away from the buried hand and covered
it with his own.He drew nearer, his face close, and closer to hers.It was coming, it was coming and she was
glad.That silly old vow of celibacy, her silly old thoughts about
art.What was anything with the arms of the man you
loved closing about you.Jimmie drew a sharp breath, and let her go."Gertrude," he said, "I'm incorrigible.I'd
make love to--Eleanor's grandmother if I had her down here on a night
like this.Gertrude got to her feet a little unsteadily, but she managed a
smile."It's only the moon," she said, "and--and young blood.I think
Grandfather Amos would probably affect me the same way."Jimmie's momentary expression of blankness passed and Gertrude did not
press her advantage."It's awfully companionable to realize that you also are human,
'Trude," he hazarded on the doorstep.Gertrude put a still hand into his, which is a way of saying "Good
night," that may be more formal than any other."The Colonel's lady, and July O'Grady," she quoted lightly.Up-stairs in her great chamber under the eaves, Eleanor was composing
a poem which she copied carefully on a light blue page of her private
diary.It read as follows:

                "To love, it is the saddest thing,
                  When friendship proves unfit,
                For lots of sadness it will bring,
                  When e'er you think of it.that friends should prove untrue
                  And disappoint you so.Because you don't know what to do,
                  And hardly where to go."CHAPTER XII

MADAM BOLLING


"Is this the child, David?"Eleanor stared impassively into the lenses of Mrs.Eleanor courtesied as her Uncle Jimmie had taught her, but she did not
take her eyes from Mrs.I hate this American fashion of dressing
children like French dolls, in bright colors and smart lines.An English country child would have
cheeks as red as apples."I should have thought her younger, David.I'll teach her the ropes when the strangeness
begins to wear off.This kind of thing is all new to her, you know."Give her the blue chamber and tell Mademoiselle to
take charge of her.You say you want her to have lessons for so many
hours a day.She writes verses, she models pretty well,
Gertrude says.It's too soon to expect any special aptitude to
develop.""Well, I'm glad to discover your philanthropic tendencies, David.I
never knew you had any before, but this seems to me a very doubtful
undertaking.You take a child like this from very plain surroundings
and give her a year or two of life among cultivated and well-to-do
people, just enough for her to acquire a taste for extravagant living
and associations.You get tired of your
bargain.You marry--and then what
becomes of your protegee?She goes back to the country, a thoroughly
unsatisfied little rustic, quite unfitted to be the wife of the farmer
for whom fate intended her.""I wish you wouldn't, mother," David said, with an uneasy glance at
Eleanor's pale face, set in the stoic lines he remembered so well from
the afternoon of his first impression of her.It never hurts anybody to have a plain understanding of his
position in the world.I don't know what foolishness you romantic
young people may have filled her head with.It's just as well she
should hear common sense from me and I intend that she shall.""I've explained to you, mother, that this child is my legal and moral
responsibility and will be partly at least under my care until she
becomes of age.I want her to be treated as you'd treat a child of
mine if I had one.If you don't, I can't have her visit us again.I
shall take her away with me somewhere.Bringing her home to you this
time is only an experiment.""She'll have a much more healthful and normal experience with us than
she's had with any of the rest of your violent young set, I'll be
bound.She can look out for Zaidee--I
never say that name without irritation--but it's the only name the
little beast will answer to.Eleanor started at the suddenness of the question, but did not reply
to it.Bolling waited and David looked at her expectantly."My mother asked you if you liked dogs, Eleanor; didn't you
understand?"Eleanor opened her lips as if to speak and then shut them again
firmly."Your protegee is slightly deaf, David," his mother assured him."You can tell her 'yes,'" Eleanor said unexpectedly to David."I like
dogs, if they ain't treacherous.""She asked you the question," David said gravely; "this is her house,
you know."Why can't I talk to you about her, the way she does about me?""She can have consideration if she wants it, but she
doesn't think I'm any account.Let her ask you what she wants and I'll
tell you.""Eleanor," David remonstrated, "Eleanor, you never behaved like this
before.I don't know what's got into her, mother."Eleanor fixed her big blue eyes on the lorgnette again."If it's manners to talk the way you do to your own children and
strange little girls, why, then I don't want any," she said."I guess
I'll be going," she added abruptly and turned toward the door.David took her by the shoulders and brought her right about face."Say good-by to mother," he said sternly."Good-by, ma'am--madam," Eleanor said and courtesied primly."Tell Mademoiselle to teach her a few things before the next audience,
David, and come back to me in fifteen minutes.I have something
important to talk over with you."David stood by the open door of the blue chamber half an hour later
and watched Eleanor on her knees, repacking her suit-case.Her face
was set in pale determined lines, and she looked older and a little
sick.Outside it was blowing a September gale, and the trees were
waving desperate branches in the wind.David had thought that the
estate on the Hudson would appeal to the little girl.It had always
appealed to him so much, even though his mother's habits of migration
with the others of her flock at the different seasons had left him so
comparatively few associations with it.He had thought she would like
the broad sweeping lawns and the cherubim fountain, the apple orchard
and the kitchen garden, and the funny old bronze dog at the end of the
box hedge.When he saw how she was occupied, he understood that it was
not her intention to stay and explore these things."Eleanor," he said, stepping into the room suddenly, "what are you
doing with your suit-case?Didn't Mademoiselle unpack it for you?"He
was close enough now to see the signs of tears she had shed.Her eyes fell and she tried desperately to control a quivering lip."Because I am--I want to go back.""I ain't wanted," she said, her head low."I made up my mind to go
back to my own folks.I'm not going to be adopted any more."David led her to the deep window-seat and made her sit facing him.He
was too wise to attempt a caress with this issue between them."Do you think that's altogether fair to me?""I guess it won't make much difference to you."Do you think it will be fair to your other aunts and uncles who have
given so much care and thought to your welfare?""If they do get tired of their bargain it will be because they've
turned out to be very poor sports.I've known every one of them a long
time, and I've never known them to show any signs of poor
sportsmanship yet.If you run away without giving them their chance to
make good, it will be you who are the poor sport.""She said you would marry and get tired of me, and I would have to go
back to the country.If you marry and Uncle Jimmie marries--then Uncle
Peter will marry, and--"

"You'd still have your Aunts Beulah and Margaret and Gertrude," David
could not resist making the suggestion.If one person broke up the vow, I guess they
all would."But even if we did, Eleanor, even if we all married, we'd still
regard you as our own, our child, our charge."The tears came now, and David gathered the
little shaking figure to his breast."I don't want to be the wife of
the farmer for whom fate intended me," she sobbed."I want to marry
somebody refined with extravagant living and associations.""That's one of the things we are bringing you up for, my dear."This
aspect of the case occurred to David for the first time, but he
realized its potency."You mustn't take mother too seriously.Just
jolly her along a little and you'll soon get to be famous friends.She's never had any little girls of her own, only my brother and me,
and she doesn't know quite how to talk to them.""The Hutchinsons had a hired butler and gold spoons, and they didn't
think I was the dust beneath their feet.I don't know what to say to
her.I said ain't, and I wasn't refined, and I'll only just be a
disgrace to you.I'd rather go back to Cape Cod, and go out to work,
and stand Albertina and everything.""If you think it's the square thing to do," David said slowly, "you
may go, Eleanor.I'll take you to New York to-morrow and get one of
the girls to take you to Colhassett.Of course, if you do that it will
put me in rather an awkward position.The others have all had you for
two months and made good on the proposition.I shall have to admit
that I couldn't even keep you with me twenty-four hours.Peter and
Jimmie got along all right, but I couldn't handle you at all.As a
cooperative parent, I'm such a failure that the whole experiment goes
to pieces through me.""Well, it's the same thing,--you couldn't stand the surroundings I
brought you to.You couldn't even be polite to my mother for my
sake.""I--never thought of that, Uncle David.""Think of it now for a few minutes, won't you, Eleanor?"The rain was beginning to lash the windows, and to sweep the lawn in
long slant strokes.The little girl held up her face as if it could
beat through the panes on it."I thought," she said slowly, "that after Albertina I wouldn't _take_
anything from anybody.Uncle Peter says that I'm just as good as
anybody, even if I have been out to work.He said that all I had to do
was just to stand up to people.""There are a good many different ways of standing up to people,
Eleanor.Be sure you've got the right way and then go ahead.""I guess I ought to have been politer," Eleanor said slowly."I ought
to have thought that she was your own mother.You couldn't help the
way she acted, o' course.""The way you acted is the point, Eleanor.""I'll act different if you want me to, Uncle David," she said, "and I
won't go and leave you."I don't think that I altogether cover myself
with glory in an interview with my mother," he added."It isn't the
thing that I'm best at, I admit.""You did pretty good," Eleanor consoled him."I guess she makes you
kind of bashful the way she does me," from which David gathered with
an odd sense of shock that Eleanor felt there was something to
criticize in his conduct, if she had permitted herself to look for
it."I know what I'll do," Eleanor decided dreamily with her nose against
the pane."I'll just pretend that she's Mrs.O'Farrel's aunt, and then
whatever she does, I shan't care.I'll know that I'm the strongest and
could hit her if I had a mind to, and then I shan't want to.""By the time you grow up, Eleanor," he said finally, "you will have
developed all your cooperative parents into fine strong characters.*       *       *       *       *

"The dog got nearly drownded today in the founting," Eleanor wrote."It is a very little dog about the size of Gwendolyn.It was out with
Mademoiselle, and so was I, learning French on a garden seat.It
teetered around on the edge of the big wash basin--the founting looks
like a wash basin, and suddenly it fell in.I waded right in and got
it, but it slipped around so I couldn't get it right away.It looked
almost too dead to come to again, but I gave it first aid to the
drownded the way Uncle Jimmie taught me to practicing on Gwendolyn.When I got it fixed I looked up and saw Uncle David's mother coming.I
took the dog and gave it to her.I said, 'Madam, here's your dog.'Mademoiselle ran around ringing her hands and talking about it.Bolling's room, and we talked.I told her how to make
mustard pickles, and how my mother's grandpa's relation came over in
the Mayflower, and about our single white lilac bush, and she's going
to get one and make the pickles.Then I played double Canfield with
her for a while.I'm glad I didn't go home before I knew her better.O'Farrel's aunt I pretend she is her, and we
don't quarrel.She says does Uncle David go much to see Aunt Beulah,
and I say, not so often as Uncle Jimmie does.Then she says does he go
to see Aunt Margaret, and I say that he goes to see Uncle Peter the
most.Well, if he doesn't he almost does.Madam
Bolling that you won't tattle, because she would think the worst."*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor grew to like Mademoiselle.She was the aging, rather wry
faced Frenchwoman who had been David's young brother's governess and
had made herself so useful to Mrs.Bolling that she was kept always on
the place, half companion and half resident housekeeper.She was glad
to have a child in charge again, and Eleanor soon found that her
crooked features and severe high-shouldered back that had somewhat
intimidated her at first, actually belonged to one of the kindest
hearted creatures in the world.Paris and Colhassett bore very little resemblance to each other, the
two discovered.To be sure there were red geraniums every alternating
year in the gardens of the Louvre, and every year in front of the
Sunshine Library in Colhassett.The residents of both places did a
great deal of driving in fine weather.In Colhassett they drove on the
state highway, recently macadamized to the dismay of the taxpayers who
did not own horses or automobiles.In Paris they drove out to the Bois
by way of the Champs Elysees.In Colhassett they had only one
ice-cream saloon, but in Paris they had a good many of them
out-of-doors in the parks and even on the sidewalk, and there you
could buy all kinds of sirups and 'what you call cordials' and
_aperitifs_; but the two places on the whole were quite different.The people of Colhassett were all
religious and thought it was sinful to play cards on Sundays.Mademoiselle said she always felt wicked when she played them on a
week day."I think of my mother," she said; "she would say 'Juliette, what will
you say to the Lord when he knows that you have been playing cards on
a working day."The Lord that they have in Colhassett is not like that," Eleanor
stated without conscious irreverence."She is a vary fonny child, madam," Mademoiselle answered Mrs."She has taste, but no--experience even of the most
ordinary.She cooks, but she does no embroidery.She knits and knows
no games to play.She has a good brain, but Mon Dieu, no one has
taught her to ask questions with it.""She has had lessons this year from some young Rogers graduates, very
intelligent girls.I should think a year of that kind of training
would have had its effect."Bolling's finger went into every pie
in her vicinity with unfailing direction."Lessons, yes, but no teaching.If she were not vary intelligent I
think she would have suffered for it.The public schools they did
somesing, but so little to elevate--to encourage."Thus in a breath were Beulah's efforts as an educator disposed of."Would you like to undertake the teaching of that child for a year?""I think I'll make the offer to David."Bolling was unsympathetic but she was thorough.Since David and his young friends had undertaken
a venture so absurd, she decided to lend them a helping hand with it.Besides, now that she had no children of her own in the house,
Mademoiselle was practically eating her head off.Also it had
developed that David was fond of the child, so fond of her that to
oppose that affection would have been bad policy, and Mrs.Bolling was
politic when she chose to be.She chose to be politic now, for
sometime during the season she was going to ask a very great favor of
David, and she hoped, that by first being extraordinarily complaisant
and kind and then by bringing considerable pressure to bear upon him,
he would finally do what he was asked.The favor was to provide
himself with a father-in-law, and that father-in-law the
multi-millionaire parent of the raven-haired, crafty-eyed ingenue, who
had begun angling for him that June night at the country club.She made the suggestion to David on the eve of the arrival of all of
Eleanor's guardians for the week-end.Bolling had invited a
house-party comprised of the associated parents as a part of her
policy of kindness before the actual summoning of her forces for the
campaign she was about to inaugurate.David was really touched by his mother's generosity concerning
Eleanor.He had been agreeably surprised at the development of the
situation between the child and his mother.He had been obliged to go
into town the day after Eleanor's first unfortunate encounter with her
hostess, and had hurried home in fear and trembling to try to smooth
out any tangles in the skein of their relationship that might have
resulted from a day in each other's vicinity.After hurrying over the
house and through the grounds in search of her he finally discovered
the child companionably currying a damp and afflicted Pekinese in his
mother's sitting-room, and engaged in a grave discussion of the
relative merits of molasses and sugar as a sweetening for Boston baked
beans.It was while they were having their after-dinner coffee in the
library, for which Eleanor had been allowed to come down, though
nursery supper was the order of the day in the Bolling establishment,
that David told his friends of his mother's offer."Of course, we decided to send her to school when she was twelve
anyway," he said."The idea was to keep her among ourselves for two
years to establish the parental tie, or ties I should say.If she is
quartered here with Mademoiselle we could still keep in touch with her
and she would be having the advantage of a year's steady tuition under
one person, and we'd be relieved--" a warning glance from Margaret,
with an almost imperceptible inclination of her head in the direction
of Beulah, caused him to modify the end of his sentence--"of the
responsibility--for her physical welfare.""Mentally and morally," Gertrude cut in, "the bunch would still
supervise her entirely."Jimmie, who was sitting beside her, ran his arm along the back of her
chair affectionately, and then thought better of it and drew it away.He was, for some unaccountable reason, feeling awkward and not like
himself.There was a girl in New York, with whom he was not in the
least in love, who had recently taken it upon herself to demonstrate
unmistakably that she was not in love with him.There was another girl
who insisted on his writing her every day.Here was Gertrude, who
never had any time for him any more, absolutely without enthusiasm at
his proximity.He thought it would be a good idea to allow Eleanor to
remain where she was and said so."Not that I won't miss the jolly times we had together, Babe," he
said."I was planning some real rackets this year,--to make up for
what I put you through," he added in her ear, as she came and stood
beside him for a minute.Gertrude wanted to go abroad for a year, "and lick her wounds," as she
told herself.She would have come back for her two months with
Eleanor, but she was glad to be relieved of that necessity.Margaret
had the secret feeling that the ordeal of the Hutchinsons was one that
she would like to spare her foster child, and incidentally herself in
relation to the adjustment of conditions necessary to Eleanor's visit.Peter wanted her with him, but he believed the new arrangement would
be better for the child.Beulah alone held out for her rights and her
parental privileges.She stood in the center of the group a little forlornly while they
awaited her word.A wave of her old shyness overtook her and she
blushed hot and crimson."It's all in your own hands, dear," Beulah said briskly."Poor kiddie," Gertrude thought, "it's all wrong somehow.""I don't know what you want me to say," Eleanor said piteously and
sped to the haven of Peter's breast."We'll manage a month together anyway," Peter whispered."Then I guess I'll stay here," she whispered back, "because next I
would have to go to Aunt Beulah's."Peter, turning involuntarily in Beulah's direction, saw the look of
chagrin and disappointment on her face, and realized how much she
minded playing a losing part in the game and yet how well she was
doing it."She's only a straight-laced kid after all," he thought."She's put her whole heart and soul into this thing.There's a look
about the top part of her face when it's softened that's a little like
Ellen's."Ellen was his dead fiancee--the girl in the photograph at
home in his desk."I guess I'll stay here," Eleanor said aloud, "all in one place, and
study with Mademoiselle."It was a decision that, on the whole, she never regretted.CHAPTER XIII

BROOK AND RIVER


                   "Standing with reluctant feet,
                   Where the brook and river meet.""I think it's a good plan to put a quotation like Kipling at the top
of the page whenever I write anything in this diary," Eleanor began in
the smart leather bound book with her initials stamped in black on the
red cover--the new private diary that had been Peter's gift to her on
the occasion of her fifteenth birthday some months before."I think it
is a very expressive thing to do.The quotation above is one that
expresses me, and I think it is beautiful too.Miss Hadley--that's my
English teacher--the girls call her Haddock because she does look
rather like a fish--says that it's undoubtedly one of the most
poignant descriptions of adolescent womanhood ever made.I made a note
to look up adolescent, but didn't.Bertha Stephens has my dictionary,
and won't bring it back because the leaves are all stuck together
with fudge, and she thinks she ought to buy me a new one.It is very
honorable of her to feel that way, but she never will.Good old
Stevie, she's a great borrower."'Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
             For borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.'"Well, I hardly know where to begin.I thought I would make a resume
of some of the events of the last year.I was only fourteen then, but
still I did a great many things that might be of interest to me in my
declining years when I look back into the annals of this book.To
begin with I was only a freshie at Harmon.It is very different to be
a sophomore.I can hardly believe that I was once a shivering looking
little thing like all the freshmen that came in this year.I was very
frightened, but did not think I showed it.wad some power the giftie gie us,
               To see ourselves as others see us.'"Robert Burns had twins and a rather bad character, but after he met
his bonnie Jean he wrote very beautiful poetry.A poet's life is
usually sad anyhow--full of disappointment and pain--but I digress."I had two years with Mademoiselle at the Bollings' instead of one the
way we planned.I haven't written in my Private Diary since the night
of that momentous decision that I was to stay in one place instead of
taking turns visiting my cooperative parents.I went to another school
one year before I came to Harmon, and that brings me to the threshold
of my fourteenth year.If I try to go back any farther, I'll never
catch up.I spent that vacation with Aunt Margaret in a cottage on
Long Island with her sister, and her sister's boy, who has grown up to
be the silly kind that wants to kiss you and pull your hair, and those
things.Aunt Margaret is so lovely I can't think of words to express
it.rare pale Margaret,' as Tennyson says.She wears her hair in
a coronet braid around the top of her head, and all her clothes are
the color of violets or a soft dovey gray or white, though baby blue
looks nice on her especially when she wears a fishyou."I went down to Cape Cod for a week before I came to Harmon, and while
I was there my grandmother died.I can't write about that in this
diary.I loved my grandmother and my grandmother loved me.Uncle Peter
came, and took charge of everything.He has great strength that holds
you up in trouble."The first day I came to Harmon I saw the girl I wanted for my best
friend, and so we roomed together, and have done so ever since.Her
name is Margaret Louise Hodges, but she is called Maggie Lou by every
one.She has dark curly hair, and deep brown eyes, and a very silvery
voice.I have found out that she lies some, but she says it is because
she had such an unhappy childhood, and has promised to overcome it for
my sake."That Christmas vacation the 'We Are Sevens' went up the Hudson to the
Bollings' again, but that was the last time they ever went there.Uncle David and his mother had a terrible fight over them.I was sorry
for Madam Bolling in a way.There was a girl she wanted Uncle David to
marry, a rich girl who looked something like Cleopatra, very dark
complexioned with burning eyes.She had a sweet little Pekinese
something like Zaidee."Uncle David said that gold could never buy him, and to take her away,
but Madam Bolling was very angry, of course.She accused him of
wanting to marry Aunt Margaret, and called her a characterless, faded
blonde.Then it was Uncle David's turn to get angry, and I have never
seen any one get any angrier, and he told about the vow of celibacy,
and how instead of having designs on him the whole crowd would back
him up in his struggle to stay single.I told
Madam Bolling that I would help her to get Uncle David back, and I
did, but she never forgave the other aunts and uncles.I suppose the
feelings of a mother would prompt her to want Uncle David settled down
with a rich and fashionable girl who would soon be the mother of a lot
of lovely children.I can't imagine a Cleopatra looking baby, but she
might have boys that looked like Uncle David."Vacations are really about all there is to school.Freshman year is
mostly grinding and stuffing.Having six parents to send you boxes of
'grub' is better than having only two.Some of the girls are rather
selfish about the eats, and come in and help themselves boldly when
you are out of the room.Maggie Lou puts up signs over the candy box:
'Closed for Repairs,' or 'No Trespassing by Order of the Board of
Health,' but they don't pay much attention.Well, last summer vacation
I spent with Uncle Jimmie.I wouldn't tell this, but I reformed him.I don't know what pledge it was because I
didn't read it, but he said he was addicted to something worse than
anything I could think of, and if somebody didn't pull him up, he
wouldn't answer for the consequences.I asked him why he didn't choose
Aunt Gertrude to do it, and he groaned only.So I said to write out a
pledge, and sign it and I would be the witness.We were at a hotel
with his brother's family.It isn't proper any more for me to go
around with my uncles unless I have a chaperon.Mademoiselle says that
I oughtn't even to go down-town alone with them but, of course, that
is French etiquette, and not American.Well, there were lots of pretty
girls at this hotel, all wearing white and pink dresses, and carrying
big bell shaped parasols of bright colors.They looked sweet, like so
many flowers, but Uncle Jimmie just about hated the sight of them.He
said they were not girls at all, but just pink and white devices of
the devil.On the whole he didn't act much like my merry uncle, but we
had good times together playing tennis and golf, and going on parties
with his brother's family, all mere children but the mother and
father.Uncle Jimmie was afraid to go and get his mail all summer,
although he had a great many letters on blue and lavender note paper
scented with Roger et Gallet's violet, and Hudnut's carnation.We used
to go down to the beach and make bonfires and burn them unread, and
then toast marshmallows in their ashes.He said that they were
communications from the spirits of the dead.I should have thought
that they were from different girls, but he seemed to hate the sight
of girls so much.Once I asked him if he had ever had an unhappy
love-affair, just to see what he would say, but he replied 'no, they
had all been happy ones,' and groaned and groaned."Aunt Beulah has changed too.She has become a suffragette and thinks
only of getting women their rights and their privileges."Maggie Lou is an anti, and we have long arguments about the cause.She says that woman's place is in the home, but I say look at me, who
have no home, how can I wash and bake and brew like the women of my
grandfather's day, visiting around the way I do?And she says that it
is the principle of the thing that is involved, and I ought to take a
stand for or against.Everybody has so many different arguments that I
don't know what I think yet, but some day I shall make up my mind for
good."Well, that about brings me up to the present.I meant to describe a
few things in detail, but I guess I will not begin on the past in that
way.I don't get so awfully much time to write in this diary because
of the many interruptions of school life, and the way the monitors
snoop in study hours.I don't know who I am going to spend my
Christmas holidays with.I sent Uncle Peter a poem three days ago, but
he has not answered it yet.I'm afraid he thought it was very silly.I
don't hardly know what it means myself.It goes as follows:

                              "A Song

                "The moon is very pale to-night,
                  The summer wind swings high,
                I seek the temple of delight,
                  And feel my love draw nigh."I seem to feel his fragrant breath
                  Upon my glowing cheek.Between us blows the wind of death,--
                  I shall not hear him speak."I don't know why I like to write love poems, but most of the women
poets did.CHAPTER XIV

MERRY CHRISTMAS


Margaret in mauve velvet and violets, and Gertrude in a frock of smart
black and white were in the act of meeting by appointment at Sherry's
one December afternoon, with a comfortable cup of tea in mind.Gertrude emerged from the recess of the revolving door and Margaret,
sitting eagerly by the entrance, almost upset the attendant in her
rush to her friend's side.Gertrude," she cried, "I'm so glad to see you.My family is
trying to cut me up in neat little quarters and send me north, south,
east and west, for the Christmas holidays, and I want to stay home and
have Eleanor.How did I ever come to be born into a family of giants,
tell me that, Gertrude?""The choice of parents is thrust upon us at an unfortunately immature
period, I'll admit," Gertrude laughed."My parents are dears, but
they've never forgiven me for being an artist instead of a dubby bud.Shall we have tea right away or shall we sit down and discuss life?""I don't know which is the hungrier--flesh or
spirit."But as they turned toward the dining-room a familiar figure blocked
their progress."I thought that was Gertrude's insatiable hat," David exclaimed
delightedly."I've phoned for you both until your families have given
instructions that I'm not to be indulged any more.I've got a surprise
for you.--Taxi," he said to the man at the door."Not till we've had our tea," Margaret wailed."You couldn't be so
cruel, David.""You shall have your tea, my dear, and one of the happiest surprises
of your life into the bargain," David assured her as he led the way to
the waiting cab."I wouldn't leave this place unfed for anybody but you, David, not if
it were ever so, and then some, as Jimmie says.""What's the matter with Jimmie, anyhow?"David inquired as the taxi
turned down the Avenue and immediately entangled itself in a hopeless
mesh of traffic.Gertrude answered, though she had not been the
one addressed at the moment.she
rattled on without waiting for an answer."I thought it was
good-looking myself, and Madam Paran robbed me for it.""It is good-looking," David allowed."It seems to be a kind of
retrieving hat, that's all.Keeps you in a rather constant state of
looking after the game."It's a lovely cross
between the style affected by the late Emperor Napoleon and my august
grandmother, with some frills added."The chauffeur turned into a cross street and stopped abruptly before
an imposing but apparently unguarded entrance."Why, I thought this was a studio building," Gertrude said."David, if
you're springing a tea party on us, and we in the wild ungovernable
state we are at present, I'll shoot the way my hat is pointing.""Straight through my left eye-glass," David finished."You wait till
you see the injustice you have done me."But Margaret, who often understood what was happening a few moments
before the revelation of it, clutched at his elbow.David, David," she whispered, "how wonderful!""Wait till you see," David said, and herded them into the elevator.David hurried them around
the bend in the sleekly carpeted corridor and touched the bell on the
right of the first door they came to.It opened almost instantly and
David's man, who was French, stood bowing and smiling on the
threshold.Styvvisont has arrive'," he said; "he waits you.""Welcome to our city," Peter cried, appearing in the doorway of the
room Alphonse was indicating with that high gesture of delight with
which only a Frenchman can lead the way."Jimmie's coming up from the
office and Beulah's due any minute.What do you think of the place,
girls?""It's really
ours, that's what it is.I've broken away from the mater at last," he
added a little sheepishly.I've got an
all-day desk job in my uncle's office and I'm going to dig in and see
what I can make of myself.Also, this is going to be our headquarters,
and Eleanor's permanent home if we're all agreed upon it,--but look
around, ladies.If you think I can interior
decorate, just tell me so frankly."It's like that old conundrum--black and white and red all over,"
Gertrude said."I never saw anything so stunning in all my life."I admire your nerve," Peter cried, "papering this place in
white, and then getting in all this heavy carved black stuff, and the
red in the tapestries and screens and pillows.""I wanted it to look studioish a little," David explained, "I wanted
to get away from Louis Quartorze.""And drawing-rooms like mother used to make," Gertrude suggested.Do you see, Margaret, everything is Indian
or Chinese?The ubiquitous Japanese print is conspicuous by its
absence.""I've got two portfolios full of 'em," David said, "and I always have
one or two up in the bedrooms.I change 'em around, you know, the way
the <DW61>s do themselves, a different scene every few days and the rest
decently out of sight till you're ready for 'em.""It's like a fairy story," Margaret said."I thought you'd appreciate what little Arabian Nights I was able to
introduce.I bought that screen," he indicated a sweep of Chinese line
and color, "with my eye on you, and that Aladdin's lamp is yours, of
course.You're to come in here and rub it whenever you like, and your
heart's desire will instantly be vouchsafed to you."Peter suggested, as David led the way through
the corridor and up the tiny stairs which led to the more intricate
part of the establishment."This is her room, didn't you say, David?"He paused on the threshold of a bedroom done in ivory white and
yellow, with all its hangings of a soft golden silk."She once said that she wanted a yellow room," David said, "a
daffy-down-dilly room, and I've tried to get her one.I know last
year that Maggie Lou child refused to have yellow curtains in that
flatiron shaped sitting-room of theirs, and Eleanor refused to be
comforted."A wild whoop in the below stairs announced Jimmie; and Beulah arrived
simultaneously with the tea tray.Jimmie was ecstatic when the actual
function of the place was explained to him."Headquarters is the one thing we've lacked," he said; "a place of our
own, hully gee!"You haven't been feeling altogether human lately, have you, Jimmie?""I'm a bad
egg," he explained to her darkly, "and the only thing you can do with
me is to scramble me.""Scrambled is just about the way I should have described your behavior
of late,--but that's Gertrude's line," David said."Only she doesn't
seem to be taking an active part in the conversation.Aren't you
Jimmie's keeper any more, Gertrude?""Not since she's come back from abroad," Jimmie muttered without
looking at her."Eleanor's taken the job over now," Peter said."She's made him swear
off red ink and red neckties.""Any color so long's it's red is the color that suits me best," Jimmie
quoted."Lord, isn't this room a pippin?"He swam in among the bright
pillows of the divan and so hid his face for a moment.It had been a
good many weeks since he had seen Gertrude."I want to give a suffrage tea here," Beulah broke in suddenly."It's
so central, but I don't suppose David would hear of it.""Angels and Ministers of Grace defend us--" Peter began."My _mother_ would hear of it," David said, "and then there wouldn't
be any little studio any more.She doesn't believe in votes for
women.""How any woman in this day and age--" Beulah began, and thought better
of it, since she was discussing Mrs."Makes your blood boil, doesn't it--Beulahland?"Gertrude suggested
helpfully, reaching for the tea cakes."Never mind, I'll vote for
women."The Lord helps those that help themselves," Peter said, "that's why
Gertrude is a suffragist.She believes in helping herself, in every
sense, don't you, 'Trude?""Not quite in every sense," Gertrude said gravely."Sometimes I feel
like that girl that Margaret describes as caught in a horrid way
between two generations."I'd rather be that way than early Victorian," Margaret sighed."Speaking of the latest generation, has anybody any objection to
having our child here for the holidays?""My idea is to
have one grand Christmas dinner.I suppose we'll all have to eat one
meal with our respective families, but can't we manage to get together
here for dinner at night?"We can't, but we will," Margaret murmured.I wanted her with me but the family thought otherwise.They've
been trying to send me away for my health, David."You'll stay in New York for your health and come
to my party.""Margaret's health is merely a matter of Margaret's happiness anyhow.Her soul and her body are all one," Gertrude said."Then cursed be he who brings anything but happiness to Margaret,"
Peter said, to which sentiment David added a solemn "Amen.""I wish you wouldn't," Margaret said, shivering a little, "I feel as
if some one were--were--"

"Trampling the violets on your grave," Gertrude finished for her.Christmas that year fell on a Monday, and Eleanor did not leave school
till the Friday before the great day.Owing to the exigencies of the
holiday season none of her guardians came to see her before the dinner
party itself.Even David was busy with his mother--installed now for a
few weeks in the hotel suite that would be her home until the opening
of the season at Palm Beach--and had only a few hurried words with
her.Mademoiselle, whom he had imported for the occasion, met her at
the station and helped her to do her modest shopping which consisted
chiefly of gifts for her beloved aunts and uncles.She had arranged
these things lovingly at their plates, and fled to dress when they
began to assemble for the celebration.The girls were the first
arrivals."I had a few minutes' talk
with her over the telephone and she seemed to be flourishing.""She's grown several feet since we last saw
her.They've been giving scenes from Shakespeare at school and she's
been playing Juliet, it appears.She has had a fight with another girl
about suffrage--I don't know which side she was on, Beulah, I am
merely giving you the facts as they came to me--and the other girl was
so unpleasant about it that she has been visited by just retribution
in the form of the mumps, and had to be sent home and quarantined.""Sounds a bit priggish," Peter suggested."Not really," David said, "she's as sound as a nut.She's only going
through the different stages.""To pass deliberately through one's ages," Beulah quoted, "is to get
the heart out of a liberal education.""Bravo, Beulah," Gertrude cried, "you're quite in your old form
to-night.""Is she just the same little girl, David?"I don't know why
she doesn't come down.No, it's only Alphonse
letting in Jimmie."Jimmie, whose spirits seemed to have revived under the holiday
influence, was staggering under the weight of his parcels.The
Christmas presents had already accumulated to a considerable mound on
the couch.Margaret was brooding over them and trying not to look
greedy.She was still very much of a child herself in relation to
Santa Claus.My eyes--but you're a slick trio, girls.Pale
lavender, pale blue, and pale pink, and all quite sophisticatedly
decollete.I don't know quite why
you do, but you do.""Give honor where honor is due, dearie.That's owing to the cleverness
of the decorator," David said."No man calls me dearie and lives to tell the tale," Jimmie remarked
almost dreamily as he squared off.But at that instant there was an unexpected interruption.Alphonse
threw open the big entrance door at the farther end of the long room
with a flourish."Mademoiselle Juliet Capulet," he proclaimed with the grand air, and
then retired behind his hand, smiling broadly.Framed in the high doorway, complete, cap and curls, softly rounding
bodice, and the long, straight lines of the Renaissance, stood
Juliet--Juliet, immemorial, immortal, young--austerely innocent and
delicately shy, already beautiful, and yet potential of all the beauty
and the wisdom of the world."I've never worn these clothes before anybody but the girls before,"
Eleanor said, "but I thought"--she looked about her appealingly--"you
might like it--for a surprise.""Great jumping Jehoshaphat," Jimmie exclaimed, "I thought you said she
was the same little girl, David.""She was half an hour ago," David answered, "I never saw such a
metamorphosis.In fact, I don't think I ever saw Juliet before.""She is the thing itself," Gertrude answered, the artist in her
sobered by the vision.But Peter passed a dazed hand over his eyes and stared at the delicate
figure advancing to him.she's a woman," he said, and drew the hard breath of a man
just awakened from sleep.[Illustration: "I thought"--she looked about her appealingly--"you might
like it--for a surprise"]




CHAPTER XV

GROWING UP


"Dear Uncle Jimmie:

"It was a pleasant surprise to get letters from every one of my uncles
the first week I got back to school.You wrote
me two letters last year, Uncle David six, and Uncle Peter sixteen.He
is the best correspondent, but perhaps that is because I ask him the
most advice.I shall never forget the
expressions on all the different faces when I came down in my Juliet
suit.I thought at first that no one liked me in it, but I guess they
did."You know how well I liked my presents because you heard my wild
exclamations of delight.It was
sweet of the We Are Sevens to get me that ivory set, and to know that
every different piece was the loving thought of a different aunt or
uncle.It looks entirely unique, and I
like to have things that are not like anybody else's in the world,
don't you, Uncle Jimmie?They are
'neat,' but not 'gaudy.'You play golf so well I thought a golf stick
was a nice emblem for you, and would remind you of me and last
summer."I am glad you think it is easier to keep your pledge now.I made a
New Year's resolution to go without chocolates, and give the money
they would cost to some good cause, but it's hard to pick out a cause,
or to decide exactly how much money you are saving.I can eat the
chocolates that are sent to me, however!!!!"Uncle David said that he thought you were not like yourself lately,
but you seemed just the same to me Christmas, only more affectionate.I was really only joking about the chocolates.*       *       *       *       *

"Dear Uncle David:

"I was glad to get your nice letter.You did not have to write in
response to my bread and butter letter, but I am glad you did.When I
am at school, and getting letters all the time I feel as if I were
living two beautiful lives all at once, the life of a 'cooperative
child' and the life of Eleanor Hamlin, schoolgirl, both together.Letters make the people you love seem very near to you, don't you
think they do?I sleep with all my letters under my pillow whenever I
feel the least little bit homesick, and they almost seem to breathe
sometimes.Maggie Lou had a wrist watch, too, for
Christmas, but not so pretty as the one you gave me.Miss Hadley says
I do remarkable work in English whenever I feel like it.I don't know
whether that's a compliment or not.I took Kris Kringle for the
subject of a theme the other day, and represented him as caught in an
iceberg in the grim north, and not being able to reach all the poor
little children in the tenements and hovels.The Haddock said it
showed imagination."There was a lecture at school on Emerson the other day.The speaker
was a noted literary lecturer from New York.He had wonderful waving
hair, more like Pader--I can't spell him, but you know who I
mean--than Uncle Jimmie's, but a little like both.He introduced some
very noble thoughts in his discourse, putting perfectly old ideas in
a new way that made you think a lot more of them.I think a tall man
like that with waving hair can do a great deal of good as a lecturer,
because you listen a good deal more respectfully than if they were
plain looking.His voice sounded a good deal like what I imagine
Romeo's voice did.I had a nice letter from Madam Bolling.I love you,
and I have come to the bottom of the sheet.*       *       *       *       *

"Dear Uncle Peter:

"I have just written to my other uncles, so I won't write you a long
letter this time.They deserve letters because of being so unusually
prompt after the holidays.You always deserve letters, but not
specially now, any more than any other time."Uncle Peter, I wrote to my grandfather.It seems funny to think of
Albertina's aunt taking care of him now that Grandma is gone.I
suppose Albertina is there a lot.She sent me a post card for
Christmas."Uncle Peter, I miss my grandmother out of the world.I remember how I
used to take care of her, and put a soapstone in the small of her
back when she was cold.I wish sometimes that I could hold your hand,
Uncle Peter, when I get thinking about it."Well, school is the same old school.Bertha Stephens has a felon on
her finger, and that lets her out of hard work for a while.I will
enclose a poem suggested by a lecture I heard recently on Emerson.It
isn't very good, but it will help to fill up the envelope."Life

                 "Life is a great, a noble task,
                   When we fulfill our duty.To work, that should be all we ask,
                   And seek the living beauty.We know not whence we come, or where
                   Our dim pathway is leading,
                 Whether we tread on lilies fair,
                   Or trample love-lies-bleeding.But we must onward go and up,
                   Nor stop to question whither.E'en if we drink the bitter cup,
                   And fall at last, to wither."P. S. I haven't got the last verse very good yet, but I think the
second one is pretty.You know 'love-lies-bleeding' is a flower, but
it sounds allegorical the way I have put it in.*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor's fifteenth year was on the whole the least eventful year of
her life, though not by any means the least happy.She throve
exceedingly, and gained the freedom and poise of movement and
spontaneity that result from properly balanced periods of work and
play and healthful exercise.From being rather small of her age she
developed into a tall slender creature, inherently graceful and erect,
with a small, delicate head set flower-wise on a slim white neck.Gertrude never tired of modeling that lovely contour, but Eleanor
herself was quite unconscious of her natural advantages.She preferred
the snappy-eyed, stocky, ringleted type of beauty, and spent many
unhappy quarters of an hour wishing she were pretty according to the
inexorable ideals of Harmon.She spent her vacation at David's apartment in charge of Mademoiselle,
though the latter part of the summer she went to Colhassett, quite by
herself according to her own desire, and spent a month with her
grandfather, now in charge of Albertina's aunt.She found Albertina
grown into a huge girl, sunk in depths of sloth and snobbishness, who
plied her with endless questions concerning life in the gilded circles
of New York society.Eleanor found her disgusting and yet possessed of
that vague fascination that the assumption of prerogative often
carries with it.She found her grandfather very old and shrunken, yet perfectly taken
care of and with every material want supplied.She realized as she had
never done before how the faithful six had assumed the responsibility
of this household from the beginning, and how the old people had been
warmed and comforted by their bounty.She laughed to remember her
simplicity in believing that an actual salary was a perquisite of her
adoption, and understood for the first time how small a part of the
expense of their living this faithful stipend had defrayed.She looked
back incredulously on that period when she had lived with them in a
state of semi-starvation on the corn meal and cereals and very little
else that her dollar and a half a week had purchased, and the "garden
sass," that her grandfather had faithfully hoed and tended in the
straggling patch of plowed field that he would hoe and tend no more.She spent a month practically at his feet, listening to his stories,
helping him to find his pipe and tobacco and glasses, and reading the
newspaper to him, and felt amply rewarded by his final acknowledgment
that she was a good girl and he would as soon have her come again
whenever she felt like it.On her way back to school she spent a week with her friend, Margaret
Louise, in the Connecticut town where she lived with her comfortable,
commonplace family.It was while she was on this visit that the most
significant event of the entire year took place, though it was a
happening that she put out of her mind as soon as possible and never
thought of it again when she could possibly avoid it.Maggie Lou had a brother of seventeen, and one night in the corner of
a moonlit porch, when they happened to be alone for a half hour, he
had asked Eleanor to kiss him."I don't want to kiss you," Eleanor said.Then, not wishing to convey
a sense of any personal dislike to the brother of a friend to whom
she was so sincerely devoted, she added, "I don't know you well
enough."He was a big boy, with mocking blue eyes and rough tweed clothes that
hung on him loosely."When you know me better, will you let me kiss you?""I don't know," Eleanor said, still endeavoring to preserve the
amenities.He took her hand and played with it softly."You're an awful sweet little girl," he said.He pulled her back to the
chair from which she had half arisen."I don't believe in kissing _you_," she tried to say, but the words
would not come.She could only pray for deliverance through the
arrival of some member of the family.The boy's face was close to
hers.It looked sweet in the moonlight she thought.She wished he
would talk of something else besides kissing."Well, then, there's no more to be said."His breath came heavily, with little irregular catches
in it.She pushed him away and turned into the house."Don't be angry, Eleanor," he pleaded, trying to snatch at her hand."I'm not angry," she said, her voice breaking, "I just wish you
hadn't, that's all."There was no reference to this incident in the private diary, but,
with an instinct which would have formed an indissoluble bond between
herself and her Uncle Jimmie, she avoided dimly lit porches and boys
with mischievous eyes and broad tweed covered shoulders.For her guardians too, this year was comparatively smooth running and
colorless.Beulah's militant spirit sought the assuagement of a fierce
expenditure of energy on the work that came to her hand through her
new interest in suffrage.Gertrude flung herself into her sculpturing.She had been hurt as only the young can be hurt when their first
delicate desires come to naught.She was very warm-blooded and eager
under her cool veneer, and she had spent four years of hard work and
hungry yearning for the fulness of a life she was too constrained to
get any emotional hold on.Her fancy for Jimmie she believed was
quite over and done with.Margaret, warmed by secret fires and nourished by the stuff that
dreams are made of, flourished strangely in her attic chamber, and
learned the wisdom of life by some curious method of her own of
apprehending its dangers and delights.The only experiences she had
that year were two proposals of marriage, one from a timid professor
of the romance languages and the other from a young society man,
already losing his waist line, whose sensuous spirit had been stirred
by the ethereal grace of hers; but these things interested her very
little.She was the princess, spinning fine dreams and waiting for the
dawning of the golden day when the prince should come for her.Neither
she nor Gertrude ever gave a serious thought to the five-year-old vow
of celibacy, which was to Beulah as real and as binding as it had
seemed on the first day she took it.Peter and David and Jimmie went their own way after the fashion of
men, all of them identified with the quickening romance of New York
business life.David in Wall Street was proving to be something of a
financier to his mother's surprise and amazement; and the pressure
relaxed, he showed some slight initiative in social matters.In fact,
two mothers, who were on Mrs.Bolling's list as suitable
parents-in-law, took heart of grace and began angling for him
adroitly, while their daughters served him tea and made unabashed,
modern-debutante eyes at him.Jimmie, successfully working his way up to the top of his firm,
suffered intermittently from his enthusiastic abuse of the privileges
of liberty and the pursuit of happiness.His mind and soul were in
reality hot on the trail of a wife, and there was no woman among those
with whom he habitually foregathered whom his spirit recognized as his
own woman.He was further rendered helpless and miserable by the fact
that he had not the slightest idea of his trouble.He regarded himself
as a congenital Don Juan, from whom his better self shrank at times
with a revulsion of loathing.Peter felt that he had his feet very firmly on a rather uninspired
earth.He was getting on in the woolen business, which happened to be
the vocation his father had handed down to him.He belonged to an
amusing club, and he still felt himself irrevocably widowed by the
early death of the girl in the photograph he so faithfully cherished.Eleanor was a very vital interest in his life.It had seemed to him
for a few minutes at the Christmas party that she was no longer the
little girl he had known, that a lovelier, more illusive creature--a
woman--had come to displace her, but when she had flung her arms
around him he had realized that it was still the heart of a child
beating so fondly against his own.The real trouble with arrogating to ourselves the privileges of
parenthood is that our native instincts are likely to become deflected
by the substitution of the artificial for the natural responsibility.Both Peter and David had the unconscious feeling that their obligation
to their race was met by their communal interest in Eleanor.Beulah,
of course, sincerely believed that the filling in of an intellectual
concept of life was all that was required of her.Only Jimmie groped
blindly and bewilderedly for his own.Gertrude and Margaret both
understood that they were unnaturally alone in a world where lovers
met and mated, but they, too, hugged to their souls the flattering
unction that they were parents of a sort.Thus three sets of perfectly suitable and devoted young men and
women, of marriageable age, with dozens of interests and sympathies in
common, and one extraordinarily vital bond, continued to walk side by
side in a state of inhuman preoccupation, their gaze fixed inward
instead of upon one another; and no Divine Power, happening upon the
curious circumstance, believed the matter one for His intervention nor
stooped to take the respective puppets by the back of their
unconscious necks, and so knock their sluggish heads together.CHAPTER XVI

MARGARET LOUISA'S BIRTHRIGHT


"I am sixteen years and eight months old to-day," Eleanor wrote, "and
I have had the kind of experience that makes me feel as if I never
wanted to be any older.I know life is full of disillusionment and
pain, but I did not know that any one with whom you have broken bread,
and slept in the same room with, and told everything to for four long
years, could turn out to be an absolute traitor and villainess.For nearly a year now I have noticed that
Bertha Stephens avoided me, and presented the appearance of disliking
me.I don't like to have any one dislike me, and I have tried to do
little things for her that would win back her affection, but with no
success.As I was editing the Lantern I could print her essayettes (as
she called them) and do her lots of little favors in a literary way,
which she seemed to appreciate, but personally she avoided me like the
plague."Of course Stevie has lots of faults, and since Margaret Louise and I
always talked everything over we used to talk about Stevie in the same
way.I remember that she used to try to draw me out about Stevie's
character.I've always thought Stevie was a kind of piker, that is
that she would say she was going to do a thing, and then from sheer
laziness not do it.She gummed it
all up with her nasty fudge and then wouldn't give it back to me or
get me another, but the reason she wouldn't give it back to me was
because her feelings were too fine to return a damaged article, and
not fine enough to make her hump herself and get me another.That's
only one kind of a piker and not the worst kind, but it was
_pikerish_."All this I told quite frankly to Maggie--I mean Margaret Louise,
because I had no secrets from her and never thought there was any
reason why I shouldn't.Stevie has a horrid brother, also, who has
been up here to dances.All the girls hate him because he is so
spoony.He isn't as spoony as Margaret Louise's brother, but he's
quite a sloppy little spooner at that.Well, I told Margaret Louise
that I didn't like Stevie's brother, and then I made the damaging
remark that one reason I didn't like him was because he looked so much
like Stevie.I didn't bother to explain to Maggie--I will not call her
Maggie Lou any more, because that is a dear little name and sounds so
affectionate,--Margaret Louise--what I meant by this, because I
thought it was perfectly evident.Stevie is a peachy looking girl, a
snow white blonde with pinky cheeks and dimples.Well, her brother is
a snow white blond too, and he has pinky cheeks and dimples and his
name is Carlo!We, of course, at once named him Curlo.It is not a
good idea for a man to look too much like his sister, or to have too
many dimples in his chin and cheeks.I had only to think of him in the
same room with my three uncles to get his number exactly.I don't mean
to use slang in my diary, but I can't seem to help it.Professor
Mathews says that slang has a distinct function in the language--in
replenishing it, but Uncle Peter says about slang words, that'many
are called, and few are chosen,' and there is no need to try to
accommodate them all in one's vocabulary."Well, I told Margaret Louise all these things about Curlo, and how
he tried to hold my hand coming from the station one day, when the
girls all went up to meet the boys that came up for the dance,--and I
told her everything else in the world that happened to come into my
head."Then one day I got thinking about leaving Harmon--this is our senior
year, of course--and I thought that I should leave all the girls with
things just about right between us, excepting good old Stevie, who had
this queer sort of grouch against me.So I decided that I'd just go
around and have it out with her, and I did.I went into her room one
day when her roommate was out, and demanded a show down.Well, I found
out that Maggie--Margaret Louise had just repeated to Stevie every
living thing that I ever said about her, just as I said it, only
without the explanations and foot-notes that make any kind of
conversation more understandable."Stevie told me all these things one after another, without stopping,
and when she was through I wished that the floor would open and
swallow me up, but nothing so comfortable happened.I was obliged to
gaze into Stevie's overflowing eyes and own up to the truth as well as
I could, and explain it.It was the most humiliating hour that I ever
spent, but I told Stevie exactly what I felt about her 'nothing
extenuate, and naught set down in malice,' and what I had said about
her to our mutual friend, who by the way, is not the mutual friend of
either of us any longer.We were both crying by the time I had
finished, but we understood each other.There were one or two things
that she said she didn't think she would ever forget that I had said
about her, but even those she could forgive.She said that my dislike
of her had rankled in her heart so long that it took away all the
bitterness to know that I wasn't really her enemy.She said that my
coming to her that way, and not lying had showed that I had lots of
character, and she thought in time that we could be quite intimate
friends if I wanted to as much as she did."After my talk with Stevie I still hoped against hope that Margaret
Louise would turn out to have some reason or excuse for what she had
done.I knew she had done it, but when a thing like that happens that
upsets your whole trust in a person you simply can not believe the
evidence of your own senses.When you read of a situation like that
in a book you are all prepared for it by the author, who has taken the
trouble to explain the moral weakness or unpleasantness of the
character, and given you to understand that you are to expect a
betrayal from him or her; but when it happens in real life out of a
clear sky you have nothing to go upon that makes you even _believe_
what you know."I won't even try to describe the scene that occurred between Margaret
Louise and me.She cried and she lied, and she accused me of trying to
curry favor with Stevie, and Stevie of being a backbiter, and she
argued and argued about all kinds of things but the truth, and when I
tried to pin her down to it, she ducked and crawled and sidestepped in
a way that was dreadful.I've seen her do something like it before
about different things, and I ought to have known then what she was
like inside of her soul, but I guess you have to be the object of such
a scene before you realize the full force of it."All I said was, 'Margaret Louise, if that's all you've got to say
about the injury you have done me, then everything is over between us
from this minute;' and it was, too."I feel as if I had been writing a beautiful story or poem on what I
thought was an enduring tablet of marble, and some one had come and
wiped it all off as if it were mere scribblings on a slate.I don't
know whether it would seem like telling tales to tell Uncle Peter or
not; I don't quite know whether I want to tell him.Sometimes I wish I
had a mother to tell such things to.It seems to me that a real mother
would know what to say that would help you.Disillusion is a very
strange thing--like death, only having people die seems more natural
somehow.When they die you can remember the happy hours that you spent
with them, but when disillusionment comes then you have lost even your
beautiful memories."We had for the subject of our theme this week, 'What Life Means to
Me,' which of course was the object of many facetious remarks from the
girls, but I've been thinking that if I sat down seriously to state in
just so many words what life means to _me_, I hardly know what I would
transcribe.It means disillusionment and death for one thing.Since my
grandfather died last year I have had nobody left of my own in the
world,--no real blood relation.Of course, I am a good deal fonder of
my aunts and uncles than most people are of their own flesh and blood,
but own flesh and blood is a thing that it makes you feel shivery to
be without.If I had been Margaret Louise's own flesh and blood, she
would never have acted like that to me.Stevie stuck up for Carlo as
if he was really something to be proud of.Perhaps my uncles and aunts
feel that way about me, I don't know.I don't even know if I feel that
way about them.I certainly criticize them in my soul at times, and
feel tired of being dragged around from pillar to post.I don't feel
that way about Uncle Peter, but there is nobody else that I am
certain, positive sure that I love better than life itself.If there
is only one in the world that you feel that way about, I might not be
Uncle Peter's one.I wish Margaret Louise had not sold her birthright for a mess of
pottage.I wish I had a home that I had a perfect right to go and live
in forevermore.I wish my mother was here to comfort me to-night."CHAPTER XVII

A REAL KISS


At seventeen, Eleanor was through at Harmon.She was to have one year
of preparatory school and then it was the desire of Beulah's heart
that she should go to Rogers.The others contended that the higher
education should be optional and not obligatory.The decision was
finally to be left to Eleanor herself, after she had considered it in
all its bearings."If she doesn't decide in favor of college," David said, "and she
makes her home with me here, as I hope she will do, of course, I don't
see what society we are going to be able to give her.Unfortunately
none of our contemporaries have growing daughters.She ought to meet
eligible young men and that sort of thing."The two were having a cozy cup of tea at
his apartment."You're so terribly worldly, David, that you frighten
me sometimes.""You don't know where I will end, is that the idea?""I don't know where Eleanor will end, if you're already thinking of
eligible young men for her.""Those things have got to be thought of," David answered gravely."I don't want her to be
married.I want to take her off by myself and growl over her all alone
for a while.Then I want Prince Charming to come along and snatch her
up quickly, and set her behind his milk white charger and ride away
with her.If we've all got to get together and connive at marrying her
off there won't be any comfort in having her.""I don't know," David said thoughtfully; "I think that might be fun,
too.A vicarious love-affair that you can manipulate is one of the
most interesting games in the world.""That's not my idea of an interesting game," Margaret said."I like
things very personal, David,--you ought to know that by this time.""I do know that," David said, "but it sometimes occurs to me that
except for a few obvious facts of that nature I really know very
little about you, Margaret.""There isn't much to know--except that I'm a woman.""That's a good deal," David answered slowly; "to a mere man that seems
to be considerable of an adventure.""It is about as much of an adventure sometimes as it would be to be a
field of clover in an insectless world.--This is wonderful tea, David,
but your cream is like butter and floats around in it in wudges.No,
don't get any more, I've got to go home.Grandmother still thinks it's
very improper for me to call upon you, in spite of Mademoiselle and
your ancient and honorable housekeeper.""Don't go," David said; "I apologize on my knees for the cream.I'll
send out and have it wet down, or whatever you do to cream in that
state."About the cream, or the proprieties?"I'm a little bit tired of being
one, that's all, and I want to go home.""She wants to go home when she's being so truly delightful and
cryptic," David said."Have you been seeing visions, Margaret, in my
hearth fire?She rose and stood absently fitting
her gloves to her fingers."I don't know exactly what it was I saw,
but it was something that made me uncomfortable.It gives me the
creeps to talk about being a woman.David, do you know sometimes I
have a kind of queer hunch about Eleanor?I love her, you know,
dearly, dearly.I think that she is a very successful kind of
Frankenstein; but there are moments when I have the feeling that she's
going to be a storm center and bring some queer trouble upon us.I
wouldn't say this to anybody but you, David."As David tucked her in the car--he had arrived at the dignity of
owning one now--and watched her sweet silhouette disappear, he, too,
had his moment of clairvoyance.He felt that he was letting something
very precious slip out of sight, as if some radiant and delicate gift
had been laid lightly within his grasp and as lightly withdrawn again.As if when the door closed on his friend Margaret some stranger, more
silent creature who was dear to him had gone with her.As soon as he
was dressed for dinner he called Margaret on the telephone to know if
she had arrived home safely, and was informed not only that she had,
but that she was very wroth at him for getting her down three flights
of stairs in the midst of her own dinner toilet."I had a kind of hunch, too," he told her, "and I felt as if I wanted
to hear your voice speaking.""If that's the way you feel about your chauffeur," she said, "you
ought to discharge him, but he brought me home beautifully."The difference between a man's moments of prescience and a woman's, is
that the man puts them out of his consciousness as quickly as he can,
while a woman clings to them fearfully and goes her way a little more
carefully for the momentary flash of foresight.David tried to see
Margaret once or twice during that week but failed to find her in when
he called or telephoned, and the special impulse to seek her alone
again died naturally.One Saturday a few weeks later Eleanor telegraphed him that she
wished to come to New York for the week-end to do some shopping.He went to the train to meet her, and when the slender chic figure in
the most correct of tailor made suits appeared at the gateway, with an
obsequious porter bearing her smart bag and ulster, he gave a sudden
gasp of surprise at the picture.He had been aware for some time of
the increase in her inches and the charm of the pure cameo-cut
profile, but he regarded her still as a child histrionically assuming
the airs and graces of womanhood, as small girl children masquerade in
the trailing skirts of their elders.He was accustomed to the idea
that she was growing up rapidly, but the fact that she was already
grown had never actually dawned on him until this moment."You look as if you were surprised to see me, Uncle David,--are you?"she said, slipping a slim hand, warm through its immaculate glove,
into his."You knew I was coming, and you came to meet me, and yet you
looked as surprised as if you hadn't expected me at all.""Surprised to see you just about expresses it, Eleanor.I was looking for a little girl in hair ribbons with her
skirts to her knees.""And a blue tam-o'-shanter?""And a blue tam-o'-shanter.I had forgotten you had grown up any to
speak of.""You see me every vacation," Eleanor grumbled, as she stepped into the
waiting motor."It isn't because you lack opportunity that you don't
notice what I look like.It's just because you're naturally
unobserving.""Peter and Jimmie have been making a good deal of fuss about your
being a young lady, now I think of it.Peter especially has been
rather a nuisance about it, breaking into my most precious moments of
triviality with the sweetly solemn thought that our little girl has
grown to be a woman now.""Oh, does _he_ think I'm grown up, does he really?"He's all the time wanting me to get you to
New York over the weekend, so that he can see if you are any taller
than you were the last time he saw you.""Are they coming to see me this evening?""Jimmie is going to look in.You
know she's on here from China with her daughter."She must be as grown up as I am," Eleanor said."I used to have her
room, you know, when I stayed with Uncle Peter."Not as much as he likes you, Miss Green-eyes.He says she looks like
a heathen Chinee but otherwise is passable.I didn't know that you
added jealousy to the list of your estimable vices.""I'm not jealous," Eleanor protested; "or if I am it's only because
she's blood relation,--and I'm not, you know.""It's a good deal more prosaic to be a blood relation, if anybody
should ask you," David smiled."A blood relation is a good deal like
the famous primrose on the river's brim.""'A primrose by the river's brim a yellow primrose was to him,--and
nothing more,'" Eleanor quoted gaily."Why, what more--" she broke off
suddenly and  slightly."What more would anybody want to be than a yellow primrose by the
river's brim?""I don't know, I'm sure.I'm a
mere man and such questions are too abstruse for me, as I told your
Aunt Margaret the other day.Now I think of it, though, you don't look
unlike a yellow primrose yourself to-day, daughter.""That's because I've got a yellow ribbon on my hat."It has something to do with
youth and fragrance and the flowers that bloom in the spring.""The flowers that bloom in the spring, tra la," Eleanor returned
saucily, "have nothing to do with the case.""She's learning that she has eyes, good Lord," David said to himself,
but aloud he remarked paternally, "I saw all your aunts yesterday.Gertrude gave a tea party and invited a great many famous tea party
types, and ourselves."Beulah was there, like the famous Queenie,
with her hair in a braid."She's gone in for dress reform now, you know, a kind
of middy blouse made out of a striped portiere with a kilted skirt of
the same material and a Scotch cap.Your Aunt Beulah presents a peculiar phenomenon these days.She's
growing better-looking and behaving worse every day of her life.""She's theory ridden and fad bitten.She'll come to a bad end if
something doesn't stop her.""Do you mean--stop her working for suffrage?I'm a suffragist, Uncle
David.""And quite right to remind me of it before I began slamming the cause.I mean the
way she's going after it.There are healthy ways of insisting on your
rights and unhealthy ways.Beulah's getting further and further off
key, that's all.Your poor old
cooperative father welcomes you to the associated hearthstone.""This front entrance looks more like my front entrance than any other
place does," Eleanor said.she asked the black elevator man, who beamed delightedly
upon her.I didn't know he had one," David chuckled."It takes a
woman--"

Jimmie appeared in the evening, laden with violets and a five pound
box of the chocolates most in favor in the politest circles at the
moment."What's devouring you, papa?""Don't I always place
tributes at the feet of the offspring?""Mirror candy and street corner violets, yes," David said."It's only
the labels that surprised me.""She knows the difference, now," Jimmie answered, "what would you?"The night before her return to school it was decreed that she should
go to bed early.She had spent two busy days of shopping and "seeing
the family."She had her hours discussing her future with Peter, long
visits and talks with Margaret and Gertrude, and a cup of tea at
suffrage headquarters with Beulah, as well as long sessions in the
shops accompanied by Mademoiselle, who made her home now permanently
with David.She sat before the fire drowsily constructing pyramids out
of the embers and David stood with one arm on the mantel, smoking his
after-dinner cigar, and watching her."I can't seem to make up my mind, Uncle David.""Yes, I'd love it,--if--"

"If what, daughter?""If I thought I could spare the time.""I'm going to earn my own living, you know."I've got to--in order to--to feel right about things.""Don't you like the style of living to which your cooperative parents
have accustomed you?""I love everything you've ever done for me, but I can't go on letting
you do things for me forever."It doesn't seem--right, that's all.""It's your New England conscience, Eleanor; one of the most specious
varieties of consciences in the world.It will always be tempting you
to do good that better may come.I don't know whether I would be better
fitted to earn my living if I went to business college or real
college."I can't think,--I'm stupefied.""Uncle Peter couldn't think, either.""Have you mentioned this brilliant idea to Peter?""He talked it over with me, but I think he thinks I'll change my
mind."Eleanor, we're all
able to afford you--the little we spend on you is nothing divided
among six of us.When did you come to
this extraordinary decision?"Bolling talked to me, I think.There are things she said that I've never forgotten.I told Uncle
Peter to think about it and then help me to decide which to do, and I
want you to think, Uncle David, and tell me truly what you believe
the best preparation for a business life would be.I thought perhaps I
might be a stenographer in an editorial office, and my training there
would be more use to me than four years at college, but I don't
know.""You're an extraordinary young woman," David said, staring at her."I'm glad you broached this subject, if only that I might realize how
extraordinary, but I don't think anything will come of it, my dear.I
don't want you to go to college unless you really want to, but if you
do want to, I hope you will take up the pursuit of learning as a
pursuit and not as a means to an end."Then let's have no more of this nonsense of earning your own
living.""Are you really displeased, Uncle David?""I should be if I thought you were serious,--but it's bedtime.If
you're going to get your beauty sleep, my dear, you ought to begin on
it immediately."Eleanor rose obediently, her brow clouded a little, and her head held
high.David watched the color coming and going in the sweet face and
the tender breast rising and falling with her quickening breath."I thought perhaps you would understand," she said.She had always kissed him "good night" until this visit, and he had
refrained from commenting on the omission before, but now he put out
his hand to her."There is only one way
for a daughter to say good night to her parent."She put up her face, and as she did so he caught the glint of tears in
her eyes."Why, Eleanor, dear," he said, "did you care?"With his arms still about her shoulder he stood looking down at her.A
hot tide of crimson made its way slowly to her brow and then receded,
accentuating the clear pallor of her face."That was a real kiss, dear," he said slowly."We mustn't get such
things confused.I won't bother you with talking about it to-night, or
until you are ready.Until then we'll pretend that it didn't happen,
but if the thought of it should ever disturb you the least bit, dear,
you are to remember that the time is coming when I shall have
something to say about it; will you remember?""Yes, Uncle David," Eleanor said uncertainly, "but I--I--"

David took her unceremoniously by the shoulders."Go now," he said, and she obeyed him without further question.CHAPTER XVIII

BEULAH'S PROBLEM


Peter was shaving for the evening.His sister was giving a dinner
party for two of her husband's fellow bankers and their wives.After
that they were going to see the latest Belasco production, and from
there to some one of the new dancing "clubs,"--the smart cabarets that
were forced to organize in the guise of private enterprises to evade
the two o'clock closing law.Peter enjoyed dancing, but he did not as
a usual thing enjoy bankers' wives.He was deliberating on the
possibility of excusing himself gracefully after the theater, on the
plea of having some work to do, and finally decided that his sister's
feelings would be hurt if she realized he was trying to escape the
climax of the hospitality she had provided so carefully.He gazed at himself intently over the drifts of lather and twisted his
shaving mirror to the most propitious angle from time to time.In the
room across the hall--Eleanor's room, he always called it to
himself--his young niece was singing bits of the Mascagni intermezzo
interspersed with bits of the latest musical comedy, in a rather
uncertain contralto."My last girl came from Vassar, and I don't know where to class her.""My last girl--" and
began at the beginning of the chorus again."My last girl came from
Vassar," which brought him by natural stages to the consideration of
the higher education and of Beulah, and a conversation concerning her
that he had had with Jimmie and David the night before."She's off her nut," Jimmie said succinctly."It's not exactly that
there's nobody home," he rapped his curly pate significantly, "but
there's too much of a crowd there.She's not the same old girl at all.She used to be a good fellow, high-brow propaganda and all.Now she's
got nothing else in her head."It's what hasn't happened to her that's addled her," David explained."It's these highly charged, hypersensitive young women that go to
pieces under the modern pressure.They're the ones that need licking
into shape by all the natural processes.""By which you mean a drunken husband and a howling family?""Feminism isn't the answer to
Beulah's problem.""It is the problem," David said; "she's poisoning herself with it.My cousin Jack
married a girl with a sister a great deal like Beulah, looks,
temperament, and everything else, though she wasn't half so nice.She
got going the militant pace and couldn't stop herself.I never met her
at a dinner party that she wasn't tackling somebody on the subject of
man's inhumanity to woman.She ended in a sanitorium; in fact, they're
thinking now of taking her to the--"

"--bug house," Jimmie finished cheerfully."And in the beginning she was a perfectly good girl that needed
nothing in the world but a chance to develop along legitimate lines.""The frustrate matron," David agreed gravely."I wonder you haven't
realized this yourself, Gram.You're keener about such things than I
am.Beulah is more your job than mine.""You're the only one she listens to or looks up to.Go up and tackle
her some day and see what you can do."Give her the once over and throw out the lifeline," Jimmie said."I thought all this stuff was a phase, a part of her taking herself
seriously as she always has.I had no idea it was anything to worry
about," Peter persisted."Are you sure she's in bad shape--that she's
got anything more than a bad attack of Feminism of the Species in its
most virulent form?They come out of _that_, you know.""She's batty," Jimmie nodded gravely."Go up and look her over," David persisted; "you'll see what we mean,
then.Peter reviewed this conversation while he shaved the right side of his
face, and frowned prodigiously through the lather.He wished that he
had an engagement that evening that he could break in order to get to
see Beulah at once, and discover for himself the harm that had come to
his friend.He had always felt that he saw
a little more clearly than the others the virtue that was in the girl.He admired the pluck with which she made her attack on life and the
energy with which she accomplished her ends.There was to him
something alluring and quaint about her earnestness.The fact that her
soundness could be questioned came to him with something like a shock.As soon as he was dressed he was called to the telephone to talk to
David."Margaret has just told me that Doctor Penrose has been up to see
Beulah and pronounces it a case of nervous breakdown.He wants her to
try out <DW43>-analysis, and that sort of thing.He seems to feel that
it's serious.Margaret is fearfully upset, poor girl.So'm I, to tell
the truth.""And so am I," Peter acknowledged to himself as he hung up the
receiver.He was so absorbed during the evening that one of the
ladies--the wife of the fat banker--found him extremely dull and
decided against asking him to dinner with his sister.The wife of the
thin banker, who was in his charge at the theater, got the benefit of
his effort to rouse himself and grace the occasion creditably, and
found him delightful.By the time the evening was over he had decided
that Beulah should be pulled out of whatever dim world of dismay and
delusion she might be wandering in, at whatever cost.It was
unthinkable that she should be wasted, or that her youth and splendid
vitality should go for naught.He found her eager to talk to him the next night when he went to see
her."Peter," she said, "I want you to go to my aunt and my mother, and
tell them that I've got to go on with my work,--that I can't be
stopped and interrupted by this foolishness of doctors and nurses.I
never felt better in my life, except for not being able to sleep, and
I think that is due to the way they have worried me.I live in a world
they don't know anything about, that's all.Even if they were right,
if I am wearing myself out soul and body for the sake of the cause,
what business is it of theirs to interfere?I'm working for the souls
and bodies of women for ages to come.What difference does it make if
my soul and body suffer?Peter
observed the unnatural light in them, the apparent dryness of her
lips, the two bright spots burning below her cheek-bones."Because," he answered her slowly, "I don't think it was the original
intention of Him who put us here that we should sacrifice everything
we are to the business of emphasizing the superiority of a sex.""That isn't the point at all, Peter.No man understands, no man can
understand.It's woman's equality we want emphasized, just literally
that and nothing more.You've pauperized and degraded us long
enough--"

"Thou canst not say I--" Peter began."Yes, you and every other man, every man in the world is a party to
it.""I had to get her going," Peter apologized to himself, "in order to
get a point of departure.Not if I vote for women, Beulah, dear," he
added aloud."If you throw your influence with us instead of against us," she
conceded, "you're helping to right the wrong that you have permitted
for so long.""Well, granting your premise, granting all your premises, Beulah--and
I admit that most of them have sound reasoning behind them--your
battle now is all over but the shouting.There's no reason that you
personally should sacrifice your last drop of energy to a campaign
that's practically won already.""If you think the mere franchise is all I have been working for,
Peter,--"

"I don't.I know the thousand and one activities you women are
concerned with.I know how much better church and state always have
been and are bound to be, when the women get behind and push, if they
throw their strength right."Beulah rose enthusiastically to this bait and talked rationally and
well for some time.Just as Peter was beginning to feel that David and
Jimmie had been guilty of the most unsympathetic exaggeration of her
state of mind--unquestionably she was not as fit physically as
usual--she startled him with an abrupt change into almost hysterical
incoherence."I have a right to live my own life," she concluded, "and
nobody--nobody shall stop me.""We are all living our own lives, aren't we?""No woman lives her own life to-day," Beulah cried, still excitedly."Every woman is living the life of some man, who has the legal right
to treat her as an imbecile."How about the suffrage states, how about the women
who are already in the proud possession of their rights and
privileges?They are not technical imbeciles any longer according to
your theory.Every woman will be a super-woman in
two shakes,--so what's devouring you, as Jimmie says?""It's after all the states have suffrage that the big fight will
really begin," Beulah answered wearily."It's the habit of wearing the
yoke we'll have to fight then.""The anti-feminists," Peter said, "I see.Beulah, can't you give
yourself any rest, or is the nature of the cause actually suicidal?"To his surprise her tense face quivered at this and she tried to
steady a tremulous lower lip."I am tired," she said, a little piteously, "dreadfully tired, but
nobody cares.""They only want to stop me doing something they have no sympathy with.What do Gertrude and Margaret know of the real purpose of my life or
my failure or success?They take a sentimental interest in my health,
that's all.Do you suppose it made any difference to Jeanne d'Arc how
many people took a sympathetic interest in her health if they didn't
believe in what she believed in?""I thought Eleanor would grow up to take an interest in the position
of women, and to care about the things I cared about, but she's not
going to.""Not as fond as she is of Margaret."Peter longed to dispute this, but he could not in honesty."She's so lukewarm she might just as well be an anti.They drag us back like
so much dead weight.""I suppose Eleanor has been a disappointment to you," Peter mused,
"but she tries pretty hard to be all things to all parents, Beulah.You'll find she won't fail you if you need her.""I shan't need her," Beulah said, prophetically."I hoped she'd stand
beside me in the work, but she's not that kind.She'll marry early and
have a family, and that will be the end of her.""I wonder if she will," Peter said, "I hope so.She still seems such
a child to me.I believe in marriage, Beulah, don't you?"I made a vow once that I would never
marry and I've always believed that it would be hampering and limiting
to a woman, but now I see that the fight has got to go on.If there
are going to be women to carry on the fight they will have to be born
of the women who are fighting to-day.""It doesn't make any difference why
you believe it, if you do believe it.""It makes all the difference," Beulah said, but her voice softened."What I believe is more to me than anything else in the world,
Peter."I understand your point of view, Beulah.You
carry it a little bit too far, that's all that's wrong with it from my
way of thinking.""Will you help me to go on, Peter?"Tell them that they're all wrong in
their treatment of me.""I think I could undertake to do that"--Peter was convinced that a
less antagonistic attitude on the part of her relatives would be more
successful--"and I will.""You're the only one who comes anywhere near knowing," she said, "or
who ever will, I guess.I try so hard, Peter, and now when I don't
seem to be accomplishing as much as I want to, as much as it's
necessary for me to accomplish if I am to go on respecting myself,
every one enters into a conspiracy to stop my doing anything at all.The only thing that makes me nervous is the way I am thwarted and
opposed at every turn."Perhaps not, but you have something remarkably like _idee fixe_,"
Peter said to himself compassionately.He found her actual condition less dangerous but much more difficult
than he had anticipated.She was living wrong, that was the sum and
substance of her malady.Her life was spent confronting theories and
discounting conditions.She did not realize that it is only the
interest of our investment in life that we can sanely contribute to
the cause of living.Our capital strength and energy must be used for
the struggle for existence itself if we are to have a world of
balanced individuals.There is an arrogance involved in assuming
ourselves more humane than human that reacts insidiously on our health
and morals.Peter, looking into the twitching hectic face before him
with the telltale glint of mania in the eyes, felt himself becoming
helpless with pity for a mind gone so far askew.He felt curiously
responsible for Beulah's condition."She wouldn't have run herself so far aground," he thought, "if I had
been on the job a little more.I could have helped her to steer
straighter.A word here and a lift there and she would have come
through all right.Now something's got to stop her or she can't be
stopped.She'll preach once too often out of the tail of a cart on the
subject of equal guardianship,--and--"

Beulah put her hands to her face suddenly, and, sinking back into the
depths of the big cushioned chair on the edge of which she had been
tensely poised during most of the conversation, burst into tears."You're the only one that knows," she sobbed over and over again."I'm so tired, Peter, but I've got to go on and on and on.If they
stop me, I'll kill myself."Peter crossed the room to her side and sat down on her chair-arm."Don't cry, dear," he said, with a hand on her head."You're too tired
to think things out now,--but I'll help you."She lifted a piteous face, for the moment so startlingly like that of
the dead girl he had loved that his senses were confused by the
resemblance."I think I see the way," he said slowly.He slipped to his knees and gathered her close in his arms."I think this will be the way, dear," he said very gently."Does this mean that you want me to marry you?"she whispered, when
she was calmer."If you will, dear," he said."I will,--if I can, if I can make it seem right to after I've thought
it all out.--Oh!"I had no idea of that," he said gravely, "but it's wonderful that
you do.I'll put everything I've got into trying to make you happy,
Beulah."Her arms closed around his neck and
tightened there.He made her comfortable and she relaxed like a tired child, almost
asleep under his soothing hand, and the quiet spell of his
tenderness."I didn't know it could be like this," she whispered.In his heart he was saying, "This is best.It
is the right and normal way for her--and for me."In her tri-cornered dormitory room at the new school which she was not
sharing with any one this year Eleanor, enveloped in a big brown and
yellow wadded bathrobe, was writing a letter to Peter.Her hair hung
in two golden brown braids over her shoulders and her pure profile was
bent intently over the paper.At the moment when Beulah made her
confession of love and closed her eyes against the breast of the man
who had just asked her to marry him, two big tears forced their way
between Eleanor's lids and splashed down upon her letter.CHAPTER XIX

MOSTLY UNCLE PETER


"Dear Uncle Peter," the letter ran, "I am very, very homesick and
lonely for you to-day.It seems to me that I would gladly give a whole
year of my life just for the privilege of being with you, and talking
instead of writing,--but since that can not be, I am going to try and
write you about the thing that is troubling me.I can't bear it alone
any longer, and still I don't know whether it is the kind of thing
that it is honorable to tell or not.So you see I am very much
troubled and puzzled, and this trouble involves some one else in a way
that it is terrible to think of."Uncle Peter, dear, I do not want to be married.Not until I have
grown up, and seen something of the world.You know it is one of my
dearest wishes to be self-supporting, not because I am a Feminist or a
new woman, or have 'the unnatural belief of an antipathy to man' that
you're always talking about, but just because it will prove to me once
and for all that I belong to myself, and that my _soul_ isn't, and
never has been cooperative.You know what I mean by this, and you are
not hurt by my feeling so.You, I am sure, would not want me to be
married, or to have to think of myself as engaged, especially not to
anybody that we all knew and loved, and who is very close to me and
you in quite another way.Please don't try to imagine what I mean,
Uncle Peter--even if you know, you must tell yourself that you don't
know.Please, please pretend even to yourself that I haven't written
you this letter.I know people do tell things like this, but I don't
know quite how they bring themselves to do it, even if they have
somebody like you who understands everything--everything."Uncle Peter, dear, I am supposed to be going to be married by and by
when the one who wants it feels that it can be spoken of, and until
that happens, I've got to wait for him to speak, unless I can find
some way to tell him that I do not want it ever to be.I don't know
how to tell him.I don't know how to make him feel that I do not
belong to him.It is only myself I belong to, and I belong to you, but
I don't know how to make that plain to any one who does not know it
already.I can't say it unless perhaps you can help me to.I know every girl always thinks
there is something different about her, but I think there are ways in
which I truly am different.When I want anything I know more clearly
what it is, and why I want it than most other girls do, and not only
that, but I know now, that I want to keep myself, and everything I
think and feel and am,--_sacred_.There is an inner shrine in a
woman's soul that she must keep inviolate."A liberty that you haven't known how, or had the strength to prevent,
is a terrible thing.Uncle Peter, dear, twice in
my life things have happened that drive me almost desperate when I
think of them.If these things should happen again when I know that I
don't want them to, I don't think there would be any way of my bearing
it.Perhaps you can tell me something that will make me find a way out
of this tangle.I don't see what it could be, but lots of times you
have shown me the way out of endless mazes that were not grown up
troubles like this, but seemed very real to me just the same."Uncle Peter, dear, dear, dear,--you are all I have.I wish you were
here to-night, though you wouldn't be let in, even if you beat on the
gate ever so hard, for it's long after bedtime.I am up in my tower
room all alone.*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor read her letter over and addressed a tear splotched envelope
to Peter.Then she slowly tore letter and envelope into little bits."He would know," she said to herself."I haven't any real right to
tell him.It would be just as bad as any kind of tattling."She began another letter to him but found she could not write without
saying what was in her heart, and so went to bed uncomforted.There
was nothing in her experience to help her in her relation to David.His kiss on her lips had taught her the nature of such kisses: had
made her understand suddenly the ease with which the strange, sweet
spell of sex is cast.She related it to the episode of the unwelcome
caress bestowed upon her by the brother of Maggie Lou, and that half
forgotten incident took on an almost terrible significance.She
understood now how she should have repelled that unconscionable boy,
but that understanding did not help her with the problem of her Uncle
David.Though the thought of it thrilled through her with a strange
incredible delight, she did not want another kiss of his upon her
lips."It's--it's--like that," she said to herself."I want it to be from
somebody--else.Somebody that would make it
seem right."She felt that she
must get upon her own feet quickly and be under no obligation to any
man.Vaguely her stern New England rearing was beginning to indicate
the way that she should tread.No man or woman who did not understand
"the value of a dollar," was properly equipped to do battle with the
realities of life.The value of a dollar, and a clear title to
it--these were the principles upon which her integrity must be founded
if she were to survive her own self-respect.Her Puritan fathers had
bestowed this heritage upon her.She had always felt the irregularity
of her economic position; now that the complication of her relation
with David had arisen, it was beginning to make her truly
uncomfortable.David had been very considerate of her, but his consideration
frightened her.He had been so afraid that she might be hurt or
troubled by his attitude toward her that he had explained again, and
almost in so many words that he was only waiting for her to grow
accustomed to the idea before he asked her to become his wife.She had
looked forward with considerable trepidation to the Easter vacation
following the establishment of their one-sided understanding, but
David relieved her apprehension by putting up at his club and leaving
her in undisturbed possession of his quarters.There, with
Mademoiselle still treating her as a little girl, and the other five
of her heterogeneous foster family to pet and divert her at intervals,
she soon began to feel her life swing back into a more accustomed and
normal perspective.David's attitude to her was as simple as ever, and
when she was with the devoted sextet she was almost able to forget the
matter that was at issue between them--almost but not quite.She took quite a new kind of delight in her association with the
group.She found herself suddenly on terms of grown up equality with
them.Her consciousness of the fact that David was tacitly waiting
for her to become a woman, had made a woman of her already, and she
looked on her guardians with the eyes of a woman, even though a very
newly fledged and timorous one.She was a trifle self-conscious with the others, but with Jimmie she
was soon on her old familiar footing.*       *       *       *       *

"Uncle Jimmie is still a great deal of fun," she wrote in her diary."He does just the same old things he used to do with me, and a good
many new ones in addition.He brings me flowers, and gets me taxi-cabs
as if I were really a grown up young lady, and he pinches my nose and
teases me as if I were still the little girl that kept house in a
studio for him.I never realized before what a good-looking man he is.I used to think that Uncle Peter was the only handsome man of the
three, but now I realize that they are all exceptionally good-looking.Uncle David has a great deal of distinction, of course, but Uncle
Jimmie is merry and radiant and vital, and tall and athletic looking
into the bargain.The ladies on the Avenue all turn to look at him
when we go walking.He says that the gentlemen all turn to look at
me, and I think perhaps they do when I have my best clothes on, but in
my school clothes I am quite certain that nothing like that happens."I have been out with Uncle Jimmie Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday
and Friday,--four days of my vacation.We've been to the Hippodrome
and Chinatown, and we've dined at Sherry's, and one night we went down
to the little Italian restaurant where I had my first introduction to
_eau rougie_, and was so distressed about it.I shall never forget
that night, and I don't think Uncle Jimmie will ever be done teasing
me about it.It is nice to be with Uncle Jimmie so much, but I never
seem to see Uncle Peter any more.Alphonse is very careful about
taking messages, I know, but it does seem to me that Uncle Peter must
have telephoned more times than I know of.It does seem as if he
would, at least, try to see me long enough to have one of our old time
talks again.To see him with all the others about is only a very
little better than not seeing him at all.He isn't like himself,
someway.There is a shadow over him that I do not understand."*       *       *       *       *

"Don't you think that Uncle Peter has changed?"she asked Jimmie,
when the need of speaking of him became too strong to withstand."He is a little pale about the ears," Jimmie conceded, "but I think
that's the result of hard work and not enough exercise.He spends all
his spare time trying to patch up Beulah instead of tramping and
getting out on his horse the way he used to.He's doing a good job on
the old dear, but it's some job, nevertheless and notwithstanding--"

"Is Aunt Beulah feeling better than she was?"Eleanor's lips were dry,
but she did her best to make her voice sound natural.It seemed
strange that Jimmie could speak so casually of a condition of affairs
that made her very heart stand still."I didn't know that Uncle Peter
had been taking care of her.""Taking care of her isn't a circumstance to what Peter has been doing
for Beulah.You know she hasn't been right for some time.She got
burning wrong, like the flame on our old gas stove in the studio when
there was air in it.""Uncle David thought so the last time I was here," Eleanor said, "but
I didn't know that Uncle Peter--"

"Peter, curiously enough, was the last one to tumble.Dave and I got
alarmed about the girl and held a consultation, with the result that
Doctor Gramercy was called.If we'd believed he would go into it quite
so heavily we might have thought again before we sicked him on.It's
very nice for Mary Ann, but rather tough on Abraham as they said when
the lady was deposited on that already overcrowded bosom.Now Beulah's
got suffrage mania, and Peter's got Beulah mania, and it's a merry
mess all around."You haven't seen much of him since you came, have
you?--Well, the reason is that every afternoon as soon as he can get
away from the office, he puts on a broad sash marked 'Votes for
Women,' and trundles Beulah around in her little white and green
perambulator, trying to distract her mind from suffrage while he talks
to her gently and persuasively upon the subject.Suffrage is the only
subject on her mind, he explains, so all he can do is to try to cuckoo
gently under it day by day.It's a very complicated process but he's
making headway.""I'm glad of that," Eleanor said faintly."How--how is Aunt Gertrude?I don't see her very often, either."It was Jimmie's turn to look self-conscious."She never has time for me any more; I'm not high-brow enough for her.She's getting on like a streak, you know, exhibiting everywhere."She gave me a cast of her faun's head."She is, I guess, but don't let's waste all our valuable time talking
about the family.Let's talk about us--you and me.You ask me how I'm
feeling and then I'll tell you.Then I'll ask you how you're feeling
and you'll tell me.Then I'll tell you how I imagine you must be
feeling from the way you're looking,--and that will give me a chance
to expatiate on the delectability of your appearance.I'll work up
delicately to the point where you will begin to compare me favorably
with all the other nice young men you know,--and then we'll be off."Eleanor asked, beginning to sparkle a little."We shall indeed," he assured her solemnly.No, on second
thoughts, I'll begin.I'll begin at the place where I start telling
you how excessively well you're looking.I don't know, considering its
source, whether it would interest you or not, but you have the biggest
blue eyes that I've, ever seen in all my life,--and I'm rather a judge
of them.""All the better to eat you with, my dear," Eleanor chanted.He shot her a queer glance from under his eyebrows."I don't feel very safe when I look into them, my child.It would be a
funny joke on me if they did prove fatal to me, wouldn't
it?--well,--but away with such nonsense.I mustn't blither to the very
babe whose cradle I am rocking, must I?""I'm not a babe, Uncle Jimmie.Peter says
that you even disconcert him at times, when you take to remembering
things out of your previous experience.""'When he was a King in Babylon and I was a Christian Slave?'"Only I'd prefer to play the part of the King of Babylon, if
it's all the same to you, niecelet.How does the rest of it go, 'yet
not for a--' something or other 'would I wish undone that deed beyond
the grave.'Gosh, my dear, if things were otherwise, I think I could
understand how that feller felt.Get on your hat, and let's get out
into the open.My soul is cramped with big potentialities this
afternoon.I wish you hadn't grown up, Eleanor.You are taking my
breath away in a peculiar manner.No man likes to have his breath
taken away so suddint like.Let's get out into the rolling prairie of
Central Park."But the rest of the afternoon was rather a failure.The Park had that
peculiar bleakness that foreruns the first promise of spring.The
children, that six weeks before were playing in the snow and six weeks
later would be searching the turf for dandelions, were in the listless
between seasons state of comparative inactivity.There was a deceptive
balminess in the air that seemed merely to overlay a penetrating
chilliness."I'm sorry I'm not more entertaining this afternoon," Jimmie
apologized on the way home."It isn't that I am not happy, or that I
don't feel the occasion to be more than ordinarily propitious; I'm
silent upon a peak in Darien,--that's all.""I was thinking of something else, too," Eleanor said."I didn't say I was thinking of something else.""People are always thinking of something else when they aren't talking
to each other, aren't they?""Something else, or each other, Eleanor.I wasn't thinking of
something else, I was thinking--well, I won't tell you exactly--at
present."A penny is a good deal of money."I'm afraid I couldn't--buy joy, even if you gave me your penny, Uncle
Jimmie."My penny might not be like other pennies.On the other
hand, your thoughts might be worth a fortune to me.""I'm afraid they wouldn't be worth anything to anybody.""You simply don't know what I am capable of making out of them.""I wish I could make something out of them," Eleanor said so
miserably that Jimmie was filled with compunction for having tired her
out, and hailed a passing taxi in which to whiz her home again.*       *       *       *       *

"I have found out that Uncle Peter is spending all his time with Aunt
Beulah," she wrote in her diary that evening."It is beautiful of him
to try to help her through this period of nervous collapse, and just
like him, but I don't understand why it is that he doesn't come and
tell me about it, especially since he is getting so tired.He ought to
know that I love him so dearly and deeply that I could help him even
in helping her.It isn't like him not to share his anxieties with me.Aunt Beulah is a grown up woman, and has friends and doctors and
nurses, and every one knows her need.It seems to me that he might
think that I have no one but him, and that whatever might lie heavy on
my heart I could only confide in him.Why doesn't it occur to him that I might have something to
tell him now?He needs a good deal of exercise to
keep in form.If he doesn't have a certain amount of muscular
activity his digestion is not so good.There are two little creases
between his eyes that I never remember seeing there before.I asked
him the other night when he was here with Aunt Beulah if his head
ached, and he said 'no,' but Aunt Beulah said her head ached almost
all the time.Of course, Aunt Beulah is important, and if Uncle Peter
is trying to bring her back to normality again she is important to
him, and that makes her important to me for his sake also, but nobody
in the world is worth the sacrifice of Uncle Peter."I suppose it's a part of his great beauty that he should think so
disparagingly of himself.I might not love him so well if he knew just
how dear and sweet and great his personality is.It isn't so much what
he says or does, or even the way he looks that constitutes his charm,
it's the simple power and radiance behind his slightest move.He doesn't think he is especially fine or beautiful.He doesn't know what a waste it is when he spends his strength upon
somebody who isn't as noble in character as he is,--but I know, and it
makes me wild to think of it.My
vacation is almost over, and I don't see how I could bear going back
to school without one comforting hour of him alone."I intended to write a detailed account of my vacation, but I can not.Uncle Jimmie has certainly tried to make me happy.I could have so much fun with him if I were not worried about
Uncle Peter!"Uncle David says he wants to spend my last evening with me.We are
going to dine here, and then go to the theater together.I am going to
try to tell him how I feel about things, but I am afraid he won't give
me the chance.Life is a strange mixture of things you want and can't
have, and things you can have and don't want.It seems almost disloyal
to put that down on paper about Uncle David.I do want him and love
him, but oh!--not in that way.There is only one
person in a woman's life that she can feel that way about.Why--why--why doesn't my Uncle Peter come to me?"CHAPTER XX

THE MAKINGS OF A TRIPLE WEDDING


"Just by way of formality," David said, "and not because I think any
one present"--he smiled on the five friends grouped about his dinner
table--"still takes our old resolution seriously, I should like to be
released from the anti-matrimonial pledge that I signed eight years
ago this November.I have no announcement to make as yet, but when I
do wish to make an announcement--and I trust to have the permission
granted very shortly--I want to be sure of my technical right to do
so."Jimmie exclaimed in a tone of such genuine
confusion that it raised a shout of laughter."I never signed any pledge to that effect.""We left you out of it, Old Horse, regarding you as a congenital
celibate anyway," Jimmie answered."Some day soon you will understand how much you wronged me," Peter
said with a covert glance at Beulah."I wish I could say as much," Jimmie sighed, "since this is the hour
of confession I don't mind adding that I hope I may be able to soon."Gertrude clapped her hands softly."We've the makings of a triple
wedding in our midst.Look into the blushing faces before us and hear
the voice that breathed o'er Eden echoing in our ears.This is the
most exciting moment of my life!Girls, get on your feet and drink to
the health of these about-to-be Benedicts.Up in your chairs,--one
slipper on the table.Gertrude had seen Margaret's sudden pallor and heard the convulsive
catching of her breath,--Margaret rising Undine-like out of a filmy,
pale green frock, with her eyes set a little more deeply in the
shadows than usual.Her quick instinct to the rescue was her own
salvation."On behalf of my coadjutors," he said, "I thank you.All this is
extremely premature for me, and I imagine from the confusion of the
other gentlemen present it is as much, if not more so, for them.Personally I regret exceedingly being unable to take you more fully
into my confidence.The only reason for this partial revelation is
that I wished to be sure that I was honorably released from my oath of
abstinence.You fellows say something," he concluded,
sinking abruptly into his chair."Your style always was distinctly mid-Victorian," Jimmie murmured."I've got nothing to say, except that I wish I had something to say
and that if I _do_ have something to say in the near future I'll
create a real sensation!When Miss Van Astorbilt permits David to link
her name with his in the caption under a double column cut in our
leading journals, you'll get nothing like the thrill that I expect to
create with my modest announcement.I've got a real romance up my
sleeve."There is no Van Astorbilt in mine.""The lady won't give me her permission to speak," Peter said."She
knows how proud and happy I shall be when I am able to do so.""It is better we should marry," she said."I didn't realize that when
I exacted that oath from you.It is from the intellectual type that
the brains to carry on the great work of the world must be
inherited."I'll destroy it to-night and then we may all consider
ourselves free to take any step that we see fit.It was really only as
a further protection to Eleanor that we signed it.""Eleanor will be surprised, won't she?"Three
self-conscious masculine faces met her innocent interrogation."_Eleanor_," Margaret breathed, "_Eleanor_.""I rather think she will," Jimmie chuckled irresistibly, but David
said nothing, and Peter stared unseeingly into the glass he was still
twirling on its stem."Eleanor will be taken care of just the same," Beulah said decisively."I don't think we need even go through the formality of a vote on
that.""Eleanor will be taken care of," David said softly.The Hutchinsons' limousine--old Grandmother Hutchinson had a motor
nowadays--was calling for Margaret, and she was to take the two other
girls home.David and Jimmie--such is the nature of men--were
disappointed in not being able to take Margaret and Gertrude
respectively under their accustomed protection."I wanted to talk to you, Gertrude," Jimmie said reproachfully as she
slipped away from his ingratiating hand on her arm."I thought I should take you home to-night, Margaret," David said;
"you never gave me the slip before.""The old order changeth," Gertrude replied lightly to them both, as
she preceded Margaret into the luxurious interior."It's Eleanor," Gertrude announced as the big car swung into Fifth
Avenue."Jimmie or David--or--or both are going to marry Eleanor.Didn't you
see their faces when Beulah spoke of her?""David wants to marry Eleanor," Margaret said quietly."I've known it
all winter--without realizing what it was I knew.""Well, who is Jimmy going to marry then?""Who is Peter going to marry for that matter?"it doesn't make any difference,--we're losing them just the same.""No matter what combinations come
about, we shall still have an indestructible friendship.""Indestructible friendship--shucks," Gertrude cried."The boys are
going to be married--married--married!Marriage is the one thing that
indestructible friendships don't survive--except as ghosts.""It should be Peter who is going to marry Eleanor," Margaret said."It's Peter who has always loved her best."As a friend," Beulah said, "as her dearest friend.""Not as a friend," Margaret answered softly, "she loves him."I believe it," Gertrude said.Of
course, it must be Peter who is going to marry her.""If it isn't we've succeeded in working out a rather tragic
experiment," Margaret said, "haven't we?""Life is a tragic experiment for any woman," Gertrude said
sententiously."Peter doesn't intend to marry Eleanor," Beulah persisted."Do you happen to know who he is going to marry?""Yes, I do know, but I--I can't tell you yet.""Whoever it is, it's a mistake," Margaret said."It's our little
Eleanor he wants.I suppose he doesn't realize it himself yet, and
when he does it will be too late.He's probably gone and tied himself
up with somebody entirely unsuitable, hasn't he, Beulah?""I don't know," Beulah said; "perhaps he has.I hadn't thought of it
that way.""It's the way to think of it, I know."Margaret's eyes filled with
sudden tears."But whatever he's done it's past mending now.There'll
be no question of Peter's backing out of a bargain--bad or good, and
our poor little kiddie's got to suffer.""Beulah took it hard," Gertrude commented, as they turned up-town
again after dropping their friend at her door.The two girls were
spending the night together at Margaret's.I think besides being devoted to Eleanor, she feels terrifically
responsible for her.I can't pretend to think of anything else,--who--who--who--are
our boys going to marry?""I don't know, Gertrude.""I always thought that you and David--"

Margaret met her eyes bravely but she did not answer the implicit
question."I always thought that you and Jimmie--" she said presently.Gertrude, you would have been so good for him."it's all over now," Gertrude said, "but I didn't know that a
living soul suspected me."Gertrude whispered as they clung to each
other.I've never seen any one else whom I thought that of.I--I was so
used to him.""That's the rub," Gertrude said, "we're so used to them.They're
so--so preposterously necessary to us."Late that night clasped in each other's arms they admitted the extent
of their desolation.Life had been robbed of a magic,--a mystery.The
solid friendship of years of mutual trust and understanding was the
background of so much lovely folly, so many unrealized possibilities,
so many nebulous desires and dreams that the sudden dissolution of
their circle was an unthinkable calamity."We ought to have put out our hands and taken them if we wanted them,"
Gertrude said, out of the darkness.They need to be firmly
turned in the right direction instead of being given their heads."I wouldn't pay that price for love," Margaret said.By
the time I had made it happen I wouldn't want it.""That's my trouble too," Gertrude said.Then she turned over on her
pillow and sobbed helplessly."Jimmie had such ducky little curls,"
she explained incoherently."I do this sometimes when I think of them.Margaret put out a hand to her; but long after Gertrude's breath began
to rise and fall regularly, she lay staring wide-eyed into the
darkness.CHAPTER XXI

ELEANOR HEARS THE NEWS


"Dear Uncle Jimmie:

"I said I would write you, but now that I have taken this hour in
which to do it, I find it is a very, very hard letter that I have got
to write.In the first place I can't believe that the things you said
to me that night were real, or that you were awake and in the world of
realities when you said them.I felt as if we were both dreaming; that
you were talking as a man does sometimes in delirium when he believes
the woman he loves to be by his side, and I was listening the same
way.It made me very happy, as dreams sometimes do.I can't help
feeling that your idea of me is a dream idea, and the pain that you
said this kind of a letter would give you will be merely dream pain.It is a shock to wake up in the morning and find that all the lovely
ways we felt, and delicately beautiful things we had, were only dream
things that we wouldn't even understand if we were thoroughly awake."In the second place, you can't want to marry your little niecelet,
the funny little 'kiddo,' that used to burn her fingers and the
beefsteak over that old studio gas stove.We had such lovely kinds of
make-believe together.That's what our association always ought to
mean to us,--just chumship, and wonderful and preposterous _pretends_.I couldn't think of myself being married to you any more than I could
Jack the giant killer, or Robinson Crusoe.You're my truly best and
dearest childhood's playmate, and that is a great deal to be, Uncle
Jimmie.I don't think a little girl ever grows up quite _whole_ unless
she has somewhere, somehow, what I had in you.You wouldn't want to
marry Alice in Wonderland, now would you?There are some kinds of
playmates that can't marry each other.I think that you and I are that
kind, Uncle Jimmie."My dear, my dear, don't let this hurt you.How can it hurt you, when
I am only your little adopted foster child that you have helped
support and comfort and make a beautiful, glad life for?I love you so
much,--you are so precious to me that you _must_ wake up out of this
distorted, though lovely dream that I was present at!Nobody can break our hearts if we are strong
enough to withhold them.Nobody can hurt us too much if we can find
the way to be our bravest all the time.I know that what you are
feeling now is not real.I can't tell you how I know, but I do know
the difference.They could be pulled up
without too terrible a havoc."Uncle Jimmie, dear, believe me, believe me.I said this would be a
hard letter to write, and it has been.If you could see my poor
inkstained, weeping face, you would realize that I am only your funny
little Eleanor after all, and not to be taken seriously at all.I hope
you will come up for my graduation.When you see me with all the other
lumps and frumps that are here, you will know that I am not worth
considering except as a kind of human joke."Good-by, dear, my dear, and God bless you.*       *       *       *       *

It was less than a week after this letter to Jimmie that Margaret
spending a week-end in a town in Connecticut adjoining that in which
Eleanor's school was located, telephoned Eleanor to join her
overnight at the inn where she was staying.She had really planned the
entire expedition for the purpose of seeing Eleanor and preparing her
for the revelations that were in store for her, though she was
ostensibly meeting a motoring party, with which she was going on into
the Berkshires.She started in abruptly, as was her way, over the salad and cheese in
the low studded Arts and Crafts dining-room of the fashionable road
house, contrived to look as self-conscious as a pretty woman in new
sporting clothes."Your Uncle David and your Uncle Jimmie are going to be married," she
told her."No, I didn't," Eleanor said faintly, but she grew suddenly very
white.David gave a dinner party one night last
week in his studio, and announced his intentions, but we don't know
the name of the lady yet, and we can't guess it.He says it is not a
society girl.""Who do you think it is, Eleanor?""I--I can't think, Aunt Margaret.""We don't know who Jimmie is marrying either.The facts were merely
insinuated, but he said we should have the shock of our lives when we
knew.""Perhaps he has changed his mind by now," Eleanor said.Don't you think it might be that they both just
thought they were going to marry somebody--that really doesn't want to
marry them?It might be all a mistake, you know.""I don't think it's a mistake.Margaret found the rest of her story harder to tell than she had
anticipated.Eleanor, wrapped in the formidable aloofness of the
sensitive young, was already suffering from the tale she had come to
tell,--why, it was not so easy to determine.It might be merely from
the pang of being shut out from confidences that she felt should have
been shared with her at once.She waited until they were both ready for bed (their rooms were
connecting)--Eleanor in the straight folds of her white dimity
nightgown, and her two golden braids making a picture that lingered in
Margaret's memory for many years."It would have been easier to tell
her in her street clothes," she thought."I wish her profile were not
so perfect, or her eyes were shallower.How can I hurt such a lovely
thing?""Are the ten Hutchinsons all right?""The ten Hutchinsons are very much all right.They like me better now
that I have grown a nice hard Hutchinson shell that doesn't show my
feelings through.Haven't you noticed how much more like other people
I've grown, Eleanor?""You've grown nicer, and dearer and sweeter, but I don't think you're
very much like anybody else, Aunt Margaret.""I have though,--every one notices it.You haven't asked me anything
about Peter yet," she added suddenly.The lovely color glowed in Eleanor's cheeks for an instant."I haven't heard from him for a
long time.""Yes, he's well," Margaret said."He's looking better than he was for
a while.He had some news to tell us too, Eleanor."He
said that he hadn't the consent of the lady to mention her name yet.We're as much puzzled about him as we are about the other two.""It's Aunt Beulah," Eleanor said.She sat upright on the edge of the bed and stared straight ahead of
her.Margaret watched the light and life and youth die out of the face
and a pitiful ashen pallor overspread it."I don't think it's Beulah," Margaret said."Beulah knows who it is,
but I never thought of it's being Beulah herself.""If she knows--then she's the one.He wouldn't have told her first if
she hadn't been.""Don't let it hurt you too much, dear.Gertrude--and me, too, Eleanor.It's--it's pain to us all.""Do you mean--Uncle David, Aunt Margaret?""Yes, dear," Margaret smiled at her bravely."And does Aunt Gertrude care about Uncle Jimmie?""She has for a good many years, I think.""I didn't know that," she said.She
pushed Margaret's arm away from her gently, but her breath came hard."Don't touch me," she cried, "I can't bear it.You might not want
to--if you knew.As Margaret closed the door gently between them, she saw Eleanor throw
her head back, and push the back of her hand hard against her mouth,
as if to stifle the rising cry of her anguish.*       *       *       *       *

The next morning Eleanor was gone.Margaret had listened for hours in
the night but had heard not so much as the rustle of a garment from
the room beyond.Toward morning she had fallen into the sleep of
exhaustion.It was then that the stricken child had made her escape."Miss Hamlin had found that she must take the early train," the clerk
said, "and left this note for Miss Hutchinson."It was like Eleanor to
do things decently and in order.*       *       *       *       *

"Dear Aunt Margaret," her letter ran."My grandmother used to say that
some people were trouble breeders.On thinking it over I am afraid
that is just about what I am,--a trouble breeder."I've been a worry and bother and care to you all since the beginning,
and I have repaid all your kindness by bringing trouble upon you.I don't think I have any right to
tell you exactly in this letter.I can only pray that it will be found
to be all a mistake, and come out right in the end.Surely such
beautiful people as you and Uncle David can find the way to each
other, and can help Uncle Jimmie and Aunt Gertrude, who are a little
blinder about life.Surely, when the stumbling block is out of the
way, you four will walk together beautifully.Please try, Aunt
Margaret, to make things as right as if I had never helped them to go
wrong.I was so young, I didn't know how to manage.I shall never be
that kind of young again."You know the other reason why I am going.Please do not let any one
else know.If the others could think I had met with some accident,
don't you think that would be the wisest way?I would like to arrange
it so they wouldn't try to find me at all, but would just mourn for me
naturally for a little while.I thought of sticking my old cap in the
river, but I was afraid that would be too hard for you.There won't be
any use in trying to find me.I couldn't
ever bear seeing one of your faces again.Don't let Uncle Peter _know_, please, Aunt Margaret.I don't want him
to know,--I don't want to hurt him, and I don't want him to know.Good-by, my dears, my dearests.I
have taken all of my allowance money.CHAPTER XXII

THE SEARCH


Eleanor had not bought a ticket at the station, Margaret ascertained,
but the ticket agent had tried to persuade her to.She had thanked him
and told him that she preferred to buy it of the conductor.He was a
lank, saturnine individual and had been seriously smitten with
Eleanor's charms, it appeared, and the extreme solicitousness of his
attitude at the suggestion of any mystery connected with her departure
made Margaret realize the caution with which it would be politic to
proceed.She had very little hope of finding Eleanor back at the
school, but it was still rather a shock when she telephoned the school
office and found that there was no news of her there.She concocted a
somewhat lame story to account for Eleanor's absence and promised the
authorities that she would be sent back to them within the week,--a
promise she was subsequently obliged to acknowledge that she could not
keep.Then she fled to New York to break the disastrous news to the
others.She told Gertrude the truth and showed her the pitiful letter Eleanor
had left behind her, and together they wept over it.Also together,
they faced David and Jimmie."She went away," Margaret told them, "both because she felt she was
hurting those that she loved and because she herself was hurt.""I mean--that she belonged body and soul to Peter and to nobody else,"
Margaret answered deliberately."If that is true," he said, "then I am largely responsible for her
going.""It is I who am responsible," Jimmie groaned aloud."I asked her to
marry me and she refused me.""I asked her to marry me and didn't give her the chance to refuse,"
David said; "it is that she is running away from.""It was Peter's engagement that was the last straw," Margaret said."The poor baby withered and shrank like a flower in the blast when I
told her that.""The damned hound--" Jimmie said feelingly and without apology."Eleanor says it's Beulah, and the more I think of it the more I think
that she's probably right.""That would be a nice mess, wouldn't it?""Remember how frank we were with her about his probable lack of
judgment, Margaret?I don't covet the sweet job of breaking it to
either one of them."Nevertheless she assisted Margaret to break it to them both late that
same afternoon at Beulah's apartment."I'll find her," Peter said briefly.And in response to the halting
explanation of her disappearance that Margaret and Gertrude had done
their best to try to make plausible, despite its elliptical nature, he
only said, "I don't see that it makes any difference why she's gone.She's gone, that's the thing that's important.No matter how hard we
try we can't really figure out her reason till we find her.""Are you sure it's going to be so easy?"She's a pretty determined little person when she
makes up her mind.Eleanor's threats are to be taken seriously."I'll find her if she's anywhere in the world," Peter said."I'll find
her and bring her back.""I believe that you will," she said."Find out the reason that she
went away, too, Peter."Beulah pulled Gertrude aside."She had some one else
on her mind, hadn't she?""She had something else on her mind," Gertrude answered gravely, "but
she had Peter on her mind, too.""She didn't--she couldn't have known about us--Peter and me.We--we
haven't told any one."It's
just one of God's most satirical mix-ups.""I was to blame," Beulah said slowly."I don't believe in shifting
responsibility.I got her here in the first place and I've been
instrumental in guiding her life ever since.Now, I've sacrificed her
to my own happiness.""It isn't so simple as that," Gertrude said; "the things we start
going soon pass out of our hands.Somebody a good deal higher up has
been directing Eleanor's affairs for a long time,--and ours too, for
that matter.""Don't worry, Beulah," Peter said, making his way to her side from the
other corner of the room where he had been talking to Margaret."You
mustn't let this worry you.We've all got to be--soldiers now,--but
we'll soon have her back again, I promise you.""And I promise you," Beulah said chokingly, "that if you'll get her
back again, I--I will be a soldier."*       *       *       *       *

Peter began by visiting the business schools in New York and finding
out the names of the pupils registered there.Eleanor had clung firmly
to her idea of becoming an editorial stenographer in some magazine
office, no matter how hard he had worked to dissuade her.He felt
almost certain she would follow out that purpose now.There was a fund
in her name started some years before for the defraying of her college
expenses.She would use that, he argued, to get herself started, even
though she felt constrained to pay it back later on.He worked on this
theory for some time, even making a trip to Boston in search for her
in the stenography classes there, but nothing came of it.Among Eleanor's effects sent on from the school was a little red
address book containing the names and addresses of many of her former
schoolmates at Harmon.Peter wrote all the girls he remembered hearing
her speak affectionately of, but not one of them was able to give him
any news of her.He wrote to Colhassett to Albertina's aunt, who had
served in the capacity of housekeeper to Eleanor's grandfather in his
last days, and got in reply a pious letter from Albertina herself, who
intimated that she had always suspected that Eleanor would come to
some bad end, and that now she was highly soothed and gratified by the
apparent fulfillment of her sinister prognostications.Later he tried private detectives, and, not content with their
efforts, he followed them over the ground that they covered, searching
through boarding houses, and public classes of all kinds; canvassing
the editorial offices of the various magazines Eleanor had admired in
the hope of discovering that she had applied for some small position
there; following every clue that his imagination, and the acumen of
the professionals in his service, could supply;--but his patient
search was unrewarded.Eleanor had apparently vanished from the
surface of the earth.The quest which had seemed to him so simple a
matter when he first undertook it, now began to assume terrible and
abortive proportions.It was unthinkable that one little slip of a
girl untraveled and inexperienced should be able permanently to elude
six determined and worldly adult New Yorkers, who were prepared to tax
their resources to the utmost in the effort to find her,--but the fact
remained that she was missing and continued to be missing, and the
cruel month went by and brought them no news of her.Apart from the emotions
that had been precipitated by her developing charms, they loved her
dearly as the child they had taken to their hearts and bestowed all
their young enthusiasm and energy and tenderness upon.She was the
living clay, as Gertrude had said so many years before, that they had
molded as nearly as possible to their hearts' desire.They loved her
for herself, but one and all they loved her for what they had made of
her--an exquisite, lovely young creature, at ease in a world that
might so easily have crushed her utterly if they had not intervened
for her.They kept up the search unremittingly, following false leads and
meeting with heartbreaking discouragements and disappointments.Only
Margaret had any sense of peace about her."I'm sure she's all right," she said; "I feel it.It's hard having her
gone, but I'm not afraid for her.She'll work it out better than we
could help her to.It's a beautiful thing to be young and strong and
free, and she'll get the beauty out of it.""I think perhaps you're right, Margaret," David said.It's the bread and butter end of the problem that worries
me.""He'll provide for our ewe lamb, I'm
sure.""You speak as if you had it on direct authority.""I think perhaps I have," she said gravely.Jimmie and Gertrude grew closer together as the weeks passed, and the
strain of their fruitless quest continued.One day Jimmie showed her
the letter that Eleanor had written him.he said, as Gertrude returned it to him, smiling
through her tears."She's a darling," Gertrude said fervently."Did she hurt you so much,
Jimmie dear?""I wanted her," Jimmie answered slowly, "but I think it was because I
thought she was mine,--that I could make her mine.When I found she
was Peter's,--had been Peter's all the time, the thought somehow cured
me.I made it up out of the stuff that
dreams are made of.God knows I love her, but--but that personal thing
has gone out of it.She's my little lost child,--or my sister.A man
wants his own to be his own, Gertrude.""My--my real trouble is that I'm at sea again.I thought that I
cared,--that I was anchored for good.It's the drifting that plays the
deuce with me.If the thought of that sweet child and the grief at her
loss can't hold me, what can?"I don't know," Gertrude laughed.You've always been on to me, Gertrude, too much so
to have any respect for me, I guess.You've got your work," he waved
his arm at the huge cast under the shadow of which they were sitting,
"and all this.You can put all your human longings into it.I'm a poor
rudderless creature without any hope or direction.""You don't know it," he said, with an effort to conceal
the fact that his shoulders were shaking, "but you see before you a
human soul in the actual process of dissolution."Gertrude crossed her studio floor to kneel down beside him.She drew
the boyish head, rumpled into an irresistible state of curliness, to
her breast."Put it here where it belongs," she said softly."I snitched him," Gertrude confided to Margaret some days later,--her
whole being radiant and transfigured with happiness.CHAPTER XXIII

THE YOUNG NURSE


The local hospital of the village of Harmonville, which was ten miles
from Harmon proper, where the famous boarding-school for young ladies
was located, presented an aspect so far from institutional that but
for the sign board tacked modestly to an elm tree just beyond the
break in the hedge that constituted the main entrance, the gracious,
old colonial structure might have been taken for the private residence
for which it had served so many years.It was a crisp day in late September, and a pale yellow sun was spread
thin over the carpet of yellow leaves with which the wide lawn was
covered.In the upper corridor of the west wing, grouped about the
window-seat with their embroidery or knitting, the young nurses were
talking together in low tones during the hour of the patients'
siestas.The two graduates, dark-eyed efficient girls, with skilled
delicate fingers taking precise stitches in the needlework before
them, were in full uniform, but the younger girls clustered about
them, beginners for the most part, but a few months in training, were
dressed in the simple blue print, and little white caps and aprons, of
the probationary period.A light breeze blew in at
the window and stirred a straying lock or two that escaped the
starched band of a confining cap.Outside the stinging whistle of the
insect world was interrupted now and then by the cough of a passing
motor.From the doors opening on the corridor an occasional restless
moan indicated the inability of some sufferer to take his dose of
oblivion according to schedule.Presently a bell tinkled a summons to
the patient in the first room on the right--a gentle little old lady
who had just had her appendix removed."Will you take that, Miss Hamlin?"the nurse in charge of the case
asked the tallest and fairest of the young assistants.Eleanor, demure in cap and kerchief as the most ravishing
of young Priscillas, rose obediently at the request."May I read to
her a little if she wants me to?""Yes, if you keep the door closed.I think most of the others are
sleeping."The little old lady who had just had her appendix out, smiled weakly
up at Eleanor."I hoped 'twould be you," she said, "and then after I'd rung I lay in
fear and trembling lest one o' them young flipperti-gibbets should
come, and get me all worked up while she was trying to shift me.I
want to be turned the least little mite on my left side."Eleanor asked, as she made the adjustment."I dunno whether that's better, or whether it just seems better to me,
because 'twas you that fixed me," the little old lady said."You
certainly have got a soothin' and comfortin' way with you.""I used to take care of my grandmother years ago, and the more
hospital work I do, the more it comes back to me,--and the better I
remember the things that she liked to have done for her.""There's nobody like your own kith and kin," the little old lady
sighed.That other nurse--that black
haired one--she said you was an orphan, alone in the world.Well, I
pity a young girl alone in the world.""It's all right to be alone in the world--if you just keep busy
enough," Eleanor said."But you mustn't talk any more.I'm going to
give you your medicine and then sit here and read to you."*       *       *       *       *

On the morning of her flight from the inn, after a night spent staring
motionless into the darkness, Eleanor took the train to the town some
dozen miles beyond Harmonville, where her old friend Bertha Stephens
lived.To "Stevie," to whom the duplicity of Maggie Lou had served to
draw her very close in the ensuing year, she told a part of her story.Stephens, whose husband was on
the board of directors of the Harmonville hospital, that Eleanor had
been admitted there.She had resolutely put all her old life behind
her.The plan to take up a course in stenography and enter an
editorial office was to have been, as a matter of course, a part of
her life closely associated with Peter.Losing him, there was nothing
left of her dream of high adventure and conquest.There was merely the
hurt desire to hide herself where she need never trouble him again,
and where she could be independent and useful.Having no idea of her
own value to her guardians, or the integral tenderness in which she
was held, she sincerely believed that her disappearance must have
relieved them of much chagrin and embarrassment.She had the
temperament that finds a virtue in the day's work, and a balm in its
mere iterative quality.Her sympathy and intelligence made her a good
nurse and her adaptability, combined with her loveliness, a general
favorite.She spent her days off at the Stephens' home.Bertha Stephens had been
the one girl that Peter had failed to write to, when he began to
circulate his letters of inquiry.Her name had been set down in the
little red book, but he remembered the trouble that Maggie Lou had
precipitated, and arrived at the conclusion that the intimacy existing
between Eleanor and Bertha had not survived it.Except that Carlo
Stephens persisted in trying to make love to her, and Mrs.Stephens
covertly encouraged his doing so, Eleanor found the Stephens' home a
very comforting haven.Bertha had developed into a full breasted,
motherly looking girl, passionately interested in all vicarious
love-affairs, though quickly intimidated at the thought of having any
of her own.She was devoted to Eleanor, and mothered her clumsily.It was still to her diary that Eleanor turned for the relief and
solace of self-expression.*       *       *       *       *

"It is five months to-day," she wrote, "since I came to the hospital.I like it, but I feel like the little old
woman on the King's Highway.I doubt more every minute if this can be
I. Sometimes I wonder what 'being I' consists of, anyway.I used to
feel as if I were divided up into six parts as separate as
protoplasmic cells, and that each one was looked out for by a
different cooperative parent.I thought that I would truly be I when I
got them all together, and looked out for them myself, but I find I am
no more of an entity than I ever was.The puzzling question of 'what
am I?'still persists, and I am farther away from the right answer
than ever.Would a sound be a sound if there were no one to hear it?If the waves of vibration struck no human ear, would the sound be in
existence at all?This is the problem propounded by one of the nurses
yesterday."How much of us lives when we are entirely shut out of the
consciousness of those whom we love?If there is no one to _realize_
us day by day,--if all that love has made of us is taken away, what is
left?I look in the glass, and see
the same face,--Eleanor Hamlin, almost nineteen, with the same bow
shaped eyebrows, and the same double ridge leading up from her nose to
her mouth, making her look still very babyish.I pinch myself, and
find that it hurts just the same as it used to six months ago, but
there the resemblance to what I used to be, stops.I'm a young nurse
now in hospital training, and very good at it, too, if I do say it as
shouldn't; but that's all I am.Otherwise, I'm not anybody _to_
anybody,--except a figure of romance to good old Stevie, who doesn't
count in this kind of reckoning.I take naturally to nursing they tell
me.A nurse is a kind of maternal automaton.I'm glad I'm that, but
there used to be a lot more of me than that.There ought to be some
heart and brain and soul left over, but there doesn't seem to be.Perhaps I am like the Princess in the fairy story whose heart was an
auk's egg.Nobody had power to make her feel unless they reached it
and squeezed it."I feel sometimes as if I were dead.I wish I could know whether Uncle
Peter and Aunt Beulah were married yet.There is a woman in this hospital whose suitor married some one else,
and she has nervous prostration, and melancholia.All she does all day
is to moan and wring her hands and call out his name.They seem to think that it is disgraceful to
love a man so much that your whole life stops as soon as he goes out
of it.What of Juliet and Ophelia and Francesca de Rimini?They loved
so they could not tear their love out of their hearts without
lacerating them forever.There is that kind of love in the
world,--bigger than life itself.All the big tragedies of literature
were made from it,--why haven't people more sympathy for it?Why isn't
there more dignity about it in the eyes of the world?"It is very unlucky to love, and to lose that which you cherish, but
it is unluckier still never to know the meaning of love, or to find
'Him whom your soul loveth.'I try to be kind to that poor forsaken
woman.I am sorry for his sake that she calls out his name, but she
seems to be in such torture of mind and body that she is unable to
help it."They are trying to cut down expenses here, so they have no regular
cook, the housekeeper and her helper are supposed to do it all.I said
I would make the desserts, so now I have got to go down-stairs and
make some fruit gelatin.It is best that I should not write any more
to-day, anyway."*       *       *       *       *

Later, after the Thanksgiving holiday, she wrote:

                  *       *       *       *       *

"I saw a little boy butchered to-day, and I shall never forget it.It
is wicked to speak of Doctor Blake's clean cut work as butchery, but
when you actually see a child's leg severed from its body, what else
can you call it?"The reason that I am able to go through operations without fainting
or crying is just this: _other people do_.The first time I stood by
the operating table to pass the sterilized instruments to the
assisting nurse, and saw the half naked doctors hung in rubber
standing there preparing to carve their way through the naked flesh of
the unconscious creature before them, I felt the kind of pang pass
through my heart that seems to kill as it comes.I thought I died, or
was dying,--and then I looked up and saw that every one else was ready
for their work.So I drew a deep breath and became ready too.I don't
think there is anything in the world too hard to do if you look at it
that way."The little boy loved me and I loved him.We had hoped against hope
that we would be able to save his poor little leg, but it had to go.I
held his hand while they gave him the chloroform.At his head sat
Doctor Hathaway with his Christlike face, draped in the robe of the
anesthetist.'Take long breaths, Benny,' I said, and he breathed in
bravely.To-morrow, when he is really out of the
ether, I have got to tell him what was done to him.Something happened
to me while that operation was going on.I think
the spirit of the one who was his mother passed into me, and I knew
what it would be like to be the mother of a son.Benny was not without
what his mother would have felt for him if she had been at his side.I can't explain it, but that is what I felt."To-night it is as black as ink outside.I feel as
if there should be no stars.If there were, there might be some
strange little bit of comfort in them that I could cling to.I do not
want any comfort from outside to shine upon me to-night.I have got to
draw all my strength from a source within, and I feel it welling up
within me even now."I wonder if I have been selfish to leave the people I love so long
without any word of me.I think Aunt Gertrude and Aunt Beulah and Aunt
Margaret all had a mother feeling for me.I am remembering to-night
how anxious they used to be for me to have warm clothing, and to keep
my feet dry, and not to work too hard at school.All those things that
I took as a matter of course, I realize now were very significant and
beautiful.If I had a child and did not know to-night where it would
lie down to sleep, or on what pillow it would put its head, I know my
own rest would be troubled.I wonder if I have caused any one of my
dear mothers to feel like that.If I have, it has been very wicked and
cruel of me."CHAPTER XXIV

CHRISTMAS AGAIN


The ten Hutchinsons having left the library entirely alone in the hour
before dinner, David and Margaret had appropriated it and were sitting
companionably together on the big couch drawn up before the fireplace,
where a log was trying to consume itself unscientifically head first."I would stay to dinner if urged," David suggested."You stay," Margaret agreed laconically.She moved away from him, relaxing rather limply in the corner of the
couch, with a hand dangling over the farther edge of it."You're an inconsistent being," David said."You buoy all the rest of
us up with your faith in the well-being of our child, and then you
pine yourself sick over her absence."We always had such a beautiful time on
Christmas.It isn't like
Christmas at all with her gone from us.""Do you remember how crazy she was over the ivory set?"David's eyes kindled at the
reminiscence.Margaret drew her feet up on the couch suddenly, and clasped her hands
about her knees."I haven't seen you do that for years," he said."I was just wondering--" but she stopped
herself suddenly.David was watching her narrowly, and perceiving it,
she flushed."This is not my idea of an interesting conversation," she said; "it's
getting too personal.""I can remember the time when you told me that you didn't find things
interesting unless they were personal.'I like things very personal,'
you said--in those words.""The chill wind of the world, I guess; the most personal part of me is
frozen stiff.""I never saw a warmer creature in my life," David protested."On that
same occasion you said that being a woman was about like being a field
of clover in an insectless world.You don't feel that way nowadays,
surely,--at the rate the insects have been buzzing around you this
winter.I've counted at least seven, three bees, one or two beetles, a
butterfly and a worm.""I didn't know you paid that much attention to my poor affairs."If you hadn't put your foot down firmly on the worm, I
had every intention of doing so.""On that occasion to which you refer I remember I also said that I had
a queer hunch about Eleanor.""Margaret, are you deliberately changing the subject?""Then I shall bring the butterfly up later.""I said," Margaret ignored his interruption, "that I had the feeling
that she was going to be a storm center and bring some kind of queer
trouble upon us.""I'm not so sure that's the way to put it," David said gravely."We
brought queer trouble on her.""She gave my vanity the worst blow it has ever had in its life," David
corrected her."Look here, Margaret, I want you to know the truth
about that.I--I stumbled into that, you know.She was so sweet, and
before I knew it I had--I found myself in the attitude of making love
to her.Well, there was nothing to do but go through with it.I felt like Pygmalion--but it was all potential,
unrealized--and ass that I was, I assumed that she would have no other
idea in the matter.I was going to marry her because I--I had started
things going, you know.I had no choice even if I had wanted one.It
never occurred to me that she might have a choice, and so I went on
trying to make things easy for her, and getting them more tangled at
every turn."With characteristic idiocy I was
keeping out of the picture until the time was ripe.She really ran
away to get away from the situation I created and she was quite right
too.If I weren't haunted by these continual pictures of our offspring
in the bread line, I should be rather glad than otherwise that she's
shaken us all till we get our breath back.Poor Peter is the one who
is smashed, though."You wouldn't smile if you were engaged to Beulah.""Beulah has her ring, but I notice she doesn't wear it often.""Jimmie and Gertrude seem happy.""That leaves only us two," David suggested."Margaret, dear, do you
think the time will ever come when I shall get you back again?"Margaret turned a little pale, but she met his look steadily."The answer to that is 'yes,' as you very well know.Time was when we
were very close--you and I, then somehow we lost the way to each
other.I'm beginning to realize that it hasn't been the same world
since and isn't likely to be unless you come back to me.""It was I; but it was you who put the bars up and have kept them
there.""Was I to let the bars down and wait at the gate?"It should be that way between us, Margaret, shouldn't
it?""I don't know," Margaret said, "I don't know."She flashed a sudden
odd look at him."If--when I put the bars down, I shall run for my
life."Warning is all I want," David said contentedly.He could barely reach
her hand across the intervening expanse of leather couch, but he
accomplished it,--he was too wise to move closer to her."You're a
lovely, lovely being," he said reverently."God grant I may reach you
and hold you.""To tell you the truth, she spoke of it the other day.I told her the
Eleanor story, and that rather brought her to her senses.She wouldn't
have liked that, you know; but now all the eligible buds are plucked,
and she wants me to settle down.""Does she think I'm a settling kind of person?""She wouldn't if she knew the way you go to my head," David murmured."Oh, she thinks that you'll do."Maybe I'd like them better considered as connections of yours,"
Margaret said abstractedly.David lifted the warm little finger to his lips and kissed it
swiftly.he asked, as she slipped away from him and
stood poised in the doorway."I'm going to put on something appropriate to the occasion," she
answered.When she came back to him she was wearing the most delicate and
cobwebby of muslins with a design of pale purple passion flowers
trellised all over it, and she gave him no chance for a moment alone
with her all the rest of the evening.Sometime later she showed him Eleanor's parting letter, and he was
profoundly touched by the pathetic little document.As the holidays approached Eleanor's absence became an almost
unendurable distress to them all.The annual Christmas dinner party, a
function that had never been omitted since the acquisition of David's
studio, was decided on conditionally, given up, and again decided on."We do want to see one another on Christmas day,--we've got presents
for one another, and Eleanor would hate it if she thought that her
going away had settled that big a cloud on us.She slipped out of our
lives in order to bring us closer together.We'll get closer together
for her sake," Margaret decided.But the ordeal of the dinner itself was almost more than they had
reckoned on.Every detail of traditional ceremony was observed even to
the mound of presents marked with each name piled on the same spot on
the couch, to be opened with the serving of the coffee."I got something for Eleanor," Jimmie remarked shamefacedly as he
added his contributions to the collection."Thought we could keep it
for her, or throw it into the waste-basket or something."I guess everybody else got her something, too," Margaret said."Of
course we will keep them for her.I got her a little French party
coat.It will be just as good next year as this.Anyhow as Jimmie
says, I had to get it.""I got her slipper buckles," Gertrude admitted."I got her the Temple _Shakespeare_," Beulah added."She was always
carrying around those big volumes.""You're looking better, Beulah," Margaret said."Jimmie says I'm looking more human.I guess perhaps that's it,--I'm
feeling more--human.I needed humanizing--even at the expense of
some--some heartbreak," she said bravely.Margaret crossed the room to take a seat on Beulah's chair-arm, and
slipped an arm around her."You're all right if you know that," she whispered softly."I thought I was going to bring you Eleanor herself," Peter said."I
got on the trail of a girl working in a candy shop out in Yonkers.My
faithful sleuth was sure it was Eleanor and I was ass enough to
believe he knew what he was talking about.When I got out there I
found a strawberry blonde with gold teeth.""Gosh, you don't think she's doing anything like that," Jimmie
exclaimed."I don't know," Peter said miserably.He was looking ill and unlike
himself.His deep set gray eyes were sunken far in his head, his brow
was too white, and the skin drawn too tightly over his jaws."As a
de-tec-i-tive, I'm afraid I'm a failure.""We're all failures for that matter," David said.Eleanor's empty place, set with the liqueur glass she always drank her
thimbleful of champagne in, and the throne chair from the drawing-room
in which she presided over the feasts given in her honor, was almost
too much for them.Peter shaded
his eyes with his hand, and Gertrude and Jimmie groped for each
other's hands under the shelter of the table-cloth."This--this won't do," David said.He turned to Beulah on his left,
sitting immovable, with her eyes staring unseeingly into the
centerpiece of holly and mistletoe arranged by Alphonse so lovingly."We must either turn this into a kind of a wake, and kneel as we
feast, or we must try to rise above it somehow.""I don't see why," Jimmie argued."I'm in favor of each man howling
informally as he listeth.""Let's drink her health anyhow," David insisted."I cut out the
Sauterne and the claret, so we could begin on the wine at once in this
contingency.Here's to our beloved and dear absent daughter.""Long may she wave," Jimmie cried, stumbling to his feet an instant
after the others.While they were still standing with their glasses uplifted, the bell
rang."Don't let anybody in, Alphonse," David admonished him.They all turned in the direction of the hall, but there was no sound
of parley at the front door.Eleanor had put a warning finger to her
lips, as Alphonse opened it to find her standing there.She stripped
off her hat and her coat as she passed through the drawing-room, and
stood in her little blue cloth traveling dress between the portieres
that separated it from the dining-room.The six stood transfixed at
the sight of her, not believing the vision of their eyes."You're drinking my health," she cried, as she stretched out her arms
to them.my dears, and my dearests, will you forgive me for
running away from you?"CHAPTER XXV

THE LOVER


They left her alone with Peter in the drawing room in the interval
before the coffee, seeing that he had barely spoken to her though his
eyes had not left her face since the moment of her spectacular
appearance between the portieres."I'm not going to marry you, Peter," Beulah whispered, as she slipped
by him to the door, "don't think of me.But Peter was almost past coherent thought or speech as they stood
facing each other on the hearth-rug,--Eleanor's little head up and her
breath coming lightly between her sweet, parted lips."How could you, dear--how could
you,--how could you?""I'm back all safe, now, Uncle Peter."I'm sorry I made you all that trouble," Eleanor said, "but I thought
it would be the best thing to do.""Tell me why," Peter said, "tell me why, I've suffered so
much--wondering--wondering.""I thought it was only I who did the
suffering."She moved a step nearer to him, and Peter gripped her hard by the
shoulders.Then his lips met hers dumbly,
beseechingly.*       *       *       *       *

"It was all a mistake,--my going away," she wrote some days after."I
ought to have stayed at the school, and graduated, and then come down
to New York, and faced things.I have my lesson now about facing
things.If any other crisis comes into my life, I hope I shall be as
strong as Dante was, when he'showed himself more furnished with
breath than he was,' and said, 'Go on, for I am strong and resolute.'I think we always have more strength than we understand ourselves to
have."I am so wonderfully happy about Uncle David and Aunt Margaret, and I
know Uncle Jimmie needs Aunt Gertrude and has always needed her.Did
my going away help those things to their fruition?"I can not bear to think of Aunt Beulah, but I know that I must bear
to think of her, and face the pain of having hurt her as I must face
every other thing that comes into my life from this hour.I would give
her back Peter, if I could,--but I can not.He is mine, and I am his,
and we have been that way from the beginning.I have thought of him
always as stronger and wiser than any one in the world, but I don't
think he is.He has suffered and stumbled along, trying blindly to do
right, hurting Aunt Beulah and mixing up his life like any man, just
the way Uncle Jimmie and Uncle David did."Don't men know who it is they love?They seem so often to be
struggling hungrily after the wrong thing, trying to get, or to make
themselves take, some woman that they do not really want.When women
love it is not like that with them.I think I have loved Peter from the first minute I
saw him, so beautiful and dear and sweet, with that _anxious_ look in
his eyes,--that look of consideration for the other person that is
always so much a part of him.He had it the first night I saw him,
when Uncle David brought me to show me to my foster parents for the
first time.It was the thing I grew up by, and measured men and their
attitude to women by--just that look in his eyes, that tender warm
look of consideration."It means a good many things, I think,--a gentle generous nature, and
a tender chivalrous heart.It means being a
good man, and one who _protects_ by sheer unselfish instinct.I don't
know how I shall ever heal him of the hurt he has done Aunt Beulah.Aunt Margaret tells me that Aunt Beulah's experience with him has been
the thing that has made her whole, that she needed to live through the
human cycle of emotion--of love and possession and renunciation before
she could be quite real and sound.This may be true, but it is not the
kind of reasoning for Peter and me to comfort ourselves with.If a
surgeon makes a mistake in cutting that afterwards does more good than
harm, he must not let that result absolve him from his mistake.Nothing can efface the mistake itself, and Peter and I must go on
feeling that way about it."I want to write something down about my love before I close this book
to-night.Something that I can turn to some day and read, or show to
my children when love comes to them.'This is the way I felt,' I want
to say to them, 'the first week of my love--this is what it meant to
me.'"It means being a greater, graver, and more beautiful person than you
ever thought you could be.It means knowing what you are, and what you
were meant to be all at once, and I think it means your chance to be
purified for the life you are to live, and the things you are to do in
it.Experience teaches, but I think love forecasts and points the way,
and shows you what you can be.Even if the light it sheds should grow
dim after a while, the path it has shown you should be clear to your
inner eye forever and ever.Having been in a great temple is a thing
to be better for all your life."It means that the soul and the things of the soul are
everlasting,--that they have got to be everlasting if love is like
this.Love between two people is more than the simple fact of their
being drawn together and standing hand in hand.It is the holy truth
about the universe.It is the rainbow of God's promise set over the
land.There comes with it the soul's certainty of living on and on
through time and space."Just my loving Peter and Peter's loving me isn't the important
thing,--the important thing is the way it has started the truth going;
my knowing and understanding mysterious laws that were sealed to me
before; Peter taking my life in his hands and making it consecrated
and true,--so true that I will not falter or suffer from any
misunderstandings or mistaken pain."It means warmth and light and tenderness, our love does, and all the
poetry in the world, and all the motherliness, (I feel so much like
his mother).When I say that he is not stronger or
wiser than any one in the world I mean--in living.I mean in the way
he behaves like a little bewildered boy sometimes.In loving he is
stronger and wiser than any living being.He takes my two hands in his
and gives me all the strength and all the wisdom and virtue there is
in the world."I haven't written down anything, after all, that any one could read.My children can't look over my shoulder on to this page, for they
would not understand it.It means nothing to any one in the world but
me.I shall have to translate for them or I shall have to say to them,
'Children, on looking into this book, I find I can't tell you what
love meant to me, because the words I have put down would mean nothing
to you.They were only meant to inform me, whenever I should turn back
to them, of the great glory and holiness that fell upon me like a
garment when love came.'"And if there should be any doubt in my heart as to the reality of the
feeling that has come to them in their turn, I should only have to
turn their faces up to the light, and look into their eyes and
_know_."I shall not die as my own mother did.I know that Peter
will be by my side until we both are old.These facts are established
in my consciousness I hardly know how, and I know that they are
there,--but if such a thing could be that I should die and leave my
little children, I would not be afraid to leave them alone in a world
that has been so good to me, under the protection of a Power that
provided me with the best and kindest guardians that a little orphan
ever had.God bless and keep them all, and make them happy."Powhatan replied with dignity that he gladly accepted the salute of love
and peace, which he and his subjects would exactly maintain.But as to
the other matter he said: "My daughter, whom my brother desireth, I sold
within these three days to be wife to a great Weroance for two bushels
of Roanoke [a small kind of beads made of oyster shells], and it is true
she is already gone with him, three days' journey from me."Hamor persisted that this marriage need not stand in the way; "that if
he pleased herein to gratify his Brother he might, restoring the Roanoke
without the imputation of injustice, take home his daughter again, the
rather because she was not full twelve years old, and therefore not
marriageable; assuring him besides the bond of peace, so much the
firmer, he should have treble the price of his daughter in beads,
copper, hatchets, and many other things more useful for him."The reply of the noble old savage to this infamous demand ought to have
brought a blush to the cheeks of those who made it.He said he loved his
daughter as dearly as his life; he had many children, but he delighted
in none so much as in her; he could not live if he did not see her
often, as he would not if she were living with the whites, and he
was determined not to put himself in their hands.He desired no other
assurance of friendship than his brother had given him, who had already
one of his daughters as a pledge, which was sufficient while she lived;
"when she dieth he shall have another child of mine."And then he broke
forth in pathetic eloquence: "I hold it not a brotherly part of your
King, to desire to bereave me of two of my children at once; further
give him to understand, that if he had no pledge at all, he should not
need to distrust any injury from me, or any under my subjection; there
have been too many of his and my men killed, and by my occasion there
shall never be more; I which have power to perform it have said it; no
not though I should have just occasion offered, for I am now old and
would gladly end my days in peace; so as if the English offer me any
injury, my country is large enough, I will remove myself farther from
you."The old man hospitably entertained his guests for a day or two, loaded
them with presents, among which were two dressed buckskins, white as
snow, for his son and daughter, and, requesting some articles sent him
in return, bade them farewell with this message to Governor Dale: "I
hope this will give him good satisfaction, if it do not I will go three
days' journey farther from him, and never see Englishmen more."It
speaks well for the temperate habits of this savage that after he had
feasted his guests, "he caused to be fetched a great glass of sack, some
three quarts or better, which Captain Newport had given him six or seven
years since, carefully preserved by him, not much above a pint in all
this time spent, and gave each of us in a great oyster shell some three
spoonfuls."We trust that Sir Thomas Dale gave a faithful account of all this to his
wife in England.Sir Thomas Gates left Virginia in the spring of 1614 and never returned.After his departure scarcity and severity developed a mutiny, and six
of the settlers were executed.Rolfe was planting tobacco (he has the
credit of being the first white planter of it), and his wife was getting
an inside view of Christian civilization.In 1616 Sir Thomas Dale returned to England with his company and John
Rolfe and Pocahontas, and several other Indians.They reached Plymouth
early in June, and on the 20th Lord Carew made this note: "Sir Thomas
Dale returned from Virginia; he hath brought divers men and women of
thatt countrye to be educated here, and one Rolfe who married a daughter
of Pohetan (the barbarous prince) called Pocahuntas, hath brought his
wife with him into England."On the 22d Sir John Chamberlain wrote to
Sir Dudley Carlton that there were "ten or twelve, old and young, of
that country."The Indian girls who came with Pocahontas appear to have been a great
care to the London company.In May, 1620, is a record that the company
had to pay for physic and cordials for one of them who had been living
as a servant in Cheapside, and was very weak of a consumption.The same
year two other of the maids were shipped off to the Bermudas, after
being long a charge to the company, in the hope that they might there
get husbands, "that after they were converted and had children, they
might be sent to their country and kindred to civilize them."The attempt to educate them in England was not
very successful, and a proposal to bring over Indian boys obtained this
comment from Sir Edwin Sandys:

"Now to send for them into England, and to have them educated here, he
found upon experience of those brought by Sir Thomas Dale, might be far
from the Christian work intended."One Nanamack, a lad brought over by
Lord Delaware, lived some years in houses where "he heard not much of
religion but sins, had many times examples of drinking, swearing and
like evils, ran as he was a mere Pagan," till he fell in with a
devout family and changed his life, but died before he was baptized.Accompanying Pocahontas was a councilor of Powhatan, one Tomocomo, the
husband of one of her sisters, of whom Purchas says in his "Pilgrimes":
"With this savage I have often conversed with my good friend Master
Doctor Goldstone where he was a frequent geust, and where I have seen
him sing and dance his diabolical measures, and heard him discourse of
his country and religion.... Master Rolfe lent me a discourse which
I have in my Pilgrimage delivered.And his wife did not only accustom
herself to civility, but still carried herself as the daughter of a
king, and was accordingly respected, not only by the Company which
allowed provision for herself and her son, but of divers particular
persons of honor, in their hopeful zeal by her to advance Christianity.I was present when my honorable and reverend patron, the Lord Bishop of
London, Doctor King, entertained her with festival state and pomp beyond
what I had seen in his great hospitality offered to other ladies.At
her return towards Virginia she came at Gravesend to her end and grave,
having given great demonstration of her Christian sincerity, as the
first fruits of Virginia conversion, leaving here a goodly memory,
and the hopes of her resurrection, her soul aspiring to see and enjoy
permanently in heaven what here she had joyed to hear and believe of her
blessed Saviour.Not such was Tomocomo, but a blasphemer of what he knew
not and preferring his God to ours because he taught them (by his own
so appearing) to wear their Devil-lock at the left ear; he acquainted me
with the manner of that his appearance, and believed that their Okee or
Devil had taught them their husbandry."Upon news of her arrival, Captain Smith, either to increase his own
importance or because Pocahontas was neglected, addressed a letter or
"little booke" to Queen Anne, the consort of King James.This letter is
found in Smith's "General Historie" ( 1624), where it is introduced
as having been sent to Queen Anne in 1616.We find no mention of its receipt or of any acknowledgment of
it.Whether the "abstract" in the "General Historie" is exactly like
the original we have no means of knowing.We have no more confidence in
Smith's memory than we have in his dates.The letter is as follows:

"To the most high and vertuous Princesse Queene Anne of Great Brittaine."The love I beare my God, my King and Countrie hath so oft emboldened me
in the worst of extreme dangers, that now honestie doth constraine mee
presume thus farre beyond my selfe, to present your Majestie this short
discourse: if ingratitude be a deadly poyson to all honest vertues,
I must be guiltie of that crime if I should omit any meanes to bee
thankful."That some ten yeeres agoe being in Virginia, and taken prisoner by the
power of Powhaten, their chiefe King, I received from this great Salvage
exceeding great courtesie, especially from his sonne Nantaquaus, the
most manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit, I ever saw in a Salvage and
his sister Pocahontas, the Kings most deare and well-beloved daughter,
being but a childe of twelve or thirteen yeeres of age, whose
compassionate pitifull heart, of desperate estate, gave me much cause
to respect her: I being the first Christian this proud King and his grim
attendants ever saw, and thus enthralled in their barbarous power, I
cannot say I felt the least occasion of want that was in the power of
those my mortall foes to prevent notwithstanding al their threats.After
some six weeks fatting amongst those Salvage Courtiers, at the minute of
my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her owne braines to save
mine, and not onely that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was
safely conducted to Jamestowne, where I found about eight and thirty
miserable poore and sicke creatures, to keepe possession of all those
large territories of Virginia, such was the weaknesse of this poore
Commonwealth, as had the Salvages not fed us, we directly had starved."And this reliefe, most gracious Queene, was commonly brought us by
this Lady Pocahontas, notwithstanding all these passages when inconstant
Fortune turned our Peace to warre, this tender Virgin would still not
spare to dare to visit us, and by her our jarres have been oft appeased,
and our wants still supplyed; were it the policie of her father thus to
imploy her, or the ordinance of God thus to make her his instrument, or
her extraordinarie affection to our Nation, I know not: but of this I am
sure: when her father with the utmost of his policie and power, sought
to surprize mee, having but eighteene with mee, the dark night could not
affright her from comming through the irksome woods, and with watered
eies gave me intilligence, with her best advice to escape his furie:
which had hee known hee had surely slaine her.Jamestowne with her wild
traine she as freely frequented, as her father's habitation: and during
the time of two or three yeares, she next under God, was still the
instrument to preserve this Colonie from death, famine and utter
confusion, which if in those times had once beene dissolved, Virginia
might have laine as it was at our first arrivall to this day.Since
then, this buisinesse having been turned and varied by many accidents
from that I left it at: it is most certaine, after a long and
troublesome warre after my departure, betwixt her father and our
Colonie, all which time shee was not heard of, about two yeeres longer,
the Colonie by that meanes was releived, peace concluded, and at last
rejecting her barbarous condition, was maried to an English Gentleman,
with whom at this present she is in England; the first Christian ever of
that Nation, the first Virginian ever spake English, or had a childe
in mariage by an Englishman, a matter surely, if my meaning bee truly
considered and well understood, worthy a Princes understanding."Thus most gracious Lady, I have related to your Majestic, what at your
best leasure our approved Histories will account you at large, and done
in the time of your Majesties life, and however this might bee presented
you from a more worthy pen, it cannot from a more honest heart, as yet
I never begged anything of the State, or any, and it is my want of
abilitie and her exceeding desert, your birth, meanes, and authoritie,
her birth, vertue, want and simplicitie, doth make mee thus bold, humbly
to beseech your Majestic: to take this knowledge of her though it be
from one so unworthy to be the reporter, as myselfe, her husband's
estate not being able to make her fit to attend your Majestic: the most
and least I can doe, is to tell you this, because none so oft hath tried
it as myselfe: and the rather being of so great a spirit, however her
station: if she should not be well received, seeing this Kingdome
may rightly have a Kingdome by her meanes: her present love to us and
Christianitie, might turne to such scorne and furie, as to divert all
this good to the worst of evill, when finding so great a Queene should
doe her some honour more than she can imagine, for being so kinde to
your servants and subjects, would so ravish her with content, as endeare
her dearest bloud to effect that, your Majestic and all the Kings honest
subjects most earnestly desire: and so I humbly kisse your gracious
hands."The passage in this letter, "She hazarded the beating out of her owne
braines to save mine," is inconsistent with the preceding portion of the
paragraph which speaks of "the exceeding great courtesie" of Powhatan;
and Smith was quite capable of inserting it afterwards when he made up
his

"General Historie."Smith represents himself at this time--the last half of 1616 and the
first three months of 1617--as preparing to attempt a third voyage to
New England (which he did not make), and too busy to do Pocahontas the
service she desired.She was staying at Branford, either from neglect
of the company or because the London smoke disagreed with her, and there
Smith went to see her.His account of his intercourse with her, the only
one we have, must be given for what it is worth.According to this she
had supposed Smith dead, and took umbrage at his neglect of her.He
writes:

"After a modest salutation, without any word, she turned about, obscured
her face, as not seeming well contented; and in that humour, her husband
with divers others, we all left her two or three hours repenting myself
to have writ she could speak English.But not long after she began to
talke, remembering me well what courtesies she had done: saying, 'You
did promise Powhatan what was yours should be his, and he the like to
you; you called him father, being in his land a stranger, and by the
same reason so must I do you:' which though I would have excused, I
durst not allow of that title, because she was a king's daughter.With
a well set countenance she said: 'Were you not afraid to come into my
father's country and cause fear in him and all his people (but me), and
fear you have I should call you father; I tell you then I will, and
you shall call me childe, and so I will be forever and ever, your
contrieman.They did tell me alwaies you were dead, and I knew no other
till I came to Plymouth, yet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakkin to seek
you, and know the truth, because your countriemen will lie much."'This savage was the Tomocomo spoken of above, who had been sent by
Powhatan to take a census of the people of England, and report what they
and their state were.At Plymouth he got a long stick and began to make
notches in it for the people he saw.But he was quickly weary of that
task.He told Smith that Powhatan bade him seek him out, and get him
to show him his God, and the King, Queen, and Prince, of whom Smith had
told so much.Smith put him off about showing his God, but said he had
heard that he had seen the King.This the Indian denied, James probably
not coming up to his idea of a king, till by circumstances he was
convinced he had seen him.Then he replied very sadly: "You gave
Powhatan a white dog, which Powhatan fed as himself, but your king gave
me nothing, and I am better than your white dog."Smith adds that he took several courtiers to see Pocahontas, and "they
did think God had a great hand in her conversion, and they have seen
many English ladies worse favoured, proportioned, and behavioured;" and
he heard that it had pleased the King and Queen greatly to esteem her,
as also Lord and Lady Delaware, and other persons of good quality, both
at the masques and otherwise.Much has been said about the reception of Pocahontas in London, but
the contemporary notices of her are scant.The Indians were objects of
curiosity for a time in London, as odd Americans have often been since,
and the rank of Pocahontas procured her special attention.At the playing of Ben Jonson's "Christmas his Mask" at court, January
6, 1616-17, Pocahontas and Tomocomo were both present, and Chamberlain
writes to Carleton: "The Virginian woman Pocahuntas with her father
counsellor have been with the King and graciously used, and both she and
her assistant were pleased at the Masque.She is upon her return though
sore against her will, if the wind would about to send her away."Neill says that "after the first weeks of her residence in England
she does not appear to be spoken of as the wife of Rolfe by the letter
writers," and the Rev.Peter Fontaine says that "when they heard that
Rolfe had married Pocahontas, it was deliberated in council whether he
had not committed high treason by so doing, that is marrying an Indian
princesse."His interest in the colony was never
the most intelligent, and apt to be in things trivial.15, 1609) writes to Lord Salisbury that he had told the King of
the Virginia squirrels brought into England, which are said to fly.The
King very earnestly asked if none were provided for him, and said he was
sure Salisbury would get him one.Would not have troubled him, "but that
you know so well how he is affected to these toys."There has been recently found in the British Museum a print of a
portrait of Pocahontas, with a legend round it in Latin, which is
translated: "Matoaka, alias Rebecka, Daughter of Prince Powhatan,
Emperor of Virginia; converted to Christianity, married Mr.Rolff; died
on shipboard at Gravesend 1617."This is doubtless the portrait engraved
by Simon De Passe in 1616, and now inserted in the extant copies of the
London edition of the "General Historie," 1624.It is not probable that
the portrait was originally published with the "General Historie."The
portrait inserted in the edition of 1624 has this inscription:

Round the portrait:

"Matoaka als Rebecca Filia Potentiss Princ: Pohatani Imp: Virginim."In the oval, under the portrait:

         "Aetatis suae 21 A.1616"
Below:

"Matoaks als Rebecka daughter to the mighty Prince Powhatan Emprour of
Attanoughkomouck als virginia converted and baptized in the Christian
faith, and wife to the worth Mr.Camden in his "History of Gravesend" says that everybody paid this
young lady all imaginable respect, and it was believed she would have
sufficiently acknowledged those favors, had she lived to return to her
own country, by bringing the Indians to a kinder disposition toward the
English; and that she died, "giving testimony all the time she lay sick,
of her being a very good Christian."The Lady Rebecka, as she was called in London, died on shipboard at
Gravesend after a brief illness, said to be of only three days, probably
on the 21st of March, 1617.I have seen somewhere a statement, which
I cannot confirm, that her disease was smallpox.George's Church,
where she was buried, was destroyed by fire in 1727.The register of
that church has this record:


       "1616, May 21 Rebecca Wrothe
        Wyff of Thomas Wroth gent
     A Virginia lady borne, here was buried
          in ye chaunncle."Yet there is no doubt, according to a record in the Calendar of State
Papers, dated "1617, 29 March, London," that her death occurred March
21, 1617.John Rolfe was made Secretary of Virginia when Captain Argall became
Governor, and seems to have been associated in the schemes of that
unscrupulous person and to have forfeited the good opinion of the
company.August 23, 1618, the company wrote to Argall: "We cannot
imagine why you should give us warning that Opechankano and the natives
have given the country to Mr.Rolfe's child, and that they reserve it
from all others till he comes of years except as we suppose as some
do here report it be a device of your own, to some special purpose for
yourself."It appears also by the minutes of the company in 1621 that
Lady Delaware had trouble to recover goods of hers left in Rolfe's hands
in Virginia, and desired a commission directed to Sir Thomas Wyatt and
Mr.George Sandys to examine what goods of the late "Lord Deleware had
come into Rolfe's possession and get satisfaction of him."This George
Sandys is the famous traveler who made a journey through the Turkish
Empire in 1610, and who wrote, while living in Virginia, the first book
written in the New World, the completion of his translation of Ovid's
"Metamorphosis."John Rolfe died in Virginia in 1622, leaving a wife and children.This is supposed to be his third wife, though there is no note of his
marriage to her nor of the death of his first.October 7, 1622, his
brother Henry Rolfe petitioned that the estate of John should be
converted to the support of his relict wife and children and to his own
indemnity for having brought up John's child by Powhatan's daughter.This child, named Thomas Rolfe, was given after the death of Pocahontas
to the keeping of Sir Lewis Stukely of Plymouth, who fell into evil
practices, and the boy was transferred to the guardianship of his uncle
Henry Rolfe, and educated in London.When he was grown up he returned
to Virginia, and was probably there married.There is on record his
application to the Virginia authorities in 1641 for leave to go into the
Indian country and visit Cleopatra, his mother's sister.He left an only
daughter who was married, says Stith (1753), "to Col.John Bolling; by
whom she left an only son, the late Major John Bolling, who was father
to the present Col.John Bolling, and several daughters, married to
Col.Campbell in his "History of Virginia"
says that the first Randolph that came to the James River was an
esteemed and industrious mechanic, and that one of his sons, Richard,
grandfather of the celebrated John Randolph, married Jane Bolling, the
great granddaughter of Pocahontas.In 1618 died the great Powhatan, full of years and satiated with
fighting and the savage delights of life.He had many names and titles;
his own people sometimes called him Ottaniack, sometimes Mamauatonick,
and usually in his presence Wahunsenasawk.He ruled, by inheritance and
conquest, with many chiefs under him, over a large territory with not
defined borders, lying on the James, the York, the Rappahannock, the
Potomac, and the Pawtuxet Rivers.He had several seats, at which he
alternately lived with his many wives and guard of bowmen, the chief of
which at the arrival of the English was Werowomocomo, on the Pamunkey
(York) River.He is said
to have had a hundred wives, and generally a dozen--the
youngest--personally attending him.When he had a mind to add to his
harem he seems to have had the ancient oriental custom of sending into
all his dominions for the fairest maidens to be brought from whom to
select.And he gave the wives of whom he was tired to his favorites.Strachey makes a striking description of him as he appeared about 1610:
"He is a goodly old man not yet shrincking, though well beaten with cold
and stormeye winters, in which he hath been patient of many necessityes
and attempts of his fortune to make his name and famely great.He is
supposed to be little lesse than eighty yeares old, I dare not saye how
much more; others saye he is of a tall stature and cleane lymbes, of a
sad aspect, rownd fatt visaged, with graie haires, but plaine and thin,
hanging upon his broad showlders; some few haires upon his chin, and so
on his upper lippe: he hath been a strong and able salvadge, synowye,
vigilant, ambitious, subtile to enlarge his dominions:... cruell he hath
been, and quarellous as well with his own wcrowanccs for trifles, and
that to strike a terrour and awe into them of his power and condicion,
as also with his neighbors in his younger days, though now delighted in
security and pleasure, and therefore stands upon reasonable conditions
of peace with all the great and absolute werowances about him, and is
likewise more quietly settled amongst his own."It was at this advanced age that he had the twelve favorite young wives
whom Strachey names.All his people obeyed him with fear and adoration,
presenting anything he ordered at his feet, and trembling if he frowned.His punishments were cruel; offenders were beaten to death before him,
or tied to trees and dismembered joint by joint, or broiled to death on
burning coals.Strachey wondered how such a barbarous prince should put
on such ostentation of majesty, yet he accounted for it as belonging to
the necessary divinity that doth hedge in a king: "Such is (I believe)
the impression of the divine nature, and however these (as other
heathens forsaken by the true light) have not that porcion of the
knowing blessed Christian spiritt, yet I am perswaded there is an
infused kind of divinities and extraordinary (appointed that it shall
be so by the King of kings) to such as are his ymedyate instruments on
earth."Here is perhaps as good a place as any to say a word or two about the
appearance and habits of Powhatan's subjects, as they were observed
by Strachey and Smith.A sort of religion they had, with priests or
conjurors, and houses set apart as temples, wherein images were kept
and conjurations performed, but the ceremonies seem not worship, but
propitiations against evil, and there seems to have been no conception
of an overruling power or of an immortal life.Smith describes a
ceremony of sacrifice of children to their deity; but this is doubtful,
although Parson Whittaker, who calls the Indians "naked slaves of the
devil," also says they sacrificed sometimes themselves and sometimes
their own children.An image of their god which he sent to England
"was painted upon one side of a toadstool, much like unto a deformed
monster."And he adds: "Their priests, whom they call Quockosoughs, are
no other but such as our English witches are."This notion I believe
also pertained among the New England colonists.There was a belief
that the Indian conjurors had some power over the elements, but not a
well-regulated power, and in time the Indians came to a belief in the
better effect of the invocations of the whites.In "Winslow's Relation,"
quoted by Alexander Young in his "Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,"
under date of July, 1623, we read that on account of a great drought
a fast day was appointed.The
exercise lasted eight or nine hours.Before they broke up, owing to
prayers the weather was overcast.This the Indians seeing, admired the goodness of our God: "showing the
difference between their conjuration and our invocation in the name
of God for rain; theirs being mixed with such storms and tempests, as
sometimes, instead of doing them good, it layeth the corn flat on the
ground; but ours in so gentle and seasonable a manner, as they never
observed the like."It was a common opinion of the early settlers in Virginia, as it was of
those in New England, that the Indians were born white, but that they
got a brown or tawny color by the use of red ointments, made of earth
and the juice of roots, with which they besmear themselves either
according to the custom of the country or as a defense against the
stinging of mosquitoes.The women are of the same hue as the men, says
Strachey; "howbeit, it is supposed neither of them naturally borne so
discolored; for Captain Smith (lyving sometymes amongst them) affirmeth
how they are from the womb indifferent white, but as the men, so doe the
women," "dye and disguise themselves into this tawny cowler, esteeming
it the best beauty to be nearest such a kind of murrey as a sodden
quince is of," as the Greek women colored their faces and the ancient
Britain women dyed themselves with red; "howbeit [Strachey slyly adds]
he or she that hath obtained the perfected art in the tempering of this
collour with any better kind of earth, yearb or root preserves it not
yet so secrett and precious unto herself as doe our great ladyes their
oyle of talchum, or other painting white and red, but they frindly
communicate the secret and teach it one another."Thomas Lechford in his "Plain Dealing; or Newes from New England,"
London, 1642, says: "They are of complexion swarthy and tawny; their
children are borne white, but they bedawbe them with oyle and colors
presently."The men are described as tall, straight, and of comely proportions; no
beards; hair black, coarse, and thick; noses broad, flat, and full at
the end; with big lips and wide mouths', yet nothing so unsightly as
the Moors; and the women as having "handsome limbs, slender arms, pretty
hands, and when they sing they have a pleasant tange in their voices.The men shaved their hair on the right side, the women acting as
barbers, and left the hair full length on the left side, with a lock an
ell long."A Puritan divine--"New England's Plantation, 1630"--says of
the Indians about him, "their hair is generally black, and cut before
like our gentlewomen, and one lock longer than the rest, much like to
our gentlemen, which fashion I think came from hence into England."Their love of ornaments is sufficiently illustrated by an extract from
Strachey, which is in substance what Smith writes:

"Their eares they boare with wyde holes, commonly two or three, and in
the same they doe hang chaines of stayned pearle braceletts, of white
bone or shreeds of copper, beaten thinne and bright, and wounde up
hollowe, and with a grate pride, certaine fowles' legges, eagles,
hawkes, turkeys, etc., with beasts clawes, bears, arrahacounes,
squirrells, etc.The clawes thrust through they let hang upon the cheeke
to the full view, and some of their men there be who will weare in these
holes a small greene and yellow-couloured live snake, neere half a yard
in length, which crawling and lapping himself about his neck oftentymes
familiarly, he suffreeth to kisse his lippes.Others weare a dead ratt
tyed by the tayle, and such like conundrums."This is the earliest use I find of our word "conundrum," and the sense
it bears here may aid in discovering its origin.Powhatan is a very large figure in early Virginia history, and deserves
his prominence.He was an able and crafty savage, and made a good fight
against the encroachments of the whites, but he was no match for
the crafty Smith, nor the double-dealing of the Christians.There is
something pathetic about the close of his life, his sorrow for the death
of his daughter in a strange land, when he saw his territories overrun
by the invaders, from whom he only asked peace, and the poor privilege
of moving further away from them into the wilderness if they denied him
peace.In the midst of this savagery Pocahontas blooms like a sweet, wild rose.She was, like the Douglas, "tender and true."Wanting apparently the
cruel nature of her race generally, her heroic qualities were all of the
heart.No one of all the contemporary writers has anything but gentle
words for her.Barbarous and untaught she was like her comrades, but of
a gentle nature.Stripped of all the fictions which Captain Smith has
woven into her story, and all the romantic suggestions which later
writers have indulged in, she appears, in the light of the few facts
that industry is able to gather concerning her, as a pleasing and
unrestrained Indian girl, probably not different from her savage sisters
in her habits, but bright and gentle; struck with admiration at the
appearance of the white men, and easily moved to pity them, and so
inclined to a growing and lasting friendship for them; tractable and apt
to learn refinements; accepting the new religion through love for those
who taught it, and finally becoming in her maturity a well-balanced,
sensible, dignified Christian woman.According to the long-accepted story of Pocahontas, she did something
more than interfere to save from barbarous torture and death a stranger
and a captive, who had forfeited his life by shooting those who
opposed his invasion.In all times, among the most savage tribes and in
civilized society, women have been moved to heavenly pity by the sight
of a prisoner, and risked life to save him--the impulse was as natural
to a Highland lass as to an African maid.Pocahontas went further than
efforts to make peace between the superior race and her own.When the
whites forced the Indians to contribute from their scanty stores to the
support of the invaders, and burned their dwellings and shot them on
sight if they refused, the Indian maid sympathized with the exposed
whites and warned them of stratagems against them; captured herself by a
base violation of the laws of hospitality, she was easily reconciled to
her situation, adopted the habits of the foreigners, married one of her
captors, and in peace and in war cast in her lot with the strangers.History has not preserved for us the Indian view of her conduct.It was no doubt fortunate for her, though perhaps not for the colony,
that her romantic career ended by an early death, so that she always
remains in history in the bloom of youth.She did not live to be pained
by the contrast, to which her eyes were opened, between her own and her
adopted people, nor to learn what things could be done in the Christian
name she loved, nor to see her husband in a less honorable light than
she left him, nor to be involved in any way in the frightful massacre
of 1622.If she had remained in England after the novelty was over, she
might have been subject to slights and mortifying neglect.The struggles
of the fighting colony could have brought her little but pain.Dying
when she did, she rounded out one of the prettiest romances of all
history, and secured for her name the affection of a great nation, whose
empire has spared little that belonged to her childhood and race, except
the remembrance of her friendship for those who destroyed her people.Oh dear me, how it
hurt!"Once," said Jimmieboy, wincing at the remembrance of his painful
experience."Well, pronouncing my name is to me worse than having all my teeth
pulled and then put back again, and except when I get hold of a fine
general like you I never make the sacrifice," said the Parallelopipedon."But tell me, Jimmieboy, you are out after preserved cherries and
pickled peaches, I understand?""And powdered sugar, almonds, jam, and several
other things that are large and elegant.""Well, just let me tell you one thing," said the Parallelopipedon,
confidentially."I'm so sick of cherries and peaches that I run every
time I see them, and when I run there is no tin soldier or general of
your size in the world that can catch me.I am
here to be captured; you are here to capture me.To accomplish our
various purposes we've got to begin right, and you might as well
understand now as at any other time that you are beginning wrong.""I don't know what else to do," said Jimmieboy.The
colonel told me to get those things, and I supposed I ought to get 'em.""It doesn't pay to suppose," said the Parallelopipedon."Many a victory
has been lost by a supposition.As that old idiot Major Blueface said
once, when he tried to tell an untruth, and so hit the truth by mistake:

    'Success always comes to
       The mortal who knows,
     And never to him who
       Does naught but suppose.For knowledge is certain,
       While hypothesees
     Oft drop defeat's curtain
       On great victories.'""They are ifs in words of four syllables," said the Parallelopipedon,
"and you want to steer clear of them as much as you can.""I'll try to," said Jimmieboy."But how am I to get knowledge instead of
hypotheseeses?"Well, that's only natural," said the Parallelopipedon, kindly."There
are only two creatures about here that do know everything.They--between
you and me--are me and myself.The others you meet here don't even begin
to know everything, though they'll try to make you believe they do.Now
I dare say that tin colonel of yours would try to make you believe that
water is wet, and that fire is hot, and other things like that.Well,
they are, but he doesn't know it.He has put his hand
into a pail of water and found out that it was wet, but he doesn't know
why it is wet any more than he knows why fire is hot.""Certainly," returned the Parallelopipedon."Water is wet because it is
water, and fire is hot because it wouldn't be fire if it wasn't hot.Oh,
it takes brains to know everything, Jimmieboy, and if there's one thing
old Colonel Zinc hasn't got, it's brains.If you don't believe it, cut
his head off some day and see for yourself.You won't find a whole brain
in his head.""It must be nice to know everything," said Jimmieboy."It's pretty nice," said the Parallelopipedon, cautiously."But it's not
always the nicest thing in the world.If you are off on a long journey,
for instance, it's awfully hard work to carry all you know along with
you.It has given me a headache many a time, I can tell you.Sometimes I
wish I did like your papa, and kept all I know in books instead of in my
head.It's a great deal better to do things that way; then, when you go
travelling, and have to take what you know along with you, you can just
pack it up in a trunk and make the railroad people carry it.""Do you know what's going to happen to-morrow and the next day?"asked
Jimmieboy, gazing in rapt admiration at the spot whence the voice
proceeded.That's just where the great trouble comes in," answered
the Parallelopipedon."It isn't so much bother to know what has
been--what everybody knows--but when you have to store up in your mind
thousands and millions of things that aren't so now, but have got to be
so some day, it's positively awful.Why, Jimmieboy," he said,
impressively, "you'd be terrified if I told you what is going to be
known by the time you go to school; it's awful to think of all the
things you will have to learn then that aren't things yet, but are going
to be within a year or two.I'm real sorry for the little boys who will
live a hundred years from now, when I think of all the history they will
have to learn when they go to school--history that isn't made yet.Just
take the Presidents of the United States, for instance.In George
Washington's time it didn't take a boy five seconds to learn the list of
Presidents; but think of that list to-day!Why, there are twenty-five
names on it now, and more to come.Now I--I
know the names of all the Presidents there's ever going to be, and it
would take me just eighteen million nine hundred and sixty-seven years,
eleven months and twenty-six days, four hours and twenty-eight minutes
to tell you all of them, and even then I wouldn't be half through.""Why, it's terrible," said Jimmieboy."Yes, indeed it is," returned the Parallelopipedon."You ought to be
glad you are a little boy now instead of having to wait until then.The
boys of the year 19,605,726,422 are going to have the hardest time in
the world learning things, and I don't believe they'll get through
going to school much before they're ninety years old.""I guess the colonel is glad he doesn't know all that," said Jimmieboy,
"if it's so hard to carry it around with you.""Indeed he ought to be, if he isn't," ejaculated the Parallelopipedon."There's no two ways about it; if he had the weight of one half of what
I know on his shoulders, it would bend him in two and squash him into a
piece of tin-foil.""Say," said Jimmieboy, after a moment's pause."I heard my papa say he
thought I might be President of the United States some day.If you know
all the names of the Presidents that are to come, tell me, will I be?""I don't remember any name like Jimmieboy on the list," said the
Parallelopipedon; "but that doesn't prove anything.You might get
elected on your last name.But don't let's talk about that--that's
politics, and I don't like politics.What I want to know is, do you
really want to capture me?""Yes, I do," said Jimmieboy."Then you'd better give up trying to get the peaches and cherries," said
the Parallelopipedon, firmly.You can shoot 'em at me
at the rate of a can a minute for ninety-seven years, and I'll never
surrender."But what am I to do, then?""What must I do
to capture you?""Get something in the place of the cherries and peaches that I like,
that's all."But I don't know what you like," said Jimmieboy."No--and you never will," answered the Parallelopipedon.I never eat lunch, breakfast, tea, or supper.I never eat
anything but dinner, and I eat that four times a day."Jimmieboy laughed, half with mirth at the oddity of the
Parallelopipedon's habit of eating, and half with the pleasure it gave
him to think of what a delectable habit it was.Four dinners a day
seemed to him to be the height of bliss, and he almost wished he too
were a Parallelopipedon, that he might enjoy the same privilege."Never," said the Parallelopipedon.There isn't time for it in
the first place, and in the second there's never anything left between
meals for me to eat.But if you had ever dined with me you'd know
mighty well what I like, for I always have the same thing at every
single dinner--two platefuls of each thing.It's a fine plan, that of
having the same dishes at every dinner, day after day.Your stomach
always knows what to expect, and is ready for it, so you don't get
cholera morbus.If you want me to, I'll tell you what I always have, and
what you must get me before you can coax me back."And then the Parallelopipedon recited the following delicious bill of
fare for the young general."THE PARALLELOPIPEDON'S DINNER.First bring on a spring mock-turtle
       Stuffed with chestnuts roasted through,
     Served in gravy; then a fertile
       Steaming bowl of oyster stew.Then about six dozen tartlets
       Full of huckleberry jam,
     Edges trimmed with juicy Bartletts--
       Pears, these latter--then some ham.Follow these with cauliflower,
       Soaked in maple syrup sweet;
     Then an apple large and sour,
       And a rich red rosy beet.Then eight quarts of cream--vanilla
       Is the flavor I like best--
     Acts sublimely as a chiller,
       Gives your fevered system rest.After this a pint of coffee,
       Forty jars of marmalade,
     And a pound of peanut toffee,
       Then a pumpkin pie--home-made.Top this off with pickled salmon,
       Cold roast beef, and eat it four
     Times each day, and ghastly famine
       Ne'er will enter at your door."cried Jimmieboy, dancing up and down, and clapping his
hands with delight at the very thought of such a meal."Do you mean to
say that you eat that four times a day?""Yes," said the Parallelopipedon, "I do.In fact, general, it is that
that has made me what I am.I was originally a Parallelogram, and I ate
that four times a day, and it kept doubling me up until I became six
Parallelograms as I am to-day.Get me those things--enough of them to
enable me to have 'em five times a day, and I surrender.Without them, I
go on and stay escaped forever, and the longer I stay escaped, the worse
it will be for these people who live about here, for I shall devastate
the country.I shall chew up all the mowing-machines in Pictureland.I'll bite the smoke-stack off every railway engine I encounter, and
throw it into the smoking car, where it really belongs.I'll drink all
the water in the wells.I'll pull up all the cellars by the roots; I may
even go so far as to run down into your nursery, and gnaw into the wire
that holds this picture country upon the wall, and let it drop into the
water pitcher.But, oh dear, there's the major coming down the road!"he
added, in a tone of alarm."I must go, or he'll insist on telling me a
poem.But remember what I say, my boy, and beware!I'll do all I
threaten to do if you don't do what I tell you.There was a slight rustling among the leaves, and the Parallelopipedon's
voice died away as Major Blueface came galloping up astride of his
panting, lather-covered steed.CHAPTER V.

THE MAJOR RETURNS."Well," said Jimmieboy, as the major dismounted, "did you catch up with
them?""No, I didn't," returned the major, evidently much excited."I should
have caught them but for a dreadful encounter I had up the road, for
between you and me, Jimmieboy, I have had a terrible adventure since I
saw you last, and the soldiers I went to order back have been destroyed
to the very last man.""I am glad I didn't go with you."I was attacked about four miles up the road by a tremendous sixty-pound
Quandary, and I was nearly killed," said the major."The soldiers had
only got four and a half miles on their way, and hearing the disturbance
and my cries for help they hastened to the rescue, and were simply
an-ni-hi-lated, which is old English for all mashed to pieces.""Oh, I had a way, and it worked, that's all.I'm the safest soldier in
the world, I am.You can capture me eight times a day, but I am always
sure to escape," said the major, proudly."But, my dear general, how is
it that you do not tremble?Are you not aware that under the
circumstances you ought to be a badly frightened warrior?""I don't tremble, because I don't know whether you are telling the truth
or not," said Jimmieboy."Besides, I never saw a Quandary, and so I
can't tell how terrible he is."He's more than dreadful," returned the major."No word of two syllables
expresses his dreadfulness.He is simply calamitous; and if there was a
longer word in the dictionary applying to his case I'd use it, if it
took all my front teeth out to say it.""That's all very well," said Jimmieboy, "but you can't make me shiver
with fear by saying he's calamitous.Well, I guess not," answered the major, scornfully.Would you bite an apple if you could swallow it whole?""I think I would," said Jimmieboy."How would I get the juice of it if I
didn't?""You'd get just as much juice whether you bit it or not," snapped the
major, who did not at all like Jimmieboy's coolness under the
circumstances."The Quandary doesn't bite anything, because his mouth is
so large there isn't anything he can bite.He just takes you as you
stand, gives a great gulp, and there you are."queried Jimmieboy, who could not quite follow the major."Wherever you happen to be, of course," said the major, gruffly."You
aren't a very sharp general, it seems to me.You don't seem to be able
to see through a hole with a millstone in it.I have to explain
everything to you just as if you were a baby or a school-teacher, but I
can just tell you that if you ever were attacked by a Quandary you
wouldn't like it much, and if he ever swallowed you you'd be a mighty
lonesome general for a little while."Don't get mad at me, major," said Jimmieboy, clapping his companion on
the back."I'll be frightened if you want me to.Br-rr-rrr-rrr-rrrrr!There, is that the kind of a tremble you want me to have?""Thank you, yes," the major replied, his face clearing and his smile
returning."I am very much obliged; and now to show you that you haven't
made any mistake in getting frightened, I'll tell you what a Quandary
is, and what he has done, and how I managed to escape; and as poetry is
the easiest method for me to express my thoughts with, I'll put it all
in rhyme.He is a fearful animal,
       That quaint old Quandary--
     A cousin of the tragical
     And whimsically magical
       Dilemma-bird is he.He has an eye that's wonderful--
       'Tis like a public school:
     It has a thousand dutiful,
     Though scarcely any beautiful,
       Small pupils 'neath its rule.And every pupil--marvelous
       Indeed, sir, to relate--
     When man becomes contiguous,
     Makes certainty ambiguous--
       Which is unfortunate.For when this ambiguity
       Has seized upon his prize,
     Whate'er man tries, to do it he
     Will find when he is through it, he
       Had best done otherwise.And hence it is this animal,
       Of which I sing my song,
     This creature reprehensible,
     Is held by persons sensible
       Responsible for wrong.So if a friend or foe you see
       Departing from his aim,
     Be full, I pray, of charity--
     He may have met the Quandary,
       And so is not to blame.""That is very pretty," said Jimmieboy, as the major finished; "but, do
you know, major, I don't understand one word of it."Much to Jimmieboy's surprise the major was pleased at this remark."Thank you, Jimmieboy," he said."That proves that I am a true poet.I
think there's some meaning in those lines, but it's so long since I
wrote them that I have forgotten exactly what I did mean, and it's that
very thing that makes a poem out of the verses.Poetry is nothing but
riddles in rhyme.You have to guess what is meant by the lines, and the
harder that is, the greater the poem.""But I don't see much use of it," said Jimmieboy."Riddles are fun
sometimes, but poetry isn't.""That's very true," said the major.If it
wasn't for poetry, the poets couldn't make a living, or if they did,
they'd have to go into some other business, and most other businesses
are crowded as it is.""Do people ever make a living writing poetry?"He called himself the
Grocer-Poet, because he was a grocer in the day-time and a poet at
night.He sold every poem he wrote, too," said the major.When he'd wake up
in the morning as a grocer he'd read what he had written the night
before as a poet, and then he'd buy the verses from himself and throw
them into the fire.He stares you right in the face whenever he meets you, and no
matter what you want to do he tries to force you to do the other thing.The only way to escape him is not to do anything, but go back where you
started from, and begin all over again."Why, where he's always met, of course, at a fork in the road.That's where he gets in his fine work," said the major."Suppose, for
instance, you were out for a stroll, and you thought you'd like to
go--well, say to Calcutta.You stroll along, and you stroll along, and
you stroll along.Then you come to a place where the road splits, one
half going to the right and one to the left, or, if you don't like right
and left, we'll say one going to Calcutta by way of Cape Horn, and the
other going to Calcutta by way of Greenland's icy mountains.""It's a long walk either way," said Jimmieboy.It's a walk that isn't often taken," assented the major, with a
knowing shake of the head."But at the fork of this road the Quandary
attacks you.He stops you and says, 'Which way are you going to
Calcutta?'and you say, 'Well, as it is a warm day, I think I'll go by
way of Greenland's icy mountains.''No,' says the Quandary, 'you won't
do any such thing, because it may snow.'Very well,' say you, 'I'll go the other way, then.''If it should grow very warm you'd be
roasted to death.''Then I don't know what to do,' say you.'What is the
matter with going both ways?'says the Quandary, to which you reply,
'How can I do that?'Then," continued the
major, his voice sinking to a whisper--"then you do try it and you do
see, unless you are a wise, sagacious, sapient, perspicacious, astute,
canny, penetrating, needle-witted, learned man of wisdom like myself who
knows a thing or two.In that case you don't try, for you can see
without trying that any man with two legs who tries to walk along two
roads leading in different directions at once is just going to split
into at least two halves before he has gone twenty miles, and that is
just what the Quandary wants you to do, for it's over such horrible
spectacles as a man divided against himself that he gloats, and when he
is through gloating he swallows what's left.""And what does the wise, sagacious, sappy, perspiring man of wisdom like
yourself who knows a thing or two do?""I didn't say sappy or perspiring," retorted the major."I said sapient
and perspicacious.""Well, anyhow, what does he do?""He gives up going to Calcutta," observed the major.To gain a victory over the Quandary you turn and run away?"I cried for help, turned about,
and ran back here, and I can tell you it takes a brave man to turn his
back on an enemy," said the major."And why didn't the soldiers do it too?""There wasn't anybody to order a retreat, so when the Quandary attacked
them they marched right on, single file, and every one of 'em split in
two, fell in a heap, and died.""But I should think you would have ordered them to halt," insisted
Jimmieboy."I had no power to do so," the major replied."If I had only had the
power, I might have saved their lives by ordering them to march two by
two instead of single file, and then when they met the Quandary they
could have gone right ahead, the left-hand men taking the left-hand
road, the right-hand men the right, but of course I only had orders to
tell them to come back here, and a soldier can only obey his orders.It
was awful the way those noble lives were sacrifi--"

Here Jimmieboy started to his feet with a cry of alarm.There were
unmistakable sounds of approaching footsteps."Somebody or something is coming," he cried."Oh, no, I guess not," said the major, getting red in the face, for he
recognized, as Jimmieboy did not, the firm, steady tread of the
returning soldiers whom he had told Jimmieboy the Quandary had
annihilated."It's only the drum of your ear you hear," he added."You
know you have a drum in your ear, and every once in a while it begins
its rub-a-dub-dub just like any other drum.Oh, no, you don't hear
anybody coming.Let's take a walk into the forest here and see if we
can't find a few pipe plants.I think I'd like to have a smoke."cried Jimmieboy, shaking his arm, which his
companion had taken, free from the major's grasp."You've been telling
me a great big fib, because there are the soldiers coming back again."ejaculated the major, in well-affected surprise.Why, do you know, general, that is the
most marvelous cure I ever saw in my life.To think that all those men
whom I saw not an hour ago lying dead on the field of battle, all ready
for the Quandary's luncheon, should have been resusitated in so short a
time, as--"

"Halt!"roared Jimmieboy, interrupting the major in a most
unceremonious fashion, for the soldiers by this time had reached a point
in the road directly opposite where he was sitting.cried Jimmieboy, after the corporal had told him the
proper order to give next.The soldiers broke ranks, and in sheer weariness threw themselves down
on the soft turf at the side of the road--all except the corporal, who
at Jimmieboy's request came and sat down at the general's side to make
his report."This is fine weather we are having, corporal," said the major, winking
at the subordinate officer, and trying to make him understand that the
less he said about the major the better it would be for all concerned."Better for sleeping than for military
duty, eh, major?"Here the major grew pale, but had the presence of mind to remark that he
thought it might rain in time for tea."There's something behind all this," thought Jimmieboy; "and I'm going
to know what it all means."Then he said aloud, "You have had a very speedy recovery, corporal."Here the major cleared his throat more loudly than usual, blushed rosy
red, and winked twice as violently at the corporal as before."Did you ever hear my poem on the 'Cold Tea River in China'?""No," said the corporal, "I never did, and I never want to.""Then I will recite it for you," said the major."After the corporal has made his report, major," said Jimmieboy."It goes this way," continued the major, pretending not to hear."Some years ago--'way back in '69--a
     Friend and I went for a trip through China,
     That pleasant land where rules King Tommy Chang,
     Where flows the silver river Yangtse-Wang--
       Through fertile fields, through sweetest-scented bowers
       Of creeping vinous vines and floral flowers.""My dear major," interrupted Jimmieboy, "I do not want to hurt your
feelings, but much as I like to hear your poetry I must listen to the
report of the corporal first.""Oh, very well," returned the major, observing that the corporal had
taken to his heels as soon as he had begun to recite.Jimmieboy then saw for the first time that the corporal had fled."I do not know," returned the major, coldly."I fancy he has gone to the
kitchen to cook his report."Oh, well, never mind," said Jimmieboy, noticing that the major was
evidently very much hurt."Go on with the poem about 'Cold Tea River.'""No, I shall not," replied the major."I shall not do it for two
reasons, general, unless you as my superior officer command me to do it,
and I hope you will not.In the first place, you have publicly
humiliated me in the presence of a tin corporal, an inferior in rank,
and consequently have hurt my feelings more deeply than you imagine.I
am not tall, sir, but my feelings are deep enough to be injured most
deeply, and in view of that fact I prefer to say nothing more about that
poem.The other reason is that there is really no such poem, because
there is really no such a stream as Cold Tea River in China, though
there might have been had Nature been as poetic and fanciful as I, for
it is as easy to conceive of a river having its source in the land of
the tea-trees, and having its waters so full of the essence of tea
gained from contact with the roots of those trees, that to all intents
and purposes it is a river of tea.Had you permitted me to go on
uninterrupted I should have made up a poem on that subject, and might
possibly by this time have had it done, but as it is, it never will be
composed.If you will permit me I will take a horseback ride and see if
I cannot forget the trials of this memorable day.If I return I shall be
back, but otherwise you may never see me again.I feel so badly over
your treatment of me that I may be rash enough to commit suicide by
jumping into a smelting-pot and being moulded over again into a piece of
shot, and if I do, general, if I do, and if I ever get into battle and
am fired out of a gun, I shall seek out that corporal, and use my best
efforts to amputate his head off so quickly that he won't know what has
happened till he tries to think, and finds he hasn't anything to do it
with."Breathing which horrible threat, the major mounted his horse and
galloped madly down the road, and Jimmieboy, not knowing whether to be
sorry or amused, started on a search for the corporal in order that he
might hear his report, and gain, if possible, some solution of the
major's strange conduct.THE CORPORAL'S FAIRY STORY.Jimmieboy had not long to search for the corporal.He found that worthy
in a very few minutes, lying fast asleep under a tree some twenty or
thirty rods down the road, snoring away as if his life depended upon it.It was quite evident that the poor fellow was worn out with his
exertions, and Jimmieboy respected his weariness, and restrained his
strong impulse to awaken him.His consideration for the tired soldier was not without its reward, for
as Jimmieboy listened the corporal's snores took semblance to words,
which, as he remembered them, the snores of his papa in the early
morning had never done.Indeed, Jimmieboy and his small brother Russ
were agreed on the one point that their father's snores were about the
most uninteresting, uncalled for, unmeaning sounds in the world, which,
no doubt, was why they made it a point to interrupt them on every
possible occasion.The novelty of the present situation was delightful
to the little general.To be able to stand there and comprehend what it
was the corporal was snoring so vociferously, was most pleasing, and he
was still further entertained to note that it was nothing less than a
rollicking song that was having its sweetness wasted upon the desert air
by the sleeping officer before him.This is the song that Jimmieboy heard:

    "I would not be a man of peace,
         Oh, no-ho-ho--not I;
     But give me battles without cease;
     Give me grim war with no release,
         Or let me die-hi-hi.I love the frightful things we eat
         In times of war-or-or;
     The biscuit tough, the granite meat,
     And hard green apples are a treat
         Which I adore-dor-dor.I love the sound of roaring guns
         Upon my e-e-ears,
     I love in routs the lengthy runs,
     I do not mind the stupid puns
         Of dull-ull grenadiers.I should not weep to lose a limb,
         An arm, or thumb-bum-bum.I laugh with glee to hear the zim
     Of shells that make my chance seem slim
         Of getting safe back hum.Just let me sniff gunpowder in
         My nasal fee-a-ture,
     And I will ever sing and grin.To me sweet music is the din
         Of war, you may be sure.""If my dear old papa could snore
songs like that, wouldn't I let him sleep mornings!""He does," snored the corporal."The only trouble is he doesn't snore as
clearly as I do.It takes long practice to become a fluent snorer like
myself--that is to say, a snorer who can be understood by any one
whatever his age, nation, or position in life.That song I have just
snored for you could be understood by a Zulu just as well as you
understood it, because a snore is exactly the same in Zuluese as it is
in your language or any other--in which respect it resembles a cup of
coffee or a canary-bird.""Are you still snoring, or is this English you are speaking?""Snoring; and that proves just what I said, for you understood me just
as plainly as though I had spoken in English," returned the corporal,
his eyes still tightly closed in sleep."Snore me another poem," said Jimmieboy."No, I won't do that; but if you wish me to I'll snore you a fairy
tale," answered the corporal."That will be lovely," said Jimmieboy."Very well," observed the corporal, turning over on his back and
throwing his head back into an uncomfortable position so that he could
snore more loudly.Once upon a time there was a small boy
named Tom whose parents were so poor and so honest that they could not
afford to give him money enough to go to the circus when it came to
town, which made him very wretched and unhappy, because all the other
little boys who lived thereabouts were more fortunately situated, and
had bought tickets for the very first performance.Tom cried all night
and went about the town moaning all day, for he did want to see the
elephant whose picture was on the fences that could hold itself up on
its hind tail; the man who could toss five-hundred-pound cannon balls in
the air and catch them on top of his head as they came down; the trick
horse that could jump over a fence forty feet high without disturbing
the two-year-old wonder Pattycake who sat in a rocking-chair on his
back.As Tom very well said, these were things one had to see to
believe, and now they were coming, and just because he could not get
fifty cents he could not see them.why can't I go out into the world, and by hard
work earn the fifty cents I so much need to take me through the doors of
the circus tent into the presence of these marvelous creatures?'"And he went out and called upon a great lawyer and asked him if he did
not want a partner in his business for a day, but the lawyer only
laughed and told him to go to the doctor and ask him.So Tom went to the
doctor, and the doctor said he did not want a partner, but he did want a
boy to take medicines for him and tell him what they tasted like, and he
promised Tom fifty cents if he would be that boy for a day, and Tom said
he would try."Then the doctor got out his medicine-chest and gave Tom twelve bottles
of medicine, and told him to taste each one of them, and Tom tasted two
of them, and decided that he would rather do without the circus than
taste the rest, so the doctor bade him farewell, and Tom went to look
for something else to do.As he walked disconsolately down the street
and saw by the clock that it was nearly eleven o'clock, he made up his
mind that he would think no more about the circus, but would go home and
study arithmetic instead, the chance of his being able to earn the
fifty cents seemed so very slight.So he turned back, and was about to
go to his home, when he caught sight of another circus poster, which
showed how the fiery, untamed giraffe caught cocoanuts in his mouth--the
cocoanuts being fired out of a cannon set off by a clown who looked as
if he could make a joke that would make an owl laugh.He couldn't miss that without at least making one further
effort to earn the money that would pay for his ticket."So off he started again in search of profitable employment.He had not
gone far when he came to a crockery shop, and on stopping to look in the
large shop window at the beautiful dishes and graceful soup tureens that
were to be seen there, he saw a sign on which was written in great
golden letters 'BOY WANTED.'Now Tom could not read, but something told
him that that sign was a good omen for him, so he went into the shop and
asked if they had any work that a boy of his size could do."'Yes,' said the owner of the shop."Tom answered bravely that he thought he was, and the man said he would
give him a trial anyhow, and sent him off on a sample errand, telling
him that if he did that one properly, he would pay him fifty cents a
day for as many days as he kept him, giving him a half holiday on all
circus-days.Tom was delighted, and started off gleefully to perform
the sample errand, which was to take a basketful of china plates to the
house of a rich merchant who lived four miles back in the country.Bravely the little fellow plodded along until he came to the gate-way
of the rich man's place, when so overcome was he with happiness at
getting something to do that he could not wait to get the gate open,
but leaped like a deer clear over the topmost pickets.his
very happiness was his ruin, for as he landed on the other side the
china plates flew out of the basket in every direction, and falling on
the hard gravel path were broken every one."cried Jimmieboy, sympathetically."Whereat the cow
        Remarked, 'Pray how--
     If what you say is true--
         How should the child,
         However mild,
     Become so wildly blue?'"asked Jimmieboy, very much surprised at
the rhyme, which, so far as he could see, had nothing to do with the
fairy story."There wasn't anything about a cow in the fairy story you were telling
about Tom," said Jimmieboy."Then you must have interrupted me," snored the corporal."You must
never interrupt a person who is snoring until he gets through, because
the chances are nine out of ten that, being asleep, he won't remember
what he has been snoring about, and will go off on something else
entirely."You had got to where Tom jumped over the gate and broke all the china
plates," answered Jimmieboy.I'll go on, but don't you say another thing until I
have finished," said the corporal.Then resuming his story, he snored
away as follows: "And falling on the hard gravel path the plates were
broken every one, which was awfully sad, as any one could understand
who could see how the poor little fellow threw himself down on the grass
and wept.He wept so long and such great tears,
that the grass about him for yards and yards looked as fresh and green
as though there had been a rain-storm.cried Tom, ruefully regarding the
shattered plates.'They'll beat me if I go back to the shop, and I'll
never get to see the circus after all.''They will not beat you, and I will see that you
get to the circus.'asked Tom, looking up and seeing before him a beautiful
lady, who looked as if she might be a part of the circus herself.'Are
you the lady with the iron jaw or the horseback lady that jumps through
hoops of fire?''I am your Fairy Godmother, and I have
come to tell you that if you will gather up the broken plates and take
them up to the great house yonder, I will fix it so that you can go to
the circus.'"'Won't they scold me for breaking the plates?'asked Tom, his eyes
brightening and his tears drying."'Take them and see,' said the Fairy Godmother, and Tom, who was always
an obedient lad, did as he was told.He gathered up the broken plates,
put them in his basket, and went up to the house."'Here are your plates,' he said, all of a tremble as he entered."'Let's see if any of them are broken,' said the merchant in a voice so
gruff that Tom trembled all the harder.Surely he was now in worse
trouble than ever.said the rich man taking one out and looking at it."'Yes,' said Tom, meekly, surprised to note that the plate was as good
as ever.roared the rich man, who didn't want mended plates.stammered Tom, who saw that he had made a bad mistake.'That is, I didn't mean to say mended.I meant to say that they'd been
very highly recommended.'The rest of them seem to be all right, too.Here, take your
basket and go along with you."And so Tom left the merchant's house very much pleased to have got out
of his scrape so easily, and feeling very grateful to his Fairy
Godmother for having helped him."'Well,' said she, when he got back to the gate where she was awaiting
him, 'was everything all right?''The plates were all right, and now they are
all left.'"The Fairy Godmother laughed and said he was a bright boy, and then she
asked him which he would rather do: pay fifty cents to go to the circus
once, or wear the coat of invisibility and walk in and out as many times
as he wanted to.To this Tom, who was a real boy, and preferred going to
the circus six times to going only once, replied that as he was afraid
he might lose the fifty cents he thought he would take the coat, though
he also thought, he said, if his dear Fairy Godmother could find it in
her heart to let him have both the coat and the fifty cents he could
find use for them."At this the Fairy Godmother laughed again, and said she guessed he
could, and, giving him two shining silver quarters and the coat of
invisibility, she made a mysterious remark, which he could not
understand, and disappeared.Tom kissed his hand toward the spot where
she had stood, now vacant, and ran gleefully homeward, happy as a bird,
for he had at last succeeded in obtaining the means for his visit to the
circus.That night, so excited was he, he hardly slept a wink, and even
when he did sleep, he dreamed of such unpleasant things as the bitter
medicines of the doctor and the broken plates, so that it was just as
well he should spend the greater part of the night awake."His excitement continued until the hour for going to the circus
arrived, when he put on his coat of invisibility and started.To test
the effect of the coat he approached one of his chums, who was standing
in the middle of the long line of boys waiting for the doors to open,
and tweaked his nose, deciding from the expression on his friend's
face--one of astonishment, alarm, and mystification--that he really was
invisible, and so, proceeding to the gates, he passed by the
ticket-taker into the tent without interference from any one.It was
simply lovely; all the seats in the place were unoccupied, and he could
have his choice of them."You may be sure he chose one well down in front, so that he should miss
no part of the performance, and then he waited for the beginning of the
very wonderful series of things that were to come.poor Tom was again doomed to a very mortifying disappointment.He
forgot that his invisibility made his lovely front seat appear to be
unoccupied, and while he was looking off in another direction a great,
heavy, fat man entered and sat down upon him, squeezing him so hard that
he could scarcely breathe, and as for howling, that was altogether out
of the question, and there through the whole performance the fat man
sat, and the invisible Tom saw not one of the marvelous acts or the
wonderful animals, and, what was worse, when a joke was got off he
couldn't see whether it was by the clown or the ring-master, and so
didn't know when to laugh even if he had wanted to.It was the most
dreadful disappointment Tom ever had, and he went home crying, and spent
the night groaning and moaning with sorrow."It was not until he began to dress for breakfast next morning, and his
two beautiful quarters rolled out of his pocket on the floor, that he
remembered he still had the means to go again.When he had made this
discovery he became happy once more, and started off with his invisible
coat hanging over his arm, and paid his way in for the second and last
performance like all the other boys.This time he saw all there was to
be seen, and was full of happiness, until the lions' cage was brought
in, when he thought it would be a fine thing to put on his invisible
coat, and enter the cage with the lion-tamer, which he did, having so
exciting a time looking at the lions and keeping out of their way that
he forgot to watch the tamer when he went out, so that finally when the
circus was all over Tom found himself locked in the cage with the lions
with nothing but raw meat to eat.This was bad enough, but what was
worse, the next city in which the circus was to exhibit was hundreds of
miles away from the town in which Tom lived, and no one was expected to
open the cage doors again for four weeks."When Tom heard this he was frightened to death almost, and rather than
spend all that time shut up in a small cage with the kings of the
beasts, he threw off the coat of invisibility and shrieked, and then--"

"Yes--then what?"cried Jimmieboy, breathlessly, so excited that he
could not help interrupting the corporal, despite the story-teller's
warning."The bull-dog said he thought it might,
       But pussy she said 'Nay,'
     At which the unicorn took fright,
       And stole a bale of hay,"

snored the corporal with a yawn.cried Jimmieboy, so excited to
hear what happened to little Tom in the lions' cage that he began to
shake the corporal almost fiercely.asked the corporal, sitting up and opening his
eyes."What are you trying to talk about, general?""Tom--and the circus--what happened to him in the lions' cage when he
took off his coat?"I don't know anything about any Tom or any
circus," replied the corporal, with a sleepy nod."But you've just been snoring to me about it," remonstrated Jimmieboy."Don't remember it at all," said the corporal."I must have been asleep
and dreamed it, or else you did, or maybe both of us did; but tell me,
general, in confidence now, and don't ever tell anybody I
asked you, have you such a thing as a--as a gum-drop in your pocket?"And Jimmieboy was so put out with the corporal for waking up just at
the wrong time that he wouldn't answer him, but turned on his heel, and
walked away very much concerned in his mind as to the possible fate of
poor little Tom.It cannot be said that Jimmieboy was entirely happy after his falling
out with the corporal.Of course it was very inconsiderate of the
corporal to wake up at the most exciting period of his fairy story, and
leave his commanding officer in a state of uncertainty as to the fate of
little Tom; but as he walked along the road, and thought the matter all
over, Jimmieboy reflected that after all he was himself as much to blame
as the corporal.In the first place, he had interrupted him in his story
at the point where it became most interesting, though warned in advance
not to do so, and in the second, he had not fallen back upon his
undoubted right as a general to command the corporal to go to sleep
again, and to stay so until his little romance was finished to the
satisfaction of his superior officer.The latter was without question
the thing he should have done, and at first he thought he would go back
and tell the corporal he was very sorry he hadn't done so.Indeed, he
would have gone back had he not met, as he rounded the turn, a
singular-looking little fellow, who, sitting high in an oak-tree at the
side of the road, attracted his attention by winking at him.Ordinarily
Jimmieboy would not have noticed anybody who winked at him, because his
papa had told him that people who would wink would smoke a pipe, which
was very wrong, particularly in people who were as small as this droll
person in the tree.But the singular-looking little fellow winked aloud,
and Jimmieboy could not help noticing him.Like most small boys
Jimmieboy delighted in noises, especially noises that went off like
pop-guns, which was just the kind of noise the tree dwarf made when he
winked.said Jimmieboy, as the sounds first attracted his
attention."Sitting on a limb and counting the stars in the sky," answered the
dwarf."There are, really," said the dwarf."There's more than that," said Jimmieboy."I've had stories told me of
twenty-seven or twenty-eight.""That doesn't prove anything," returned the dwarf, "that is, nothing but
what I said.If there are twenty-eight there must be seventeen, so you
can't catch me up on that.""I can't come now," returned the dwarf."I'm too busy counting the
eighteenth star, but I'll drop my telescope and let you see me through
that.""I'll help you count the stars if you come," put in Jimmieboy."How many
stars can you count a day?""Oh, about one and a half," said the dwarf."I could count more than
that, only I'm cross-eyed and see double, so that after I've got through
counting, I have to divide the whole number by two to get the proper
figures, and I never was good at dividing.I've always hated
division--particularly division of apples and peaches.There is no
meaner sum in any arithmetic in the world than that I used to have to
do every time I got an apple when I was your age.""It was to divide one apple by three boys," returned the queer little
man."Most generally that would be regarded as a case of three into one,
but in this instance it was one into three; and, worse than all, while
it pretended to be division, and was as hard as division, as far as I
was concerned it was subtraction too, and I was always the leftest part
of the remainder.""But I don't see why you had to divide your apples every time you got
any," said Jimmieboy."That's easy enough to explain," said the dwarf."If I didn't divide,
and did eat the whole apple, I'd have a fearful pain in my heart;
whereas if I gave my little brothers each a third, it would often happen
that they would get the pain and not I. After one or two experiments I
fixed it so that I never got the pain part any more--for you know every
apple has an ache in it--and they did, so, you see, I kept myself well
as could be, and at the same time built up quite a reputation for
generosity.""How did you fix it so as to give them the pain part always?""Why, I located the part of the apple that held the pain.I did not
divide one apple I got, but ate the whole thing myself, part by part.I
studied each part carefully, and discovered that apples are divided by
Nature into three parts, anyhow.Pleasure was one part, pain was another
part, and the third part was just nothing--neither pleasure nor pain.The core is where the ache is, the crisp is where the pleasure is, and
the skin represents the part which isn't anything.When I found that out
I said, 'Here!What is a good enough plan for Nature is a good enough
plan for me.I'll divide my apples on Nature's plan.'To
one brother I gave the core; to the other the skin; the rest I ate
myself.""It was very mean of you to make your brothers suffer the pain," said
Jimmieboy.One time one brother'd have the core;
another time the other brother'd have it.They took turns," said the
dwarf.cried Jimmieboy, who was so fond of his own
little brother that he would gladly have borne all his pains for him if
it could have been arranged."Well, meanness is my business," said the dwarf.echoed Jimmieboy, opening his eyes wide with
astonishment, meanness seemed such a strange business."You know what a fairy is, don't you?"It's a dear lovely creature with wings, that goes about doing
good."An unfairy is just the opposite," explained the dwarf.I am the fairy that makes things go wrong.When your hat blows off in the street the chances are that I have paid
the bellows man, who works up all these big winds we have, to do it.If
I see people having a good time on a picnic, I fly up to the sky and
push a rain cloud over where they are and drench them, having first of
course either hidden or punched great holes in their umbrellas.Oh, I
can tell you, I am the meanest creature that ever was.Why, do you know
what I did once in a country school?""No, I don't," said Jimmieboy, in tones of disgust."I don't know
anything about mean things.""Well, you ought to know about this," returned the dwarf, "because it
was just the meanest thing anybody ever did.There was a boy who'd
studied awfully hard in hopes that he would lead his class when the
holidays came, and there was another boy in the school who was equal to
him in everything but arithmetic, and who would have been beaten on that
one point, so that the other boy would have stood where he wanted to,
only I helped the second boy by rubbing out all the correct answers of
the first boy and putting others on the slate instead, so that the first
boy lost first place and had to take second."It was horrid," said Jimmieboy, "and it's a good thing you didn't come
down here when I asked you to, for if you had, I think I should now be
slapping you just as hard as I could.""Another time," said the unfairy, ignoring Jimmieboy's remark, "I turned
myself into a horse-fly and bothered a lame horse; then I changed into a
bull-dog and barked all night under the window of a man who wanted to go
to sleep, but my regular trick is going around to hat stores and taking
the brushes and brushing all the beaver hats the wrong way.Sometimes
when people get lost here in the woods and want to go to
Tiddledywinkland, I give them the wrong directions, so that they bring
up on the other side of the country, where they don't want to be; and
once last winter I put rust on the runners of a little boy's sled so
that he couldn't use it, and then when he'd spent three days getting
them polished up, I pushed a warm rain cloud over the hill where the
snow was and melted it all away.I hide toys I know children will be
sure to want; I tear the most exciting pages out of books; I spill salt
in the sugar-bowls and plant weeds in the gardens; I upset the ink on
love-letters; when I find a man with only one collar I fray it at the
edges; I roll collar buttons under bureaus; I--"

"Don't you dare tell me another thing!""I
don't like you, and I won't listen to you any more.""Oh, yes, you will," replied the unfairy."I am just mean enough to make
you, and I'll tell you why.I am very tired of my business, and I think
if I tell you all the horrid things I do, maybe you'll tell me how I can
keep from doing them.I have known you for a long time, only you didn't
know it.""I don't believe it," said Jimmieboy."Well, I have, just the same," returned the dwarf.Do you remember, one day you went out walking, how you walked two miles
and only met one mud-puddle, and fell into that?""Yes, I do," said Jimmieboy, sadly."I spoiled my new suit when I fell,
and I never knew how I came to do it.""I grabbed hold of
your foot, and upset you right into it.I waited two hours to do it,
too.""Well, I wish I had an axe.I'd chop that
tree down, and catch you and make you sorry for it.""I am sorry for it," said the dwarf.I've never ceased to
regret it.""Oh, well, I forgive you," said Jimmieboy, "if you are really sorry.""Yes, I am," said the dwarf; "I'm awfully sorry, because I didn't do it
right.You only ruined your suit and not that beautiful red necktie you
had on.Next time I'll be more careful and spoil everything.But let me
give you more proof that I've known you.Who do you suppose it was bent
your railway tracks at Christmas so they wouldn't work?""I did, and, what is more, it was I
who chewed up your best shoes and bit your plush dog's head off; it was
I who ate up your luncheon one day last March; it was I who pawed up all
the geraniums in your flower-bed; and it was I who nipped your friend
the postman in the leg on St.Valentine's day so that he lost your
valentine.""I've caught you there," said Jimmieboy."It wasn't you that did those
things at all.It was a horrid little brown dog that used to play around
our house did all that.""You think you are smart," laughed the dwarf."I don't see how you can have any friends if that is the way you
behave," said Jimmieboy, after a minute or two of silence."No," said the dwarf, his voice trembling a little--for as Jimmieboy
peered up into the tree at him he could see that he was crying just a
bit--"I haven't any, and I never had.I never had anybody to set me a
good example.My father and my mother were unfairies before me, and I
just grew to be one like them.I didn't want to be one, but I had to be;
and really it wasn't until I saw you pat a hand-organ monkey on the
head, instead of giving him a piece of cake with red pepper on it, as I
would have done, that I ever even dreamed that there were kind people in
the world.After I'd watched you for a while and had seen how happy you
were, and how many friends you had, I began to see how it was that I was
so miserable.I was miserable because I was mean, but nobody has ever
told me how not to be mean, and I'm just real upset over it.""I am really very, very
sorry for you.""So am I," sobbed the dwarf."Perhaps I can," said Jimmieboy."Well, wait a minute," said the dwarf, drying his eyes and peering
intently down the road.There is a sheep down the road
there tangled up in the brambles.Wait until I change myself into a big
black dog and scare her half to death.""But that will be mean," returned Jimmieboy; "and if you want to change,
and be good, and kind, why don't you begin now and help the sheep out?""Now that is an idea, isn't it!Do you know, I'd
never have thought of that if you hadn't suggested it to me.I'll change myself into a good-hearted shepherd's boy, and free
that poor animal at once!"The dwarf was as good as his word, and in a moment he came back, smiling
as happily as though he had made a great fortune."Why, it's lovely to do a thing like that."Do you
know, Jimmieboy, I've half a mind to turn mean again for just a minute,
and go back and frighten that sheep back into the bushes just for the
bliss of helping her out once more.""I wouldn't do that," said Jimmieboy, with a shake of his head."I'd
just change myself into a good fairy if I were you, and go about doing
kind things.When you see people having a picnic, push the rain cloud
away from them instead of over them.Do just the opposite from what
you've been doing all along, and pretty soon you'll have heaps and heaps
of friends.""You are a wonderful boy," said the dwarf."Why, you've hit without
thinking a minute the plan I've been searching for for years and years
and years, and I'll do just what you say.The dwarf pronounced one or two queer words the like of which Jimmieboy
had never heard before, and, presto change!quick as a wink the unfairy
had disappeared, and there stood at the small general's side the
handsomest, sweetest little sprite he had ever even dreamed or read
about.The sprite threw his arms about Jimmieboy's neck and kissed him
affectionately, wiped a tear of joy from his eye, and then said:

"I am so glad I met you.You have taught me how to be happy, and I am
sure I have lost eighteen hundred and seven tons in weight, I feel so
light and gay; and--joy!"Straight as--straight as--well, as straight
as your hair is curly."And that was as good an illustration as he could have found, for the
sprite's hair was just as curly as it could be."Where are you going, Jimmieboy?"asked the sprite, after they had
walked along in silence for a few minutes."I haven't the slightest idea," said Jimmieboy, with a short laugh."I
started out to provision the forces before pursuing the Parawelopipedon,
but I seem to have fallen out with everybody who could show me where to
go, and I am all at sea.""Well, you haven't fallen out with me," said the sprite."In fact,
you've fallen in with me, so that you are on dry land again.I'll show
you where to go, if you want me to.""Then you know where I can find the candied cherries and other things
that soldiers eat?""No, I don't know where you can find anything of the sort," returned the
sprite."But I do know that all things come to him who waits, so I'd
advise you to wait until the candied cherries and so forth come to you.""But what'll I do while I am waiting?"asked Jimmieboy, who had no wish
to be idle in this new and strange country."Follow me, of course," said the sprite, "and I'll show you the most
wonderful things you ever saw.I'll take you up to see old
Fortyforefoot, the biggest giant in all the world; after that we'll stop
in at Alltart's bakery and have lunch.It's a great bakery, Alltart's
is.You just wish for any kind of cake in the world, and you have it in
your mouth.""Let's go there first, I'm afraid of giants," said Jimmieboy."Well, I don't blame them for that," said the sprite."A little boy as
sweet as you are is almost too good not to eat; but I'll take care of
you.Fortyforefoot I haven't a doubt would like to eat both of us, but I
have a way of getting the best of fellows of that sort, so if you'll
come along you needn't have the slightest fear for your safety.""All right," said Jimmieboy, after thinking it all over.At this moment the galloping step of a horse was heard approaching, and
in a minute Major Blueface rode up."Why, how do you do, general?"he cried, his face beaming with pleasure
as he reined in his steed and dismounted."I haven't seen you
in--my!--why, not in years, sir."Quite well," said Jimmieboy, with a smile, for the major amused him
very much."It doesn't seem more than five minutes since I saw you
last," he added, with a sly wink at the sprite."Oh, it must be longer than that," said the major, gravely."It must be
at least ten, but they have seemed years to me--a seeming, sir, that is
well summed up in that lovely poem a friend of mine wrote some time ago:

    "'When I have quarreled with a dear
     Old friend, a minute seems a year;
     And you'll remember without doubt
     That when we parted we fell out.'"Reminds me of the
poems of Major Blueface."Yes," said the major, frowning at the sprite, whom he had never met
before."I have heard of Major Blueface, and not only have I heard of
him, but I am also one of his warmest friends and admirers."said the sprite, not noticing apparently that Jimmieboy was
nearly exploding with mirth.What sort of a person is the
major, sir?"returned the major, his chest swelling with pride."Brave as a
lobster, witty as a porcupine, and handsome as a full-blown rose.Many a time have I been with him on the field of
battle, where a man most truly shows what he is, and there it was, sir,
that I learned to love and admire Major Blueface.Why, once I saw that
man hit square in the back by the full charge of a brass cannon loaded
to the muzzle with dried pease.The force of the blow was
tremendous--forcible enough, sir, in fact, to knock the major off his
feet, but he never quailed.He rose with dignity, and walked back to
where the enemy was standing, and dared him to do it again, and when the
enemy did it again, the major did not forget, as some soldiers would
have done under the circumstances, that he was a gentleman, but he rose
up a second time and thanked the enemy for his courtesy, which so won
the enemy's heart that he surrendered at once.""Hero is no name for it, sir.On
another occasion which I recall," cried the major, with enthusiasm, "on
another occasion he was pursued by a lion around a circular path--he is
a magnificent runner, the major is--and he ran so much faster than the
lion that he soon caught up with his pursuer from the rear, and with one
blow of his sword severed the raging beast's tail from his body.Then he
sat down and waited until the lion got around to him again, his appetite
increased so by the exercise he had taken that he would have eaten
anything, and then what do you suppose that brave soldier did?"asked Jimmieboy, who had stopped laughing to listen."He gave the hungry creature his own tail to eat, and then went home,"
returned the major."Do you think I would tell an untrue story?""Not at all," said the sprite; "but if the major told it to you, it may
have grown just a little bit every time you told it."That could not be, for I am Major Blueface himself,"
interrupted the major."Then you are a brave man," said the sprite, "and I am proud to meet
you.""Thank you," said the major, his frown disappearing and his pleasant
smile returning."I have heard that remark before; but it is always
pleasant to hear.he added,
turning and addressing Jimmieboy."I am still searching for the provisions, major," returned Jimmieboy."The soldiers were so tired I hadn't the heart to command them to get
them for me, as you said, so I am as badly off as ever.""I think you need a rest," said the major, gravely; "and while it is
extremely important that the forces should be provided with all the
canned goods necessary to prolong their lives, the health of the
commanding officer is also a most precious consideration.As
commander-in-chief why don't you grant yourself a ten years' vacation on
full pay, and at the end of that time return to the laborious work you
have undertaken, refreshed?""If I go off, there
won't be any war.""That'll spite the enemy just
as much as it will our side; and maybe he'll get so tired waiting for
us to begin that he'll lie down and die or else give himself up.""Well, I don't know what to do," said Jimmieboy, very much perplexed."I'd hire some one else to take my place if I were you, and let him do
the fighting and provisioning until you are all ready," said the sprite."The Giant Fortyforefoot," returned the sprite.He's a great warrior in the first place and a great magician in the
second.He can do the most wonderful tricks you ever saw in all your
life.For instance,

    "He'll take two ordinary balls,
       He'll toss 'em to the sky,
     And each when to the earth it falls
       Will be a satin tie.He'll take a tricycle in hand,
       He'll give the thing a heave,
     He'll mutter some queer sentence, and
       'Twill go right up his sleeve.He'll ask you what your name may be,
       And if you answer 'Jim!'He'll turn a handspring--one, two, three!He'll take a fifty-dollar bill,
       He'll tie it to a chain,
     He'll cry out 'Presto!'and you will
       Not see your bill again.""I'd like to see him," said Jimmieboy."But I can't say I want to be
eaten up, you know, and I'd like to have you tell me before we go how
you are going to prevent his eating me.""You suffer under the great
disadvantage of being a very toothsome, tender morsel, and in all
probability Fortyforefoot would order you stewed in cream or made over
into a tart.added the major, smacking his lips so suggestively
that Jimmieboy drew away from him, slightly alarmed."Why, it makes my
mouth water to think of a pudding made of you, with a touch of cinnamon
and a dash of maple syrup, and a shake of sawdust and a hard sauce.This last word of the major's was a sort of ecstatic cluck such as boys
often make after having tasted something they are particularly fond of."What's the use of scaring the boy, Blueface?"said the sprite, angrily,
as he noted Jimmieboy's alarm.You can be
as brave and terrible as you please in the presence of your enemies, but
in the presence of my friends you've got to behave yourself."Why, he could rout me
with a frown.His little finger could, unaided, put me to flight if it
felt so disposed.I was complimenting him--not trying to frighten him."When I went into ecstasies
       O'er pudding made of him,
     'Twas just because I wished to please
       The honorable Jim;
     And now, in spite of your rebuff,
       The statement I repeat:
     I think he's really good enough
       For any one to eat.""Well, that's different," said the sprite, accepting the major's
statement."I quite agree with you there; but when you go clucking
around here like a hen who has just tasted the sweetest grain of corn
she ever had, or like a boy after eating a plate of ice-cream, you're
just a bit terrifying--particularly to the appetizing morsel that has
given rise to those clucks.It's enough to make the stoutest heart
quail."retorted the major, with a wink at Jimmieboy."Neither my
manner nor the manner of any other being could make a stout hart quail,
because stout harts are deer and quails are birds!"This more or less feeble joke served to put the three travelers in good
humor again.Jimmieboy smiled over it; the sprite snickered, and the
major threw himself down on the grass in a perfect paroxysm of laughter.When he had finished he got up again and said:

"Well, what are we going to do about it?I propose we attack
Fortyforefoot unawares and tie his hands behind his back."You are a wonderfully wise person," retorted the sprite."How on earth
is Fortyforefoot to show his tricks if we tie his hands?""By means of his tricks," returned the major."If he is any kind of a
magician he'll get his hands free in less than a minute.""I'm not good at
conundrums," said the major."I'm sure I don't know," returned the sprite, impatiently."Then why waste time asking riddles to which you don't know the answer?""You'll have me mad in a minute, and when I'm mad woe
be unto him which I'm angry at.""Don't quarrel," said Jimmieboy, stepping between his two friends, with
whom it seemed to be impossible to keep peace for any length of time."If you quarrel I shall leave you both and go back to my company."But he
mustn't do it again.Now as you have chosen to reject my plan of
attacking Fortyforefoot and tying his hands, suppose you suggest
something better, Mr."I think the safe thing would be for Jimmieboy to wear this invisible
coat of mine when in the giant's presence.If Fortyforefoot can't see
him he is safe," said the sprite."I don't see any invisible coat anywhere," said the major."Nobody can see it, of course," said the sprite, scornfully."Yes, I do," retorted the major."I only pretended I didn't so that I
could make you ask the question, which enables me to say that something
invisible is something you can't see, like your jokes.""I can make a better joke than you can with my hands tied behind my
back," snapped the sprite."I can't make jokes with your hands tied behind your back, but I can
make one with my own hands tied behind my back that Jimmieboy here can
see with his eyes shut," said the major, scornfully."Why--er--let me see; why--er--when is a sunbeam sharp?"asked the
major, who did not expect to be taken up so quickly."Bad as can be," said the sprite, his nose turned up until it interfered
with his eyesight.When is a joke not a
joke?""Haven't the slightest idea," observed Jimmieboy, after scratching his
head and trying to think for a minute or two."When it's one of the major's," roared the sprite, whereat the woods
rang with his laughter.The major first turned pale and then grew red in the face."That settles it," he said, throwing off his coat."That is a deadly
insult, and there is now no possible way to avoid a duel.""I am ready for you at any time," said the sprite, calmly."Only as the
challenged party I have the choice of weapons, and inasmuch as this is a
hot day, I choose the jawbone."said the major, with a gesture of
impatience.We will
withdraw to that moss-covered rock underneath the trees in there, gather
enough huckleberries and birch bark for our luncheon, and catch a mess
of trout from the brook to go with them, and then we can fight our duel
all the rest of the afternoon.""But how's that going to satisfy my wounded honor?""I'll tell one story," said the sprite, "and you'll tell another, and
when we are through, the one that Jimmieboy says has told the best story
will be the victor.That is better than trying to hurt each other, I
think.""I think so too," put in Jimmieboy."Well, it isn't a bad scheme," agreed the major."Particularly the
luncheon part of it; so you may count on me.I've got a story that will
lift your hair right off your head."So Jimmieboy and his two strange friends retired into the wood, gathered
the huckleberries and birch bark, caught, cooked, and ate the trout, and
then sat down together on the moss-covered rock to fight the duel.The
two fighters drew lots to find out which should tell the first story,
and as the sprite was the winner, he began."When I was not more than a thousand years old--" said the sprite."That was nine thousand years
ago--before this world was made.I celebrated my
ten-thousand-and-sixteenth birthday last Friday--but that has nothing to
do with my story.When I was not more than a thousand years of age, my
parents, who occupied a small star about forty million miles from here,
finding that my father could earn a better living if he were located
nearer the moon, moved away from my birthplace and rented a good-sized,
four-pronged star in the suburbs of the great orb of night.In the old
star we were too far away from the markets for my father to sell the
products of his farm for anything like what they cost him; freight
charges were very heavy, and often the stage-coach that ran between
Twinkleville and the moon would not stop at Twinkleville at all, and
then all the stuff that we had raised that week would get stale, lose
its fizz, and have to be thrown away.""Let me beg your pardon again," put in the major."But what did you
raise on your farm?I never heard of farm products having fizz to lose.""We raised soda-water chiefly," returned the sprite, amiably."Soda-water and suspender buttons.The soda-water was cultivated and the
suspender buttons seemed to grow wild.We never knew exactly how; though
from what I have learned since about them, I think I begin to understand
the science of it; and I wish now that I could find a way to return to
Twinkleville, because I am certain it must be a perfect treasure-house
of suspender buttons by this time.Even in my day they used to lie about
by the million--metallic buttons every one of them.They must be worth
to-day at least a dollar a thousand.""What is your idea about the way they happened to come there, based on
what you have learned since?""Well, it is a very simple idea," returned the sprite."You know when a
suspender button comes off it always disappears.Of course it must go
somewhere, but the question is, where?No one has ever yet been known to
recover the suspender button he has once really lost; and my notion of
it is simply that the minute a metal suspender button comes off the
clothes of anybody in all the whole universe, it immediately flies up
through the air and space to Twinkleville, which is nothing more than a
huge magnet, and lies there until somebody picks it up and tries to sell
it.I remember as a boy sweeping our back yard clear of them one
evening, and waking the next morning to find the whole place covered
with them again; but we never could make money on them, because the moon
was our sole market, and only the best people of the moon ever used
suspenders, and as these were unfortunately relatives of ours, we had to
give them all the buttons they wanted for nothing, so that the button
crops became rather an expense to us than otherwise.But with soda-water
it was different.Everybody, it doesn't make any difference where he
lives, likes soda-water, and it was an especially popular thing in the
moon, where the plain water is always so full of fish that nobody can
drink it.But as I said before, often the stage-coach wouldn't or
couldn't stop, and we found ourselves getting poorer every day.Finally
my father made up his mind to lease, and move into this new star, sink a
half-dozen soda-water wells there, and by means of a patent he owned,
which enabled him to give each well a separate and distinct flavor,
drive everybody else out of the business.""You don't happen to remember how that patent your father owned worked,
do you?"asked the major, noticing that Jimmieboy seemed particularly
interested when the sprite mentioned this."If you do, I'd like to buy
the plan of it from you and give it to Jimmieboy for a Christmas
present, so that he can have soda-water wells in his own back yard at
home.""No, I can't remember anything about it," said the sprite."Nine
thousand years is a long time to remember things of that kind, though I
don't think the scheme was a very hard one to work.For vanilla cream,
it only required a well with plain soda-water in it with a quart of
vanilla beans and three pints of cream poured into it four times a week;
same way with other flavors--a quart of strawberries for strawberry,
sarsaparilla for sarsaparilla, and so forth; but the secret was in the
pouring; there was something in the way papa did the pouring; I never
knew just what it was.But if you don't stop asking questions I'll never finish my story.""You shouldn't make it so interesting if you don't want us to have our
curiosity excited by it," said Jimmieboy."I'd have asked those
questions if the major hadn't."Well, we moved, and in a very short time were comfortably settled in
the suburban star I have mentioned," continued the sprite."As we
expected, my father grew very, very rich.He was referred to in the moon
newspapers as 'The Soda-water King,' and once an article about him said
that he owned the finest suspender-button mine in the universe, which
was more or less true, but which, as it turned out, was unfortunate in
its results.Some moon people hearing of his ownership of the
Twinkleville Button Mines came to him and tried to persuade him that
they ought to be worked.Father said he didn't see any use of it,
because the common people didn't wear suspenders, and so didn't need the
buttons."'True,' said they, 'but we can compel them to need them, by making a
law requiring that everybody over sixteen shall wear suspenders.'"'That's a good idea,' said my father, and he tried to have it made a
law that every one should wear suspenders, high or low, and as a result
he got everybody mad at him.The best people were angry, because up to
that time the wearing of suspenders had been regarded as a sign of noble
birth, and if everybody, including the common people, were to have them
they would cease to be so.The common people themselves were angry,
because to have to buy suspenders would simply be an addition to the
cost of living, and they hadn't any money to spare.In consequence we
were cut off by the best people of the moon.Nobody ever came to see us
except the very commonest kind of common people, and they came at night,
and then only to drop pailfuls of cod-liver oil, squills, ipecac, and
other unpopular things into our soda-water wells, so that in a very
short time my poor father's soda-water business was utterly ruined.People don't like to order ten quarts of vanilla cream soda-water for
Sunday dinner, and find it flavored with cod-liver oil, you know.""Yes, I do know," said Jimmieboy, screwing his face up in an endeavor to
give the major and the sprite some idea of how little he liked the taste
of cod-liver oil."I think cod-liver oil is worse than measles or
mumps, because you can't have measles or mumps more than once, and there
isn't any end to the times you can have cod-liver oil.""I'm with you there," said the major, emphasizing his remark by slapping
Jimmieboy on the back."In fact, sir, on page 29 of my book called
'Musings on Medicines' you will find--if it is ever published--these
lines:

          "The oils of cod!They make me feel tremendous odd,
           Nor hesitate
           I here to state
     I wildly hate the oils of cod.""When I start my autograph album I want you
to write those lines on the first page.""Never, I hope," replied the sprite, with a chuckle."And now suppose
you don't interrupt my story again."Clouds began to gather on the major's face again.The sprite's rebuke
had evidently made him very angry."Sir," said he, as soon as his feelings permitted him to speak."If you
make any more such remarks as that, another duel may be necessary after
this one is fought--which I should very much regret, for duels of this
sort consume a great deal of time, and unless I am much mistaken it will
shortly rain cats and dogs.""It looks that way," said the sprite, "and it is for that very reason
that I do not wish to be interrupted again.Of course ruin stared father
in the face."whispered the major to Jimmieboy, who immediately
silenced him."Trade having fallen away," continued the sprite, "we had to draw upon
our savings for our bread and butter, and finally, when the last penny
was spent, we made up our minds to leave the moon district entirely and
try life on the dog-star, where, we were informed, people only had one
eye apiece, and every man had so much to do that it took all of his one
eye's time looking after his own business so that there wasn't any left
for him to spend on other people's business.It seemed to my father that
in a place like this there was a splendid opening for him.""Renting out his extra eye to blind men," roared the sprite.Jimmieboy fell off the rock with laughter, and the major, angry at being
so neatly caught, rose up and walked away but immediately returned."If this wasn't a duel I wouldn't stay here another minute," he said."But you can't put me to flight that way."The question now came up as to how we should get to the dog-star,"
resumed the sprite."I should think they'd have been so glad you were leaving they'd have
paid your fare," said the major, but the sprite paid no attention."There was no regular stage line between the moon and the dog-star,"
said he, "and we had only two chances of really getting there, and they
were both so slim you could count their ribs.One was by getting aboard
the first comet that was going that way, and the other was by jumping.The trouble with the first chance was that as far as any one knew there
wasn't a comet expected to go in the direction of the dog-star for eight
million years--which was rather a long time for a starving family to
wait, and besides we had read of so many accidents in the moon papers
about people being injured while trying to board comets in motion that
we were a little timid about it.My father and I could have managed
very well; but mother might not have--ladies can't even get on horse
cars in motion without getting hurt, you know.It's a pretty big jump
from the moon to the dog-star, and if you don't aim yourself right you
are apt to miss it, and either fall into space or land somewhere else
where you don't want to go.For instance, a cousin of mine
who lived on Mars wanted to visit us when we lived at Twinkleville, but
he was too mean to pay his fare, thinking he could jump it cheaper.Well, he jumped and where do you suppose he landed?"He didn't come
anywhere near Twinkleville, although he supposed that he was aimed in
the right direction.""Will you tell me how you know he's falling yet?"asked the major, who
didn't seem to believe this part of the sprite's story.I saw him yesterday through a telescope," replied the
sprite."And he looked very tired, too," said the sprite."Though as a matter of
fact he doesn't have to exert himself any.All he has to do is fall,
and, once you get started, falling is the easiest thing in the world.But of course with the remembrance of my cousin's mistake in our minds,
we didn't care so much about making the jump, and we kept putting it off
and putting it off until finally some wretched people had a law made
abolishing us from the moon entirely, which meant that we had to leave
inside of twenty-four hours; so we packed up our trunks with the few
possessions we had left and threw them off toward the dog-star; then
mother and father took hold of hands and jumped and I was to come along
after them with some of the baggage that we hadn't got ready in time."According to my father's instructions I watched him carefully as he
sped through space to see whether he had started right, and to my great
joy I observed that he had--that very shortly both he and mother would
arrive safely on the dog-star--but alas!My joy was soon turned to
grief, for a terrible thing happened.Our great heavy family trunk that
had been dispatched first, and with truest aim, landed on the head of
the King of the dog-star, stove his crown in and nearly killed him.Hardly had the king risen up from the ground when he was again knocked
down by my poor father, who, utterly powerless to slow up or switch
himself to one side, landed precisely as the trunk had landed on the
monarch's head, doing quite as much more damage as the trunk had done in
the beginning.When added to these mishaps a shower of hat-boxes and
hand-bags, marked with our family name, fell upon the Lord Chief
Justice, the Prime Minister and the Heir Apparent, my parents were
arrested and thrown into prison and I decided that the dog-star was no
place for me.Wild with grief, and without looking to see where I was
going, nor in fact caring much, I gave a running leap out into space and
finally through some good fortune landed here on this earth which I have
found quite good enough for me ever since."Here the sprite paused and looked at Jimmieboy as much as to say, "How
is that for a tale of adventure?"cried the major, "Isn't it enough?"I don't see how he could have jumped
so many years before the world was made and yet land on the world.""I was five thousand years on the jump," explained the sprite."It was leap-year when you started, wasn't it?"asked the major, with a
sarcastic smile.asked Jimmieboy,
signaling the major to be quiet.I am afraid they got into serious
trouble.It's a very serious thing to knock a king down with a trunk and
land on his head yourself the minute he gets up again," sighed the
sprite."But didn't you tell me your parents were unfairies?"put in Jimmieboy,
eying the sprite distrustfully."Yes; but they were only my adopted parents," explained the sprite."They were a very rich old couple with lots of money and no children, so
I adopted them not knowing that they were unfairies.When they died they
left me all their bad habits, and their money went to found a storeroom
for worn out lawn-mowers."Well that's a pretty good story," said Jimmieboy."Yes," said the sprite, with a pleased smile."And the best part of it
is it's all true."CHAPTER X.

THE MAJOR'S TALE."A great many years ago when I was a souvenir spoon," said the major, "I
belonged to a very handsome and very powerful potentate.""I didn't quite understand what it was you said you were," said the
sprite, bending forward as if to hear better."At the beginning of my story I was a souvenir spoon," returned the
major."Did you begin your career as a spoon?""I did not, sir," replied the major."I began my career as a nugget in a
lead mine where I was found by the king of whom I have just spoken, and
on his return home with me he gave me to his wife who sent me out to a
lead smith's and had me made over into a souvenir spoon--and a mighty
handsome spoon I was too.I had a poem engraved on me that said:

    'Aka majo te roo li sah,
     Pe mink y rali mis tebah.'Rather pretty thought, don't you think so?"added the major as he
completed the couplet.said the sprite, with a knowing shake of his head."Well, I don't understand it at all," said Jimmieboy."Ask this native of Twinkleville what it means," observed the major with
a snicker."He says it's a pretty thought, so of course he understands
it--though I assure you I don't, for it doesn't mean anything.I made it
up, this very minute."It was quite evident that he had fallen into
the trap the major had set for him."I was only fooling," he said, with a sickly attempt at a smile."I think perhaps the happiest time of my life was during the hundreds of
years that I existed in the royal museum as a spoon," resumed the major."I was brought into use only on state occasions.When the King of
Mangapore gave a state banquet to other kings in the neighborhood I was
the spoon that was used to ladle out the royal broth."Here the major paused to smack his lips, and then a small tear appeared
in one corner of his eye and trickled slowly down the side of his nose."I always weep," he said, as soon as he could speak, "when I think of
that broth.Here is what it was made of:

    'Seven pies of sweetest mince,
     Then a ripe and mellow quince,
         Then a quart of tea.Then a pint of cinnamon,
     Next a roasted apple, done
         Brown as brown can be.Add of orange juice, a gill,
     And a sugared daffodil,
         Then a yellow yam.Sixty-seven strawberries
     Should be added then to these,
         And a pot of jam.Mix with maple syrup and
     Let it in the ice-box stand
         Till it's good and cold--
     Throw a box of raisins in,
     Stir it well--just make it spin--
         Till it looks like gold.'"What a dish it was, and I, I used to be
dipped into a tureen full of it sixteen times at every royal feast,
and before the war we had royal feasts on an average of three times
a day."cried Jimmieboy, his mouth watering to
think of it."Three a day until the unhappy war broke out
which destroyed all my happiness, and resulted in the downfall of
sixty-four kings.""How on earth did such a war as that ever happen to be fought?""I am sorry to say," replied the major, sadly, "that I was the innocent
cause of it all.It was on the king's birthday that war was declared.He
used to have magnificent birthday parties, quite like those that boys
like Jimmieboy here have, only instead of having a cake with a candle in
it for each year, King Fuzzywuz used to have one guest for each year,
and one whole cake for each guest.On his twenty-first birthday he had
twenty-one guests; on his thirtieth, thirty, and so on; and at every one
of these parties I used to be passed around to be admired, I was so very
handsome and valuable."said the sprite, with a sneering laugh."The idea of a lead
spoon being valuable!""If you had ever been able to get into the society of kings," the major
answered, with a great deal of dignity, "you would know that on the
table of a monarch lead is much more rare than silver and gold.It was
this fact that made me so overpoweringly valuable, and it is not
surprising that a great many of the kings who used to come to these
birthday parties should become envious of Fuzzywuz and wish they owned a
treasure like myself.One very old king died of envy because of me, and
his heir-apparent inherited his father's desire to possess me to such a
degree that he too pined away and finally disappeared entirely.Didn't die, you know, as you would, but
vanished."So it went on for years, and finally on his sixty-fourth birthday King
Fuzzywuz gave his usual party, and sixty-four of the choicest kings in
the world were invited.They every one came, the feast was made ready,
and just as the guests took their places around the table, the broth
with me lying at the side of the tureen was brought in.The kings all
took their crowns off in honor of my arrival, when suddenly pouf!a gust
of wind came along and blew out every light in the hall.All was
darkness, and in the midst of it I felt myself grabbed by the handle and
shoved hastily into an entirely strange pocket.'Turn off the wind and bring
a light.'"The slaves hastened to do as they were told, and in less time than it
takes to tell it, light and order were restored.I could see it very plainly through a button-hole in the
cloak of the potentate who had seized me and hidden me in his pocket.Fuzzywuz immediately discovered that I was missing.he roared to the head-waiter,
who, though he was an African of the blackest hue, turned white as a
sheet with fear."'It was in the broth, oh, Nepotic Fuzzywuz, King of the Desert and most
noble Potentate of the Sand Dunes, when I, thy miserable servant,
brought it into the gorgeous banqueting hall and set it here before
thee, who art ever my most Serene and Egotistic Master,' returned the
slave, trembling with fear and throwing himself flat upon the
dining-hall floor.Do
spoons take wings unto themselves and fly away?Are they tadpoles that
they develop legs and hop as frogs from our royal presence?Do spoons
evapidate----'

"'Evaporate, my dear,' suggested the queen in a whisper.'Do spoons evaporate like water in the
sun?Do they raise sails like sloops of war and thunder noiselessly out
of sight?Thou hast stolen it and thou must bear the penalty of
thy predilection----'

"'Dereliction,' whispered the queen, impatiently."'He knows what I mean,' roared the king, 'or if he doesn't he will when
his head is cut off.'""Is that what all those big words meant?""As I remember the occurrence, it is," returned the major."What the
king really meant was always uncertain; he always used such big words
and rarely got them right.Reprehensibility and tremulousness were great
favorites of his, though I don't believe he ever knew what they meant.But, to continue my story, at this point the king rose and sharpening
the carving knife was about to behead the slave's head off when the
potentate who had me in his pocket cried out:

"'Hold, oh Fuzzywuz!I saw the spoon myself at the
side of yon tureen when it was brought hither.'"'Then,' returned the king, 'it has been percolated----'

"'Peculated,' whispered the queen."'That's what I said,' retorted Fuzzywuz, angrily.'The spoon has been
speculated by some one of our royal brethren at this board.The point to
be liquidated now is, who has done this deed.A
guard about the palace gates--and lock the doors and bar the windows.I am sorry to say, that every king in this room
save only myself and my friend Prince Bigaroo, who at the risk of his
kingly dignity deigned to come to the rescue of my slave, must repeal--I
should say reveal--the contents of his pockets.Prince Bigaroo must be
innocent or he would not have ejaculated as he hath.'"You see," said the major, in explanation, "Bigaroo having stolen me was
smart enough to see how it would be if he spoke.A guilty person in nine
cases out of ten would have kept silent and let the slave suffer.So
Bigaroo escaped; but all the others were searched and of course I was
not found.Fuzzywuz was wild with sorrow and anger, and declared that
unless I was returned within ten minutes he would wage war upon, and
utterly destroy, every king in the place.The kings all turned
pale--even Bigaroo's cheek grew white, but having me he was determined
to keep me and so the war began.""Why didn't you speak and save the innocent kings?""Did you ever see a spoon with a
tongue?"He evidently had never seen a spoon with a
tongue."The war was a terrible one," said the major, resuming his story."One
by one the kings were destroyed, and finally only Bigaroo remained, and
Fuzzywuz not having found me in the treasures of the others, finally
came to see that it was Bigaroo who had stolen me.So he turned his
forces toward the wicked monarch, defeated his army, and set fire to his
palace.In that fire I was destroyed as a souvenir spoon and became a
lump of lead once more, lying in the ruins for nearly a thousand years,
when I was sold along with a lot of iron and other things to a junk
dealer.He in turn sold me to a ship-maker, who worked me over into a
sounding lead for a steamer he had built.On my first trip out I was
sent overboard to see how deep the ocean was.I fell in between two
huge rocks down on the ocean's bed and was caught, the rope connecting
me with the ship snapped, and there I was, twenty thousand fathoms under
the sea, lost, as I supposed, forever.The effect of the salt water upon
me was very much like that of hair restorer on some people's heads.I
began to grow a head of green hair--seaweed some people call it--and to
this fact, strangely enough, I owed my escape from the water.A sea-cow
who used to graze about where I lay, thinking that I was only a tuft of
grass gathered me in one afternoon and swallowed me without blinking,
and some time after, the cow having been caught and killed by some giant
fishermen, I was found by the wife of one of the men when the great cow
was about to be cooked.These giants were very strange people who
inhabited an island out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, which was
gradually sinking into the water with the weight of the people on it,
and which has now entirely disappeared.There wasn't one of the
inhabitants that was less than one hundred feet tall, and in those days
they used to act as light-houses for each other at night.They had but
one eye apiece, and when that was open it used to flash just like a
great electric light, and they'd take turns at standing up in the
middle of the island all night long and turning round and round and
round until you'd think they'd drop with dizziness.I staid with these
people, I should say, about forty years, when one morning two of the
giants got disputing as to which of them could throw a stone the
farthest.One of them said he could throw a pebble two thousand miles,
and the other said he could throw one all the way round the world.At
this the first one laughed and jeered, and to prove that he had told the
truth the second grabbed up what he thought was a pebble, but which
happened to be me and threw me from him with all his force."And sad to say I
killed the giant who threw me," returned the major."I went around the
world so swiftly that when I got back to the island the poor fellow
hadn't had time to get out of my way, and as I came whizzing along I
struck him in the back, went right through him, and leaving him dead on
the island went on again and finally fell into a great gun manufactory
in Massachusetts where I was smelted over into a bullet, and sent to the
war.I think I must have
killed off half a dozen regiments of his enemies, and between you and
me, General Washington said I was his favorite bullet, and added that as
long as he had me with him he wasn't afraid of anybody."Here the major paused a minute to smile at the sprite who was beginning
to look a little blue.It was rather plain, the sprite thought, that the
major was getting the best of the duel.How long did you stay with George
Washington?""I'd never have left him if he hadn't
ordered me to do work that I wasn't made for.When a bullet goes to war
he doesn't want to waste himself on ducks.I wanted to go after hostile
generals and majors and cornet players, and if Mr.Washington had used
me for them I'd have hit home every time, but instead of that he took me
off duck shooting one day and actually asked me to knock over a
miserable wild bird he happened to want.He
insisted, and I said,'very well, General, fire away.'He fired, the
duck laughed, and I simply flew off into the woods on the border of the
bay and rested there for nearly a hundred years.The rest of my story
is soon told.I lay where I had fallen until six years ago when I was
picked up by a small boy who used me for a sinker to go fishing with,
after which I found my way into the smelting pot once more, and on the
Fifteenth of November, 1892, I became what I am, Major Blueface, the
handsomest soldier, the bravest warrior, the most talented tin poet that
ever breathed."A long silence followed the completion of the major's story.Which of
the two he liked the better Jimmieboy could not make up his mind, and he
hoped his two companions would be considerate enough not to ask him to
decide between them."I thought they had to be true stories," said the sprite, gloomily."I
don't think it's fair to tell stories like yours--the idea of your being
thrown one and a half times around the world!""It's just as true as yours, anyhow," retorted the major, "but if you
want to begin all over again and tell another I'm ready for you.""We'll leave it to Jimmieboy as it is.""I don't know about that, major," said Jimmieboy."I think you are just
about even."asked the sprite, his face beaming with
pleasure."We'll settle it this way: we'll give five points
to the one who told the best, five points to the one who told the
longest, and five points to the one who told the shortest story.As the
stories are equally good you both get five points for that.The major's
was the longest, I think, so he gets five more, but so does the sprite
because his was the shortest.That makes you both ten, so you both win.""Yes," said the sprite, squeezing Jimmieboy's hand affectionately, "and
so do I."Which after all, I think, was the best way to decide a duel of that
sort."Well, now that that is settled," said the major with a sigh of relief,
"I suppose we had better start off and see whether Fortyforefoot will
attend to this business of getting the provisions for us.""The major is right there, Jimmieboy.You have
delayed so long on the way that it is about time you did something, and
the only way I know of for you to do it is by getting hold of
Fortyforefoot.If you wanted an apple pie and there was nothing in sight
but a cart-wheel he would change it into an apple pie for you.""That's all very well," replied Jimmieboy, "but I'm not going to call on
any giant who'd want to eat me.You might just as well understand that
right off.I'll try on your invisible coat and if that makes me
invisible I'll go.If it doesn't we'll have to try some other plan.""That is the prudent thing to do," said the major, nodding his approval
to the little general."As my poem tries to teach, it is always wise to
use your eyes--or look before you leap.The way it goes is this:

    'If you are asked to make a jump,
     Be careful lest you prove a gump--
         Awake or e'en in sleep--
     Don't hesitate the slightest bit
     To show that you've at least the wit
         To look before you leap.Why, in a dream one night, I thought
     A fellow told me that I ought
         To jump to Labrador.I did not look but blindly hopped,
     And where do you suppose I stopped?I do not say, had I been wise
     Enough that time to use my eyes--
         As I've already said--
     To Labrador I would have got:
     But this _is_ certain, I would not
         Have tumbled out of bed.'"The moral of which is, be careful how you go into things, and if you
are not certain that you are coming out all right don't go into them,"
added the major."Why, when I was a mouse----"

"Oh, come, major--you couldn't have been a mouse," interrupted the
sprite."You've just told us all about what you've been in the past, and
you couldn't have been all that and a mouse too.""So I have," said the major, with a smile."I'd forgotten that, and you
are right, too.I should have put what I
was going to say differently.If I had ever been a mouse--that's the way
it should be--if I had ever been a mouse and had been foolish enough to
stick my head into a mouse-trap after a piece of cheese without knowing
that I should get it out again, I should not have been here to-day, in
all likelihood.Try on the invisible
coat, Jimmieboy, and let's see how it works before you risk calling on
Fortyforefoot.""Here it is," said the sprite, holding out his hands with apparently
nothing in them.Jimmieboy laughed a little, it seemed so odd to have a person say "here
it is" and yet not be able to see the object referred to.He reached out
his hand, however, to take the coat, relying upon the sprite's statement
that it was there, and was very much surprised to find that his hand did
actually touch something that felt like a coat, and in fact was a coat,
though entirely invisible."Shall I help you on with it?""Perhaps you'd better," said Jimmieboy."It feels a little small for
me.""That's what I was afraid of," said the sprite."You see it covers me
all over from head to foot--that is the coat covers all but my head and
the hood covers that--but you are very much taller than I am."Here Jimmieboy, having at last got into the coat and buttoned it about
him, had the strange sensation of seeing all of himself disappear
excepting his head and legs.These remaining uncovered were of course
still in sight.laughed the major, merrily, as Jimmieboy walked around."That is the most ridiculous thing I ever saw.You're nothing but a head
and pair of legs."Jimmieboy smiled and placed the hood over his head and the major roared
louder than ever.That's funnier still--now
you're nothing but a pair of legs.Take it off quick or
I'll die with laughter.""I'm afraid it won't do, Spritey," he said."Fortyforefoot would see my
legs and if he caught them I'd be lost.""That's a fact," said the sprite, thoughtfully."The coat is almost two
feet too short for you.""It's more than two feet too short," laughed the major."It's two whole
legs too short.""This is no time for joking," said the sprite."We've too much to talk
about to use our mouths for laughing.""I won't get off any more, or if I do they
won't be the kind to make you laugh.But I say, boys," he added, "I have a scheme.It is of course the scheme
of a soldier and may be attended by danger, but if it is successful all
the more credit to the one who succeeds.We three people can attack
Fortyforefoot openly, capture him, and not let him go until he provides
us with the provisions.""That sounds lovely," sneered the sprite."But I'd like to know some of
the details of this scheme.It is easy enough to say attack him, capture
him and not let him go, but the question is, how shall we do all this?""It ought to be easy," returned the major."There are only three things
to be done.A kitten can attack an elephant if it wants to.The second is to capture
him, which, while it seems hard, is not really so if the attack is
properly made."Clear as a fog," put in the sprite."Now there are three of us--Jimmieboy, Spriteyboy and Yourstrulyboy,"
continued the major, "so what could be more natural than that we should
divide up these three operations among us?Therefore I propose
that Jimmieboy here shall attack Fortyforefoot; the sprite shall capture
him and throw him into a dungeon cell and I will crown the work by not
letting him go.""Jimmieboy and I take all the danger I
notice.""I am utterly unselfish about
it.I am willing to put myself in the background and let you have all
the danger and most of the glory.I only come in at the very end--but I
don't mind that.I have had glory enough for ten life-times, so why
should I grudge you this one little bit of it?My feelings in regard to
glory will be found on the fortieth page of Leaden Lyrics or the Ballads
of Ben Bullet--otherwise myself.The verses read as follows:

    'Though glory, it must be confessed,
       Is satisfying stuff,
     Upon my laurels let me rest
       For I have had enough.Ne'er was a glorier man than I,
       Ne'er shall a glorier be,
     Than, trembling reader, you'll espy--
       When haply you spy me.So bring no more--for while 'tis good
       To have, 'tis also plain
     A bit of added glory would
       Be apt to make me vain.'And I don't want to be vain," concluded the major."Well, I don't want any of your glory," said the sprite, "and if I know
Jimmieboy I don't think he does either.If you want to reverse your
order of things and do the dangerous part of the work yourself, we will
do all in our power to make your last hours comfortable, and I will see
to it that the newspapers tell how bravely you died, but we can't go
into the scheme any other way.""You talk as if you were the general's prime minister, or his nurse,"
retorted the major, "whereas in reality I, being his chief of staff, am
they if anybody are."Here the major blushed a little because he was not quite sure of his
grammar.Neither of his companions seemed to notice the mixture,
however, and so he continued:

"General, it is for you to say.Shall my plan go or shall she stay?""Well, I think myself, major, that it is a little too dangerous for me,
and if any other plan could be made I'd like it better," answered
Jimmieboy, anxious to soothe the major's feelings which were evidently
getting hurt again."Suppose I go back and order the soldiers to attack
Fortyforefoot and bring him in chains to me?""Couldn't be done," said the sprite."The minute the chains were clapped
on him he would change them into doughnuts and eat them all up.""Yes," put in the major, "and the chances are he would turn the soldiers
into a lot of toy balloons on a string and then cut the string.""He couldn't do that," said the sprite, "because he can't turn people or
animals into anything."Well, I think the best thing to do would be for me to change myself
into a giant bigger than he is," said the sprite."Then I could put you
and the major in my pockets and call upon Fortyforefoot and ask him, in
a polite way, to turn some pebbles and sticks and other articles into
the things we want, and, if he won't do it except he is paid, we'll pay
him if we can.""What do you propose to pay him with?""I suppose
you'll hand him half a dozen checkerberries and tell him if he'll turn
them into ten one dollar bills he'll have ten dollars."You can't tempt Fortyforefoot with
money.It is only by offering him something to eat that we can hope to
get his assistance."And you'll request him to turn a handful of pine cones into a dozen
turkeys on toast, I presume?"I shall simply offer to let him have
you for dinner--you will serve up well in croquettes--Blueface
croquettes--eh, Jimmieboy?"The poor major turned white with fear and rage.At first he felt
inclined to slay the sprite on the spot, and then it suddenly flashed
across his mind that before he could do it the sprite might really turn
himself into a giant and do with him as he had said.So he contented
himself with turning pale and giving a sickly smile."That would be a good joke on me," he said.Sprite, I don't think I would enjoy it, and after all I have a sort of
notion that I would disagree with Fortyforefoot--which would be
extremely unfortunate.I know I should rest like lead on his
digestion--and that would make him angry with you and I should be
sacrificed for nothing.""Well, I wouldn't consent to that anyhow," said Jimmieboy."I love the
major too much to----"

"So do we all," interrupted the sprite."Why even I love the major and I
wouldn't let anybody eat him for anything--no, sir!--not if I were
offered a whole vanilla eclaire would I permit the major to be eaten.I will turn myself into a giant
twice as big as Fortyforefoot; I will place you and the major in my
pockets and then I will call upon him.He will be so afraid of me that
he will do almost anything I ask him to, but to make him give us the
very best things he can make I would rather deal gently with him, and
instead of forcing him to make the peaches and cherries I'll offer to
trade you two fellows off for the things we need.He will be pleased
enough at the chance to get anything so good to eat as you look, and
he'll prepare everything for us, and he will put you down stairs in the
pantry.Then I will tell him stories, and some of the major's jokes, to
make him sleepy, and when finally he dozes off I will steal the pantry
key and set you free."It's a very good plan unless Fortyforefoot should find us so toothsome
looking that he would want to eat us raw.We may be nothing more than
fruit for him, you know, and truly I don't want to be anybody's apple,"
said Jimmieboy."You are quite correct there, general," said the major, with a chuckle."In fact, I'm quite sure he'd think you and I were fruit because being
two we are necessarily a pear.""It won't happen," said the sprite."He isn't likely to think you are
fruit and even if he does I won't let him eat you.I'll keep him from
doing it if I have to eat you myself.""Oh, of course, then, with a kind promise like that there is nothing
left for us to do but accept your proposition," said the
major."As Ben Bullet says:

    'When only one thing can be done--
       If people only knew it--
     The wisest course beneath the sun
       Is just to go and do it.'""I'm willing to take my chances," said Jimmieboy, "if after I see what
kind of a giant you can turn yourself into I think you are terrible
enough to frighten another giant.""Well, just watch me," said the sprite, taking off his coat."And mind,
however terrifying I may become, don't you get frightened, because I
won't hurt you.""Go ahead," said the major, valiantly."Wait until we get scared before
talking like that to us."'Bazam, bazam,
     A sprite I am,
     Bazoo, bazee,
     A giant I'd be.'"Then there came a terrific noise; the trees about the little group shook
to the very last end of their roots, all grew dark as night, and as
quickly grew light again.In the returning light Jimmieboy saw looming
up before him a fearful creature, eighty feet high, clad in a
magnificent suit embroidered with gold and silver, a fierce mustache
upon his lip, and dangling at his side was a heavy sword.It was the sprite now transformed into a giant--a terrible-looking
fellow, though to Jimmieboy he was not terrible because the boy knew
that the dreadful creature was only his little friend in disguise.came a bellowing voice from above the trees.I'm sure you'll do, and I am ready,"
said Jimmieboy, with a laugh.But there came no answer, and Jimmieboy, looking about him to see why
the major made no reply, was just in time to see that worthy soldier's
coat-tails disappearing down the road.The major was running away as fast as he could go."You've frightened him pretty well, Spritey," said Jimmieboy, with a
laugh, as the major passed out of sight."But you don't seem a bit afraid.""I'm not--though I think I should be if I didn't know who you are,"
returned Jimmieboy."Well, I need to be if I am to get the best of Fortyforefoot, but, I
say, you mustn't call me Spritey now that I am a giant.It won't do to
call me by any name that would show Fortyforefoot who I really am," said
the sprite, with a warning shake of his head."Bludgeonhead is my name now," replied the sprite."Benjamin B.
Bludgeonhead is my full name, but you know me well enough to call me
plain Bludgeonhead.""All right, plain Bludgeonhead," said Jimmieboy, "I'll do as you
say--and now don't you think we'd better be starting along?""Yes," said Bludgeonhead, reaching down and grabbing hold of Jimmieboy
with his huge hand."We'll start right away, and until we come in sight
of Fortyforefoot's house I think perhaps you'll be more comfortable if
you ride on my shoulder instead of in my coat-pocket.""Thank you very much," said Jimmieboy, as Bludgeonhead lifted him up
from the ground and set him lightly as a feather on his shoulder."I think I'd like to be
as tall as this all the time, Bludgeonhead.What a great thing it would
be on parade days to be as tall as this.Why I can see miles and miles
of country from here.""Yes, it's pretty fine--but I don't think I'd care to be so tall
always," returned Bludgeonhead, as he stepped over a great broad river
that lay in his path."It makes one very uppish to be as high in the air
as this; and you'd be all the time looking down on your friends, too,
which would be so unpleasant for your friends that they wouldn't have
anything to do with you after a while.I'm going to
jump over this mountain in front of us."Here Bludgeonhead drew back a little and then took a short run, after
which he leaped high in the air, and he and Jimmieboy sailed easily over
the great hills before them, and then alighted safe and sound on the
other side.cried Jimmieboy, clapping his hands with glee."I hope there are lots more hills like that to be jumped over.""No, there aren't," said Bludgeonhead, "but if you like it so much I'll
go back and do it again."Bludgeonhead turned back and jumped over the mountain half a dozen times
until Jimmieboy was satisfied and then he resumed his journey."This," he said, after trudging along in silence for some time, "this is
Fortyforefoot Valley, and in a short time we shall come to the giant's
castle; but meanwhile I want you to see what a wonderful place this is.The valley itself will give you a better idea of Fortyforefoot's great
power as a magician than anything else that I know of.Do you know what
this place was before he came here?""It was a great big hole in the ground," returned Bludgeonhead.Fortyforefoot liked the situation because it was
surrounded by mountains and nobody ever wanted to come here because sand
pits aren't worth visiting.There wasn't a tree or a speck of a green
thing anywhere in sight--nothing but yellow sand glaring in the sun all
day and sulking in the moon all night."It's all covered with beautiful trees and
gardens and brooks now," said Jimmieboy, which was quite true, for the
Fortyforefoot Valley was a perfect paradise to look at, filled with
everything that was beautiful in the way of birds and trees and flowers
and water courses."How could he make the trees and flowers grow in dry
hot sand like that?""By his magic power, of course," answered Bludgeonhead."He filled up a
good part of the sand pit with stones that he found about here, and then
he changed one part of the desert into a pond so that he could get all
the water he wanted.Then he took a square mile of sand and changed
every grain of it into blades of grass.Other portions he transformed
into forests until finally simply by the wonderful power he has to
change one thing into another he got the place into its present shape.""But the birds, how did he make them?""He didn't," said Bludgeonhead.They saw
what a beautiful place this was and they simply moved in."Bludgeonhead paused a moment in his walk and set Jimmieboy down on the
ground again."I think I'll take a rest here before going on.We are very near to
Fortyforefoot's castle now," he said."I'll sit down here for a few
moments and sharpen my sword and get in good shape for a fight if one
becomes necessary.This place is full of
traps for just such fellows as you who come in here.That's the way
Fortyforefoot catches them for dinner."So Jimmieboy staid close by Bludgeonhead's side and was very much
entertained by all that went on around him.He saw the most wonderful
birds imaginable, and great bumble-bees buzzed about in the flowers
gathering honey by the quart.Once a great jack-rabbit, three times as
large as he was, came rushing out of the woods toward him, and Jimmieboy
on stooping to pick up a stone to throw at Mr.Bunny to frighten him
away, found that all the stones in that enchanted valley were precious.He couldn't help laughing outright when he discovered that the stone he
had thrown at the rabbit was a huge diamond as big as his fist, and that
even had he stopped to choose a less expensive missile he would have had
to confine his choice to pearls, rubies, emeralds, and other gems of the
rarest sort.And then he noticed that what he thought was a rock upon
which he and Bludgeonhead were sitting was a massive nugget of pure
yellow gold.This lead him on to inspect the trees about him and then he
discovered a most absurd thing.Fortyforefoot's extravagance had
prompted him to make all his pine trees of the most beautifully polished
and richly inlaid mahogany; every one of the weeping willows was made of
solid oak, ornamented and carved until the eye wearied of its beauty,
and as for the birds in the trees, their nests were made not of stray
wisps of straw and hay stolen from the barns and fields, but of the
softest silk, rich in color and lined throughout with eiderdown, the
mere sight of which could hardly help being restful to a tired bird--or
boy either, for that matter, Jimmieboy thought."Did he make all this out of sand?All these jewels and magnificent
carvings?""Simply took up a handful of sand and tossed
it up in the air and whatever he commanded it to be it became.But the
most wonderful thing in this place is his spring.He made what you might
call a 'Wish Dipper' out of an old tin cup.Then he dug a hole and
filled it with sand which he commanded to become liquid, and, when the
sand heard him say that, it turned to liquid, but the singular thing
about it is that as Fortyforefoot didn't say what kind of liquid it
should be, it became any kind.So now if any one is thirsty and wants a
glass of cider all he has to do is to dip the wish dipper into the
spring and up comes cider.If he wants lemonade up comes lemonade.If he
wants milk up comes milk.As Bludgeonhead spoke these words Jimmieboy was startled to hear
something very much like an approaching footstep far down the road.he asked, seizing Bludgeonhead by the hand."Yes, I did," replied Bludgeonhead, in a whisper."It sounded to me like
Fortyforefoot's step, too.""I'd better hide, hadn't I?"Climb inside
my coat and snuggle down out of sight in my pocket.We musn't let him
see you yet awhile."Jimmieboy did as he was commanded, and found the pocket a very
comfortable place, only it was a little stuffy."It's pretty hot in here," he whispered."Well, look up on the left hand corner of the outer side of the pocket
and you'll find two flaps that are buttoned up," replied Bludgeonhead,
softly.One will let in all the air you want, and the
other will enable you to peep out and see Fortyforefoot without his
seeing you."In a minute the buttons were found and the flaps opened.Everything
happened as Bludgeonhead said it would, and in a minute Jimmieboy,
peering out through the hole in the cloak, saw Fortyforefoot
approaching.The owner of the beautiful valley seemed very angry when he caught sight
of Bludgeonhead sitting on his property, and hastening up to him, he
cried:

"What business have you here in the Valley of Fortyforefoot?"Jimmieboy shrank back into one corner of the pocket, a little overcome
with fear.Fortyforefoot was larger and more terrible than he thought."I am not good at riddles," said Bludgeonhead, calmly."That is at
riddles of that sort.If you had asked me the difference between a duck
and a garden rake I should have told you that a duck has no teeth and
can eat, while a rake has plenty of teeth and can't eat.But when you
ask me what business I have here I am forced to say that I can't say.""You are a very bright sort of a giant," sneered Fortyforefoot."The fact is I can't help being bright.My
mother polishes me every morning with a damp chamois.""Do you know to whom you are speaking?"asked Fortyforefoot,
threateningly."No; not having been introduced to you, I can't say I know you,"
returned Bludgeonhead.You are Anklehigh, the
Dwarf."At this Fortyforefoot turned purple with rage."I'll right quickly teach thee a
lesson thou rash fellow."Fortyforefoot strode up close to Bludgeonhead, whose size he could not
have guessed because Bludgeonhead had been sitting down all this time
and was pretty well covered over by his cloak.[Illustration: BLUDGEONHEAD SHOWS JIMMIEBOY TO FORTYFOREFOOT.[Blank Page]

"I'll take thee by thine ear and toss thee to the moon," he cried,
reaching out his hand to make good his word."Nonsense, Anklehigh," returned Bludgeonhead, calmly.No dwarf can fight with a giant of my size.""But I am not the dwarf Anklehigh," shrieked Fortyforefoot."And I am Bludgeonhead," returned the other, rising and towering way
above the owner of the valley.cried Fortyforefoot, falling on his knees in abject
terror.Pardon, O, Bludgeonhead.I did not know
you when I was so hasty as to offer to throw you to the moon.I thought
you were--er--that you were--er----"

"More easily thrown," suggested Bludgeonhead."Yes--yes--that was it," stammered Fortyforefoot."And now, to show that
you have forgiven me, I want you to come to my castle and have dinner
with me.""I'll be very glad to," replied Bludgeonhead."What are you going to
have for dinner?""Anything you wish," said Fortyforefoot."I was going to have a very
plain dinner to-night because for to-morrow's dinner I have invited my
brother Fortythreefoot and his wife Fortytwoinch to have a little
special dish I have been so fortunate as to secure.""Oh, only a sniveling creature I caught in one of my traps this
afternoon.He was a soldier, and he wasn't very brave about being
caught, but I judge from looking at him that he will make good eating,"
said Fortyforefoot."I couldn't gather from him who he was.He had on a
military uniform, but he behaved less like a warrior than ever I
supposed a man could.It seems from his story that he was engaged upon
some secret mission, and on his way back to his army, he stumbled over
and into one of my game traps where I found him.He begged me to let him
go, but that was out of the question.I haven't had a soldier to eat for
four years, so I took him to the castle, had him locked up in the
ice-box, and to-morrow we shall eat him."asked Bludgeonhead, thoughtfully.He told me so many names that I didn't
believe he really owned any of them," said Fortyforefoot."All I could
really learn about him was that he was as brave as a lion, and that if I
would spare him he would write me a poem a mile long every day of my
life.""Very attractive offer, that," said Bludgeonhead, with a smile."Yes; but I couldn't do it.I wouldn't miss eating him for anything,"
replied Fortyforefoot, smacking his lips, hungrily."I'd give anything
anybody'd ask, too, if I could find another as good.""Well, now, I thought you
would, and that is really what I have come here for.I have in my pocket
here a real live general that I have captured.Now between you and me, I
don't eat generals.I don't care for them--they fight so.I prefer
preserved cherries and pickled peaches and--er--strawberry jam and
powdered sugar and almonds, and other things like that, you know, and it
occurred to me that if I let you have the general you would supply me
with what I needed of the others.""You have come to the right place, Bludgeonhead," said Fortyforefoot,
eagerly."I'll give you a million cans of jam, all the pickled peaches
and other things you can carry if this general you speak about is a fine
specimen.""Well, here he is," said Bludgeonhead, hauling Jimmieboy out of his
pocket--whispering to Jimmieboy at the same time not to be afraid
because he wouldn't let anything happen to him, and so of course
Jimmieboy felt perfectly safe, though a little excited."No," answered Bludgeonhead, putting Jimmieboy back into his pocket
again."If I ever do find another, though, you shall have him."This of course put Fortyforefoot in a tremendously good humor, and
before an hour had passed he had not only transformed pebbles and twigs
and leaves of trees and other small things into the provisions that the
tin soldiers needed, but he had also furnished horses and wagons enough
to carry them back to headquarters, and then Fortyforefoot accompanied
by Bludgeonhead entered the castle, where the proprietor demanded that
Jimmieboy should be given up to him.Bludgeonhead handed him over at once, and ten minutes later Jimmieboy
found himself locked up in the pantry.Hardly had he time to think over the strange events of the afternoon
when he heard a noise in the ice-box over in one corner of the pantry,
and on going there to see what was the cause of it he heard a familiar
voice repeating over and over again these mournful lines:

    "From Giant number one I ran--
       But O the sequel dire!I truly left a frying-pan
       And jumped into a fire.""Hullo in there," whispered Jimmieboy."The bravest man of my time," replied the voice in the ice-box."Major
Mortimer Carraway Blueface of the 'Jimmieboy Guards.'""Oh, I am so glad to find you again," cried Jimmieboy, throwing open the
ice-box door."I thought it was you the minute I heard your poetry.""You recognized the beauty of
the poem?""But you said you were in the fire when I
knew you were in the ice-box, and so of course----"

"Of course," said the major, with a frown."You remembered that when I
say one thing I mean another.Well, I'm glad to see you again, but why
did you desert me so cruelly?"For a moment Jimmieboy could say nothing, so surprised was he at the
major's question.Then he simply repeated it, his amazement very evident
in the tone of his voice."Why did we desert you so cruelly?"When two of my companions
in arms leave me, the way you and old Spriteyboy did, I think you ought
to make some explanation."But we didn't desert you," said Jimmieboy."No such idea ever entered
our minds.The minute Spritey turned into
Bludgeonhead you ran away just about as fast as your tin legs could
carry you--frightened to death evidently.""Jimmieboy," said the major, his voice husky with emotion, "any other
person than yourself would have had to fight a duel with me for casting
such a doubt as you have just cast upon my courage.The idea of me, of
I, of myself, Major Mortimer Carraway Blueface, the hero of a hundred
and eighty-seven real sham fights, the most poetic as well as the
handsomest man in the 'Jimmieboy Guards' being accused of running away!"I've been accused of dreadful things,
     Of wearing copper finger-rings,
     Of eating green peas with a spoon,
     Of wishing that I owned the moon,
     Of telling things that weren't the truth,
     Of having cut no wisdom tooth,
     In times of war of stealing buns,
     And fainting at the sound of guns,
     Yet never dreamed I'd see the day
     When it was thought I'd run away.Alack--O--well-a-day--alas!Alas--O--well-a-day--alack!Alas--alack--O--well-a-day!Aday--alas--O--lack-a-well--"

"Are you going to keep that up forever?""If you are
I'm going to get out.I've heard stupid poetry in this campaign, but
that's the worst yet.""I only wanted to show you what I could do in the way of a lamentation,"
said the major."If you've had enough I'll stop of course; but tell me,"
he added, sitting down upon a cake of ice, and crossing his legs, "how
on earth did you ever get hold of the ridiculous notion that I ran away
frightened?"The minute
the sprite was changed into Bludgeonhead I turned to speak to you, and
all I could see of you was your coat-tails disappearing around the
corner way down the road.""And just because my coat-tails behaved like that you put me down as a
coward?"I hurried
off; but not because I was afraid.I was simply going down the road to
see if I couldn't find a looking-glass so that Spriteyboy could see how
he looked as a giant.""That's a magnificent excuse," he said."I thought you'd think it was," said the major, with a pleased smile."And when I finally found that there weren't any mirrors to be had
along the road I went back, and you two had gone and left me."It's a great thing, sleep is, and I wrote the
lines off in two tenths of a fifth of a second.As I remember it, this
is the way they went:

    "SLEEP.Deserted by my friends I sit,
       And silently I weep,
     Until I'm wearied so by it,
     I lose my little store of wit;
       I nod and fall asleep.Then in my dreams my friends I spy--
       Once more are they my own.I cease to murmur and to cry,
     For then 'tis sure to be that I
       Forget I am alone.'Tis hence I think that sleep's the best
       Of friends that man has got--
      Not only does it bring him rest
     But makes him feel that he is blest
       With blessings he has not.""Why didn't you go to sleep if you felt that way?""I wanted to find you and I hadn't time.There was only time for me to
scratch that poem off on my mind and start to find you and Bludgeyboy,"
replied the major."His name isn't Bludgeyboy," said Jimmieboy, with a smile."Oh, yes, I forgot," said the major."It's a good name, too,
Bludgeonpate is.""How did you come to be captured by Fortyforefoot?"asked Jimmieboy,
after he had decided not to try to correct the major any more as to
Bludgeonhead's name."The idea of a miserable
ogre like Fortyforefoot capturing me, the most sagacitacious soldier of
modern times.I suppose you think I fell into one of his game traps?""That's what he said," said Jimmieboy."He said you acted in a very
curious way, too--promised him all sorts of things if he'd let you go.""That's just like those big, bragging giants," said the major.I came here of my own free will
and accord."Down here into this pantry and into the ice-chest?You can't fool me," said Jimmieboy."To meet you, of course," retorted the major.I knew it
was part of your scheme to come here.You and I were to be put into the
pantry and then old Bludgeyhat was to come and rescue us.I was the one
to make the scheme, wasn't I?"It was Bludgeonhead," said Jimmieboy, who didn't know whether to
believe the major or not."That's just the way," said the major, indignantly, "he gets all the
credit just because he's big and I don't get any, and yet if you knew of
all the wild animals I've killed to get here to you, how I met
Fortyforefoot and bound him hand and foot and refused to let him go
unless he would permit me to spend a week in his ice-chest, for the sole
and only purpose that I wished to meet you again, you'd change your mind
mighty quick about me.""Did you ever see me in a real sham battle?""No, I never did," said Jimmieboy."Well, you'd better never," returned the major, "unless you want to be
frightened out of your wits.I have been called the living telescope,
sir, because when I begin to fight, in the fiercest manner possible, I
sort of lengthen out and sprout up into the air until I am taller than
any foe within my reach."queried Jimmieboy, with a puzzled air about him."Well, I should like to see it once," said Jimmieboy."Then you will never believe it," returned the major, "because you will
never see it.I never fight in the presence of others, sir."As the major spoke these words a heavy footstep was heard on the stairs.cried the major, springing to his feet."I do not ask you for your gold,
       Nor for an old straw hat--
     I simply ask that I be told
       Oh what, oh what is that?""It is a footstep on the stairs," said Jimmieboy.moaned the major "If it is Fortyforefoot all is
over for us."I was afraid he could not wait,
       The miserable sinner,
     To serve me up in proper state
       At his to-morrow's dinner.Alas, he comes I greatly fear
       In search of Major Me, sir,
     And that he'll wash me down with beer
       This very night at tea, sir.""Oh, why did I come here--why----"

"I shall!"roared a voice out in the passage-way."You shall not," roared another voice, which Jimmieboy was delighted to
recognize as Bludgeonhead's."I am hungry," said the first voice, "and what is mine is my own to do
with as I please."I will toss you into the air, my dear Fortyforefoot," returned
Bludgeonhead's voice, "if you advance another step; and with such force,
sir, that you will never come down again."Stand aside," roared the voice of
Fortyforefoot.The two prisoners in the pantry heard a tremendous scuffling, a crash,
and a loud laugh.Then Bludgeonhead's voice was heard again."Good-by, Fortyforefoot," it cried."I hope he is not going to leave us," whispered Jimmieboy, but the major
was too frightened to speak, and he trembled so that half a dozen times
he fell off the ice-cake that he had been sitting on."Give my love to the moon when you pass her, and when you get up into
the milky way turn half a million of the stars there into baked apples
and throw 'em down to me," called Bludgeonhead's voice."If you'll only lasso me and pull me back I'll do anything you want me
to," came the voice of Fortyforefoot from some tremendous height, it
seemed to Jimmieboy."Not if I know it," replied Bludgeonhead, with a laugh."I think I'd
like to settle down here myself as the owner of Fortyforefoot Valley.Whatever answer was made to this it was too indistinct for Jimmieboy to
hear, and in a minute the key of the pantry door was turned, the door
thrown open, and Bludgeonhead stood before them."You are free," he said, grasping Jimmieboy's hand and squeezing it
affectionately."But I had to get rid of him.It was the only way to do
it."And did you really throw him off into the air?"asked Jimmieboy, as he
walked out into the hall.ejaculated Jimmieboy, as he glanced upward and saw a huge rent in
the ceiling, through which, gradually rising and getting smaller and
smaller the further he rose, was to be seen the unfortunate
Fortyforefoot."I simply picked him up and tossed him over
my head.I shall turn myself into Fortyforefoot
and settle down here forever, only instead of being a bad giant I shall
be a good one--but hallo!The major had crawled out of the ice-chest and was now trying to appear
calm, although his terrible fright still left him trembling so that he
could hardly speak."It is Major Blueface," said Jimmieboy, with a smile."He was Fortyforefoot's other prisoner.""N--nun--not at--t--at--at all," stammered the major."I
def--fuf--feated him in sus--single combat.""But what are you trembling so for now?""I--I am--m not tut--trembling," retorted the major."I--I am o--only
sh--shivering with--th--the--c--c--c--cold.I--I--I've bub--been in
th--that i--i--i--ice bu--box sus--so long."Jimmieboy and Bludgeonhead roared with laughter at this.Then giving the
major a warm coat to put on they sent him up stairs to lie down and
recover his nerves.After the major had been attended to, Bludgeonhead changed himself back
into the sprite again, and he and Jimmieboy sauntered in and out among
the gardens for an hour or more and were about returning to the castle
for supper when they heard sounds of music.There was evidently a brass
band coming up the road.In an instant they hid themselves behind a
tree, from which place of concealment they were delighted two or three
minutes later to perceive that the band was none other than that of the
"Jimmieboy Guards," and that behind it, in splendid military form,
appeared Colonel Zinc followed by the tin soldiers themselves.cried Jimmieboy, throwing his cap into the air.shrieked the colonel, waving his sword with delight, and
commanding his regiment to halt, as he caught sight of Jimmieboy.[Illustration: BLUDGEONHEAD COMES TO THE RESCUE.[Blank Page]

"Us likewise!"cheered the soldiers: following which came a trembling
voice from one of the castle windows which said:

    "I also wish to add my cheer
       Upon this happy day;
     And if you'll kindly come up here
       You'll hear me cry 'Hooray.'""No," said the sprite, motioning to Jimmieboy not to betray the major."Only a little worn-out by the fight we have had with Fortyforefoot.""Yes," said the sprite, modestly."We three have got rid of him at
last.""Do you know who
Fortyforefoot really was?"asked Jimmieboy, his curiosity aroused."The Parallelopipedon himself," said the colonel."We found that out
last night, and fearing that he might have captured our general and our
major we came here to besiege him in his castle and rescue our
officers.""But I don't see how Fortyforefoot could have been the
Parallelopipedon," said Jimmieboy."What would he want to be him for,
when, all he had to do to get anything he wanted was to take sand and
turn it into it?""Ah, but don't you see," explained the colonel, "there was one thing he
never could do as Fortyforefoot.The law prevented him from leaving this
valley here in any other form than that of the Parallelopipedon.He
didn't mind his confinement to the valley very much at first, but after
a while he began to feel cooped up here, and then he took an old packing
box and made it look as much like a living Parallelopipedon as he could.Then he got into it whenever he wanted to roam about the world.Probably
if you will search the castle you will find the cast-off shell he used
to wear, and if you do I hope you will destroy it, because it is said to
be a most horrible spectacle--frightening animals to death and causing
every flower within a mile to wither and shrink up at the mere sight of
it.""It's all true, Jimmieboy," said the sprite.Why,
he only gave us those cherries and peaches there in exchange for
yourself because he expected to get them all back again, you know.""It was a glorious victory," said the colonel."I will now announce it
to the soldiers."This he did and the soldiers were wild with joy when they heard the
news, and the band played a hymn of victory in which the soldiers
joined, singing so vigorously that they nearly cracked their voices.When they had quite finished the colonel said he guessed it was time to
return to the barracks in the nursery."Not before the feast," said the sprite."We have here all the
provisions the general set out to get, and before you return home,
colonel, you and your men should divide them among you."So the table was spread and all went happily.In the midst of the feast
the major appeared, determination written upon every line of his face.The soldiers cheered him loudly as he walked down the length of the
table, which he acknowledged as gracefully as he could with a stiff bow,
and then he spoke:

"Gentlemen," he said, "I have always been a good deal of a favorite with
you, and I know that what I am about to do will fill you with deep
grief.I am going to stop being a man of war.The tremendous victory we
have won to-day is the result entirely of the efforts of myself, General
Jimmieboy and Major Sprite--for to the latter I now give the title I
have borne so honorably for so many years.Our present victory is one of
such brilliantly brilliant brilliance that I feel that I may now retire
with lustre enough attached to my name to last for millions and millions
of years.I need rest, and here I shall take it, in this beautiful
valley, which by virtue of our victory belongs wholly and in equal parts
to General Jimmieboy, Major Sprite and myself.Hereafter I shall be
known only as Mortimer Carraway Blueface, Poet Laureate of Fortyforefoot
Hall, Fortyforefoot Valley, Pictureland.As Governor-General of the
country we have decided to appoint our illustrious friend, Major
Benjamin Bludgeonhead Sprite.General Jimmieboy will remain commander of
the forces, and the rest of you may divide amongst yourselves, as a
reward for your gallant services, all the provisions that may now be
left upon this table.That
is that you do not take the table.It is of solid mahogany and must be
worth a very considerable sum.Now let the saddest word be said,
    Now bend in sorrow deep the head.Let tears flow forth and drench the dell:
    Farewell, brave soldier boys, farewell."Here the major wiped his eyes sadly and sat down by the sprite who shook
his hand kindly and thanked him for giving him his title of major."We'll have fine times living here together," said the sprite."I'm going to see if I can't have
myself made over again, too, Spritey.I'll be pleasanter for you to look
at.What's the use of being a tin soldier in a place where even the
cobblestones are of gold and silver.""You can be plated any how," said Jimmieboy."Yes, and maybe I can have a platinum sword put in, and a real solid
gold head--but just at present that isn't what I want," said the major."What I am after now is a piece of birthday cake with real fruit raisins
in it and strips of citron two inches long, the whole concealed beneath
a one inch frosting."I don't think we have any here," said Jimmieboy, who was much pleased
to see the sprite and the major, both of whom he dearly loved, on such
good terms."But I'll run home and see if I can get some.""Well, we'll all go with you," said the colonel, starting up and
ordering the trumpeters to sound the call to arms."All except Blueface and myself," said the sprite."We will stay here
and put everything in readiness for your return.""That is a good idea," said Jimmieboy."And you'll have to hurry for we
shall be back very soon."This, as it turned out, was a very rash promise for Jimmieboy to make,
for after he and the tin soldiers had got the birthday cake and were
ready to enter Pictureland once more, they found that not one of them
could do it, the frame was so high up and the picture itself so hard
and impenetrable.Jimmieboy felt so badly to be unable to return to his
friends, that, following the major's hint about sleep bringing
forgetfulness of trouble, he threw himself down on the nursery couch,
and closing his brimming eyes dozed off into a dreamless sleep.It was quite dark when he opened them again and found himself still on
the couch with a piece of his papa's birthday cake in his hand, his
sorrows all gone and contentment in their place.His papa was sitting at
his side, and his mamma was standing over by the window smiling."You've had a good long nap, Jimmieboy," said she, "and I rather think,
from several things I've heard you say in your sleep, you've been
dreaming about your tin soldiers.""I don't believe it was a dream, mamma," he said, "it was all too real."And then he told his papa all that had happened."Well, it is very singular," said his papa, when Jimmieboy had finished,
"and if you want to believe it all happened you may; but you say all the
soldiers came back with you except Major Blueface?""Yes, every one," said Jimmieboy."Then we can tell whether it was true or not by looking in the tin
soldier's box.If the major isn't there he may be up in Fortyforefoot
castle as you say."Jimmieboy climbed eagerly down from the couch and rushing to the toy
closet got out the box of soldiers and searched it from top to bottom.The major was not to be seen anywhere, nor to this day has Jimmieboy
ever again set eyes upon him.Transcriber's Note:

myself away to the place where I was found yesterday more dead than
alive.I did not kill my mate; I never raised my hand against him.What I have said is the truth, as I hope for mercy in the next world,
if I don't get it in this!"This was the incredible story related to me by the villain who had
threatened the life of the woman I loved; for he did not deceive me;
murder was in his heart, and his low cunning only served to show him
in a blacker light.I
released him from the spell I had cast upon him, and he stood before
me, shaking and trembling, with a look in his eyes as though he had
just been awakened from sleep."You have confessed all," I said, meeting cunning with cunning.Then I told him that he had made a full confession of his crime, and
in the telling expounded my own theory, as if it had come from his
lips, of the thoughts which led to it, and of its final committal--my
hope being that he would even now admit that he was the murderer."If I have said as much," he said, "it is you who have driven me to
it, and it is you who have come here to set a snare for my
destruction.But it is not possible, because what you have told me is
false from beginning to end."So I left him, amazed at his dogged, determined obstinacy, which I
knew would not avail him.I have been reading over the record I have written of my life, which
has been made with care and a strict adherence to the truth.I am at
the present hour sitting alone in the house I have taken and
furnished, and to which I hope shortly to bring my beloved Lauretta as
my wife.The writing of this record from time to time has grown into a
kind of habit with me, and there are occasions in which I have been
greatly interested in it myself.Never until this night have I read
the record from beginning to end, and I have come to a resolution to
discontinue it.My reason is a sufficient one, and as it concerns no
man else, no man can dispute my right to make it.My resolution is, after to-morrow, to allow my new life, soon to
commence, to flow on uninterruptedly without burdening myself with the
labour of putting into writing the happy experiences awaiting me.I
shall be no longer alone; Lauretta will be by my side; I should
begrudge the hours which deprived me of her society.I must have no secrets from her; and much that here is
recorded should properly be read by no eye than mine.Lauretta's
nature is so gentle, her soul so pure, that it would distress her to
read these pages.I recognise a certain morbid vein
in myself which the continuing of this record might magnify into a
disease.It presents itself to me in the light of guarding myself
against myself, by adopting wise measures to foster cheerfulness.That
my nature is more melancholy than cheerful is doubtless to be ascribed
to the circumstances of my child-life, which was entirely devoid of
light and gaiety.This must not be in the future; I have a battle to
fight, and I shall conquer because Lauretta's happiness is on the
issue.It will, however, be as well to make the record complete in a certain
sense, and I shall therefore take note of certain things which have
occurred since my conversation with Pierre in his cell.That done, I
shall put these papers aside in a secret place, and shall endeavour to
forget them.My first thought was to destroy the record, but I was
influenced in the contrary direction by the fact that my first meeting
with Lauretta and the growth of my love for her are described in it.First impressions jotted down at the time of their occurrence have a
freshness about them which can never be imparted by the aid of memory,
and it may afford me pleasure in the future to live over again,
through these pages, the sweet days of my early intimacy with my
beloved girl.Then there is the strange story of Kristel and Silvain,
which undoubtedly is worth preserving.First, to get rid of the miserable affair of the attempt to rob Doctor
Louis's house.Pierre was tried and convicted, and has paid the
penalty of his crime.His belief in the possession of a soul could
not, after all, have had in it the spirit of sincerity; it must have
been vaunted merely in pursuance of his cunning endeavours to escape
his just punishment; otherwise he would have confessed before he died.Father Daniel, the good priest, did all he could to bring the man to
repentance, but to the last he insisted that he was innocent.It was
strange to me to hear Father Daniel express himself sympathetically
towards the criminal."He laboured, up to the supreme moment," said the good priest, in a
compassionate tone, "under the singular hallucination that he was
going before his Maker guiltless of the shedding of blood.So fervent
and apparently sincere were his protestations that I could not help
being shaken in my belief that he was guilty.""Not in the sense," said Father Daniel, "that the unhappy man would
have had me believe.Reason rejects his story as something altogether
too incredulous; and yet I pity him."I did not prolong the discussion with the good priest; it would have
been useless, and, to Father Daniel, painful.We looked at the matter
from widely different standpoints.Intolerance warps the judgment; no
less does such a life as Father Daniel has lived, for ever seeking to
find excuses for error and crime, for ever seeking to palliate a man's
misdeeds.Sweetness of disposition, carried to extremes, may
degenerate into positive mental feebleness; to my mind this is the
case with Father Daniel.He is not the kind who, in serious matters,
can be depended upon for a just estimate of human affairs.Eric and Emilius, after a longer delay than Doctor Louis anticipated,
have taken up their residence in Nerac.They paid two short visits to
the village, and I was in hopes each time upon their departure that
they had relinquished their intention of living in Nerac.I did not
give expression to my wish, for I knew it was not shared by any member
of Doctor Louis's family.It is useless to disguise that I dislike them, and that there exists
between us a certain antipathy.To be just, this appears to be more on
my side than on theirs, and it is not in my disfavour that the
feelings I entertain are nearer the surface.Doctor Louis and the
ladies entertain a high opinion of them; I do not; and I have already
some reason for looking upon them with a suspicious eye.When we were first introduced it was natural that I should regard them
with interest, an interest which sprang from the story of their
father's fateful life.They bear a wonderful resemblance to each other
they are both fair, with tawny beards, which it appears to me they
take a pride in shaping and trimming alike; their eyes are blue, and
they are of exactly the same height.Undoubtedly handsome men, having
in that respect the advantage of me, who, in point of attractive
looks, cannot compare with them.They seem to be devotedly attached to
each other, but this may or may not be.So were Silvain and Kristel
until a woman stepped between them and changed their love to hate.Before I came into personal relationship with Eric and Emilius I made
up my mind to distrust appearances and to seek for evidence upon which
to form an independent judgment.Some such evidence has already come
to me, and I shall secretly follow it up.They are on terms of the most affectionate intimacy with Doctor Louis
and his family, and both Lauretta and Lauretta's mother take pleasure
in their society; Doctor Louis, also, in a lesser degree.Women are
always more effusive than men.They are not aware of the relations which bind me to the village.That
they may have some suspicion of my feelings for Lauretta is more than
probable, for I have seen them look from her to me and then at each
other, and I have interpreted these looks.It is as if they said, "Why
is this stranger here?I have begged Doctor
Louis to allow me to speak openly to Lauretta, and he has consented to
shorten the period of silence to which I was pledged.I have his
permission to declare my love to his daughter to-morrow.There are no
doubts in my mind that she will accept me; but there _are_ doubts that
if I left it too late there would be danger that her love for me would
be weakened.Yes, although it is torture to me to admit it I cannot
rid myself of this impression.By these brothers, Eric and Emilius, and by means of misrepresentations
to my injury.I have no positive data to go upon, but I am convinced
that they have an aversion towards me, and that they are in their hearts
jealous of me.The doctor is blind to their true character; he believes
them to be generous and noble-minded, men of rectitude and high
principle.I have the evidence of my senses in proof
of it.So much have I been disturbed and unhinged by my feelings towards
these brothers--feelings which I have but imperfectly expressed--that
latterly I have frequently been unable to sleep.Impossible to lie
abed and toss about for hours in an agony of unrest; therefore I chose
the lesser evil, and resumed the nocturnal wanderings which was my
habit in Rosemullion before the death of my parents.These nightly
rambles have been taken in secret, as in the days of my boyhood, and I
mused and spoke aloud as was my custom during that period of my life.But I had new objects to occupy me now--the home in which I hoped to
enjoy a heaven of happiness, with Lauretta its guiding star, and all
the bright anticipations of the future.I strove to confine myself to
these dreams, which filled my soul with joy, but there came to me
always the figures of Eric and Emilius, dark shadows to threaten my
promised happiness.Last week it was, on a night in which I felt that sleep would not be
mine if I sought my couch; therefore, earlier than usual--it was
barely eleven o'clock--I left the house, and went into the woods.Martin Hartog and his fair daughter were in the habit of retiring
early and rising with the sun, and I stole quietly away unobserved.At
twelve o'clock I turned homewards, and when I was about a hundred
yards from my house I was surprised to hear a low murmur of voices
within a short distance of me.Since the night on which I visited the
Three Black Crows and saw the two strangers there who had come to
Nerac with evil intent, I had become very watchful, and now these
voices speaking at such an untimely hour thoroughly aroused me.I
stepped quietly in their direction, so quietly that I knew I could not
be heard, and presently I saw standing at a distance of ten or twelve
yards the figures of a man and a woman.The man was Emilius, the woman
Martin Hartog's daughter.Although I had heard their voices before I reached the spot upon which
I stood when I recognised their forms, I could not even now determine
what they said, they spoke in such low tones.So I stood still and
watched them and kept myself from their sight.I may say honestly that
I should not have been guilty of the meanness had it not been that I
entertain an unconquerable aversion against Eric and Emilius.I was
sorry to see Martin Hartog's daughter holding a secret interview with
a man at midnight, for the girl had inspired me with a respect of
which I now knew she was unworthy; but I cannot aver that I was sorry
to see Emilius in such a position, for it was an index to his
character and a justification of the unfavourable opinion I had formed
of him and Eric.Alike as they were in physical presentment, I had no
doubt that their moral natures bore the same kind of resemblance.Libertines both of them, ready for any low intrigue, and holding in
light regard a woman's good name and fame.Truly the picture before me
showed clearly the stuff of which these brothers are made.If they
hold one woman's good name so lightly, they hold all women so.Fit
associates, indeed, for a family so pure and stainless as Doctor
Louis's!This was no chance meeting--how was that possible at such an hour?Theirs was no new acquaintanceship; it must have
lasted already some time.The very secrecy of the interview was in
itself a condemnation.Should I make Doctor Louis acquainted with the true character of the
brothers who held so high a place in his esteem?This was the question
that occurred to me as I gazed upon Emilius and Martin Hartog's
daughter, and I soon answered it in the negative.Doctor Louis was a
man of settled convictions, hard to convince, hard to turn.His first
impulse, upon which he would act, would be to go straight to Emilius,
and enlighten him upon the discovery I had made.Why, then,
Emilius would invent some tale which it would not be hard to believe,
and make light of a matter I deemed so serious.I should be placed in
the position of an eavesdropper, as a man setting sly watches upon
others to whom, from causeless grounds, I had taken a dislike.Whatever the result one thing was
certain--that I was a person capable not only of unreasonable
antipathies but of small meannesses to which a gentleman would not
descend.The love which Doctor Louis bore to Silvain, and which he had
transferred to Silvain's children, was not to be easily turned; and at
the best I should be introducing doubts into his mind which would
reflect upon myself because of the part of spy I had played.No; I
decided for the present at least, to keep  the knowledge to myself.As to Martin Hartog, though I could not help feeling pity for him, it
was for him, not me, to look after his daughter.From a general point
of view these affairs were common enough.I seemed to see now in a clearer light the kind of man Silvain
was--one who would set himself deliberately to deceive where most he
was trusted.Honour, fair dealing, brotherly love, were as nought in
his eyes where a woman was concerned, and he had transmitted these
qualities to Eric and Emilius.My sympathy for Kristel was deepened by
what I was gazing on; more than ever was I convinced of the justice of
the revenge he took upon the brother who had betrayed him.These were the thoughts which passed through my mind while Emilius and
Martin Hartog's daughter stood conversing.Presently they strolled
towards me, and I shrank back in fear of being discovered.This
involuntary action on my part, being an accentuation of the meanness
of which I was guilty, confirmed me in the resolution at which I had
arrived to say nothing of my discovery to Doctor Louis.They passed me in silence, walking in the direction of my house.I did
not follow them, and did not return home for another hour.How shall I describe the occurrences of this day, the most memorable
and eventful in my life?I am
overwhelmed at the happiness which is within my grasp.As I walked
home from Doctor Louis's house through the darkness a spirit walked by
my side, illumining the gloom and filling my heart with gladness.At one o'clock I presented myself at Doctor Louis's house.He met me
at the door, expecting me, and asked me to come with him to a little
room he uses as a study.His face was
grave, and but for its kindly expression I should have feared it was
his intention to revoke the permission he had given me to speak to his
daughter on this day of the deep, the inextinguishable love I bear for
her.He motioned me to a chair, and I seated myself and waited for him
to speak."This hour," he said, "is to me most solemn.""And to me, sir," I responded."It should be," he said, "to you perhaps, more than to me; but we are
inclined ever to take the selfish view.I have been awake very nearly
the whole of the night, and so has my wife.Our conversation--well,
you can guess the object of it.""Yes, Lauretta, our only child, whom you are about to take from us."I
trembled with joy, his words betokening a certainty that Lauretta
loved me, an assurance I had yet to receive from her own sweet lips."My wife and I," he continued, "have been living over again the life
of our dear one, and the perfect happiness we have drawn from her.I
am not ashamed to say that we have committed some weaknesses during
these last few hours, weaknesses springing from our affection for our
Home Rose.In the future some such experience may be yours, and then
you will know--which now is hidden from you--what parents feel who are
asked to give their one ewe lamb into the care of a stranger.""There is no reason for alarm, Gabriel," he said, "because I
have used a true word.Until a few short months ago you were really a
stranger to us.""That has not been against me, sir," I said, "and is not, I trust.""There is no such thought in my mind, Gabriel.There is nothing
against you except--except," he repeated, with a little pitiful smile,
"that you are about to take from us our most precious possession.Until to-day our dear child was wholly and solely ours; and not only
herself, but her past was ours, her past, which has been to us a
garden of joy.Henceforth her heart will be divided, and you will have
the larger share.That is a great deal to think of, and we have
thought of it, my wife and I, and talked of it nearly all the night.Certain treasures," he said, and again the pitiful smile came on his
lips, "which in the eyes of other men and women are valueless, still
are ours."He opened a drawer, and gazed with loving eyes upon its
contents."Such as a little pair of shoes, a flower or two, a lock of
her bright hair."I asked, profoundly touched by the loving accents
of his voice."Surely," he replied, and he passed over to me a lock of golden hair,
which I pressed to my lips."The little head was once covered with
these golden curls, and to us, her parents, they were as holy as they
would have been on the head of an angel.She was all that to us,
Gabriel.It is within the scope of human love to lift one's thoughts
to heaven and God; it is within its scope to make one truly fit for
the life to come.All things are not of the world worldly; it is a
grievous error to think so, and only sceptics can so believe.In the
kiss of baby lips, in the touch of little hands, in the myriad sweet
ways of childhood, lie the breath of a pure religion which God
receives because of its power to sanctify the lowest as well as the
highest of human lives.It is good to think of that, and to feel that,
in the holiest forms of humanity, the poor stand as high as the rich.""Gabriel, it is an idle phrase
for a father holding the position towards you which I do at the
present moment, to say he has no fears for the happiness of his only
child.""If you have any, sir," I said, "question me, and let me endeavour to
set your mind at ease.In one respect I can do so with solemn
earnestness.If it be my happy lot to win your daughter, her welfare,
her honour, her peace of mind, shall be the care of my life.I love Lauretta with a pure heart;
no other woman has ever possessed my love; to no other woman have I
been drawn; nor is it possible that I could be.She is to me part of
my spiritual life.I am not as other men, in the ordinary acceptation.In my childhood's life there was but little joy, and the common
pleasures of childhood were not mine.From almost my earliest
remembrances there was but little light in my parents' house, and in
looking back upon it I can scarcely call it a home.The fault was not
mine, as you will admit.May I claim some small merit--not of my own
purposed earning, but because it was in me, for which I may have
reason to be grateful--from the fact that the circumstances of my
early life did not corrupt me, did not drive me to a searching for low
pleasures, and did not debase me?It seemed to me, sir, that I was
ever seeking for something in the heights and not in the depths.Books
and study were my comforters, and I derived real pleasures from them.They served to satisfy a want, and, although I contracted a melancholy
mood, I was not unhappy.I know that this mood is in me, but when I
think of Lauretta it is dispelled.I seem to hear the singing of
birds, to see flowers around me, to bathe in sunshine.Perhaps it
springs from the fervour of my love for her; but a kind of belief is
mine that I have been drawn hither to her, that my way of life was
measured to her heart."You have said much," said Doctor Louis, "to comfort and assure me,
and have, without being asked, answered questions which were in my
mind.Do you remember a conversation you had with my wife in the first
days of your convalescence, commenced I think by you in saying that
the happiest dream of your life was drawing to a close?"Even in those early days I felt that I
loved her.""I understand that now," said Doctor Louis."My wife replied that life
must not be dreamt away, that it has duties.""My wife said that one's ease and pleasures are rewards, only
enjoyable when they have been worthily earned; and when you asked,
'Earned in what way?'she answered, 'In accomplishing one's work in
the world.'""Yes, sir, her words come back to me.""There is something more," said Doctor Louis, with sad sweetness,
"which I should not recall did I not hold duty before me as my chief
beacon.Inclination and selfish desire must often be sacrificed for
it.You will understand how sadly significant this is to me when I
recall what followed.Though, to be sure," he added, in a slightly
gayer tone, "we could visit you and our daughter, wherever your abode
happened to be.Continuing your conversation with my wife, you said,
'How to discover what one's work really is, and where it should be
properly performed?'My wife answered, 'In one's native land.'""Those were the words we spoke to one another, sir.""It was my wife who recalled them to me, and I wish you--in the event
of your hopes being realised--to bear them in mind.It would be
painful to me to see you lead an idle life, and it would be injurious
to you.This quiet village opens out no opportunities to you; it is
too narrow, too confined.I have found my place here as an active
worker, but I doubt if you would do so.""There is time to think of it, sir."And now, if you like, we will join my wife and
daughter.""Have you said anything to Lauretta, sir?"I thought it best, and so did her mother, that her heart should
be left to speak for itself."Lauretta's mother received me with tender, wistful solicitude, and I
observed nothing in Lauretta to denote that she had been prepared for
the declaration I had come to make.After lunch I proposed to Lauretta
to go out into the garden, and she turned to her mother and asked if
she would accompany us."No, my child," said the mother, "I have things in the house to attend
to."It was a lovely day, and Lauretta had thrown a light lace scarf over
her head.She was in gay spirits, not boisterous, for she is ever
gentle, and she endeavoured to entertain me with innocent prattle, to
which I found it difficult to respond.In a little while this forced
itself upon her observation, and she asked me if I was not well."I am quite well, Lauretta," I replied."Then something has annoyed you," she said.No, I answered, nothing had annoyed me."But there _is_ something," she said."Yes," I said, "there _is_ something."We were standing by a rosebush, and I plucked one absently, and
absently plucked the leaves.She looked at me in silence for a moment
or two and said, "This is the first time I have ever seen you destroy
a flower.""I was not thinking of it," I said; and was about to throw it away
when an impulse, born purely of love for what was graceful and sweet,
restrained me, and I put it into my pocket.In this the most
impressive epoch in my life no sentiment but that of tenderness could
hold a place in my heart and mind."Lauretta," I said, taking her hand, which she left willingly in mine,
"will you listen to the story of my life?""You have already told me much," she said."You have heard only a part," I said, and I gently urged her to a
seat."I wish you to know all; I wish you to know me as I really am.""I know you as you really are," she said, and then a faint colour came
to her cheeks, and she trembled slightly, seeing a new meaning in my
earnest glances."Yes," she said, and gently withdrew her hand from mine.I told her all, withholding only from her those mysterious promptings
of my lonely hours which I knew would distress her, and to which I was
convinced, with her as my companion through life, there would be for
ever an end.Of even those promptings I gave her some insight, but so
toned down--for her sweet sake, not for mine--as to excite only her
sympathy.Apart from this, I was at sincere pains that she should see
my life as it had really been, a life stripped of the joys of
childhood; a life stripped of the light of home; a life dependent upon
itself for comfort and support.Then, unconsciously, and out of the
suffering of my soul--for as I spoke it seemed to me that a cruel
wrong had been perpetrated upon me in the past--I contrasted the young
life I had been condemned to live with that of a child who was blessed
with parents whose hearts were animated by a love the evidences of
which would endure all through his after life as a sweet and purifying
influence.The tears ran down her cheeks as I dwelt upon this part of
my story.Then I spoke of the happy chance which had conducted me to
her home, and of the happiness I had experienced in my association
with her and hers."Whatever fate may be mine," I said, "I shall never reflect upon these
experiences, I shall never think of your dear parents, without
gratitude and affection.Lauretta, it is with their permission I am
here now by your side.It is with their permission that I am opening
my heart to you.I love you, Lauretta,
and if you will bless me with your love, and place your hand in mine,
all my life shall be devoted to your happiness.You can bring a
blessing into my days; I will strive to bring a blessing into yours."My arm stole round her waist; her head drooped to my shoulder, so that
her face was hidden from my ardent gaze; the hand I clasped was not
withdrawn."Lauretta," I whispered, "say 'I love you, Gabriel.'""I love you, Gabriel," she whispered; and heaven itself opened out to
me.Half an hour later we went in to her mother, and the noble woman held
out her arms to her daughter.As the maiden nestled to her breast, she
said, holding out a hand to me, which I reverently kissed, "God in His
mercy keep guard over you!*   *   *   *   *

These are my last written words in the record I have kept.From this
day I commence a new life.IN WHICH THE SECRET OF THE INHERITANCE TRANSMITTED TO GABRIEL CAREW IS
REVEALED IN A SERIES OF LETTERS FROM ABRAHAM SANDIVAL, ESQ., ENGLAND,
TO HIS FRIEND, MAXIMILIAN GALLENGA, ESQ., CONTRA COSTA CO.,
CALIFORNIA.I.


My Dear Max,--For many months past you have complained that I have
been extremely reticent upon domestic matters, and that I have said
little or nothing concerning my son Reginald, who, since you quitted
the centres of European civilisation to bury yourself in a sparsely
populated Paradise, has grown from childhood to manhood.A ripe
manhood, my dear Max, such as I, his father, approve of, and to the
future development of which, now that a grave and strange crisis in
his life has come to a happy ending, I look forward with loving
interest.It is, I know, your affection for Reginald that causes you
to be anxious for news of him.Well do I remember when you informed me
of your fixed resolution to seek not only new scenes but new modes of
life, how earnestly you strove to prevail upon me to allow him to
accompany you."He is young and plastic," you said, "and I can train him to
happiness.The fewer the wants, the more contented the lot of man."You wished to educate Reginald according to the primitive views to
which you had become so strongly wedded, and you did your best to
convert me to them, saying, I remember, that I should doubtless suffer
in parting with Reginald, but that it was a father's duty to make
sacrifices for his children.My belief was, and
is, that man is born to progress, and that to go back into
primitiveness, to commence again, as it were, the history of the world
and mankind, as though we had been living in error through all the
centuries, is a folly.I did not apply this criticism to you; I
regarded your new departure not as a folly, but as a mistake.I doubt
even now whether it has made you happier than you were, and I fancy
I detect here and there in your letters a touch of sadness and
regret--of which perhaps you are unconscious--that you should have cut
yourself away from the busy life of multitudes of people.However, it
is not my purpose now to enlarge upon this theme.The history I am
about to relate is personal to myself and to Reginald, whose destiny
it has been to come into close contact with a family, the head of
which, Gabriel Carew, affords a psychological study as strange
probably as was ever presented to the judgment of mankind.There are various reasons for my undertaking a task which will occupy
a great deal of time and entail considerable labour.The labour will
be interesting to me, and its products no less interesting to you, who
were always fond of the mystical.I have leisure to apply myself to
it.Reginald is not at present with me; he has left me for a few weeks
upon a mission of sunshine.This will sound enigmatical to you, but
you must content yourself with the gradual and intelligible unfolding
of the wonderful story I am about to narrate.Like a skilful narrator
I shall not weaken the interest by giving information and presenting
pictures to you in the wrong places.The history is one which it is my
opinion should not be lost to the world; its phases are so remarkable
that it will open up a field of inquiry which may not be without
profitable results to those who study psychological mysteries.A few
years hence I should not be able to recall events in their logical
order; I therefore do so while I possess the power and while my memory
is clear with respect to them.You will soon discover that neither I nor Reginald is the principal
character in this drama of life.Gabriel Carew, the owner of an estate in the county of Kent, known as
Rosemullion.My labours will be thrown away unless you are prepared to read what I
shall write with unquestioning faith.I shall set down nothing but the
truth, and you must accept it without a thought of casting doubt upon
it.That you will wonder and be amazed is certain; it would, indeed,
be strange otherwise; for in all your varied experiences (you led a
busy and eventful life before you left us) you met with none so
singular and weird as the events which I am about to bring to your
knowledge.You must accept also--as the best and most suitable form
through which you will be made familiar not only with the personality
of Gabriel Carew, but with the mysterious incidents of his life--the
methods I shall adopt in the unfolding of my narrative.They are such
as are frequently adopted with success by writers of fiction, and as
my material is fact, I am justified in pressing it into my service.I
am aware that objection may be taken to it on the ground that I shall
be presenting you with conversations between persons of which I was
not a witness, but I do not see in what other way I could offer you an
intelligent and intelligible account of the circumstances of the
story.All that I can therefore do is to promise that I will keep a
strict curb upon my imagination and will not allow it to encroach upon
the domains of truth.With this necessary prelude I devote myself to
my task.Before, however, myself commencing the work there is something
essential for you to do.Accompanying my own manuscript is a packet,
carefully sealed and secured, on the outer sheet of which is written,
"Not to be disturbed or opened until instructions to do so are given
by Abraham Sandival to his friend Maximilian Gallenofa."The
precaution is sufficient to whet any man's curiosity, but is not taken
to that end.It is simply in pursuance of the plan I have designed, by
which you will become possessed of all the details and particulars for
the proper understanding of what I shall impart to you.The packet, my
dear Max, is neither more nor less than a life record made by Gabriel
Carew himself up to within a few months of his marriage, which took
place twenty years ago in the village of Nerac.The lady Gabriel Carew
married was the daughter of Doctor Louis, a gentleman of rare
acquirements, and distinguished both for his learning and benevolence.There is no evidence in the record as to whether its recital was
spread over a number of years, or was begun and finished within a few
months; but that matters little.It bears the impress of absolute
truth and candour, and apart from its startling revelations you will
recognise in it a picturesqueness of description hardly to be expected
from one who had not made a study of literature.Its perusal will
perplexedly stir your mind, and in the feelings it will excite towards
Gabriel Carew there will most likely be an element of pity, the reason
for which you will find it difficult to explain."Season your
admiration for a while;" before I am at the end of my task the riddle
will be solved.As I pen these words I can realise your perplexity during your perusal
of the record as to the manner in which my son Reginald came be
associated with so strange a man as the writer.But this is a world of
mystery, and we can never hope to find a key to its spiritual
workings.With respect to this particular mystery nothing shall be
hidden from you.You will learn how I came to be mixed up in it; you
will learn how vitally interwoven it threatened to be in Reginald's
life; you will learn how Gabriel Carew's manuscript fell into my
hands; and the mystery of his life will be revealed to you.Now, my dear Max, you can unfasten the packet, and read the record.I assume that you are now familiar with the story of Gabriel Carew's
life up to the point, or within a few months, of his marriage with
Lauretta, and that you have formed some opinion of the different
persons with whom he came in contact in Nerac.Outside Nerac there was
only one person who can be said to have been interested in his fate;
this was his mother's nurse, Mrs.Fortress, and you must be deeply
impressed by the part she played in the youthful life of Gabriel
Carew.Of her I shall have to speak in due course.I transport you in fancy to Nerac, my dear Max, where I have been not
very long ago, and where I conversed with old people who to this day
remember Gabriel Carew and his sweet wife Lauretta, whom he brought
with him to England some little time after their marriage.It is not
likely that the incidents in connection with Gabriel Carew and his
wife will be forgotten during this generation or the next in that
loveliest of villages.When you laid aside Carew's manuscript he had received the sanction of
Lauretta's mother to his engagement with the sweet maid, and the good
woman had given her children her blessing.Thereafter Gabriel Carew
wrote: "These are my last written words in the record I have kept.He kept his word with respect to
his resolve not to add another word to the record.He sealed it up and
deposited it in his desk; and it is my belief that from that day he
never read a line of its contents.We are, then, my dear Max, in Nerac, you and I in spirit, in the
holiday time of the open courtship of Gabriel Carew and Lauretta.Carew is occupying the house of which it was his intention to make
Lauretta the mistress, and there are residing in it, besides the
ordinary servants, Martin Hartog, the gardener, and his daughter, with
whom, from Carew's record, Emilius was supposed to be carrying on an
intrigue of a secret and discreditable nature.It is evident, from the
manner in which Carew referred to it, that he considered it
dishonourable.There remain to be mentioned, as characters in the drama then being
played, Doctor Louis, Eric, and Father Daniel.The crimes of the two ruffians who had attempted to enter Doctor
Louis's house remained for long fresh in the memories of the
villagers.They were both dead, one murdered, the other executed for a
deed of which only one person in Nerac had an uneasy sense of his
innocence--Father Daniel.The good priest, having received from the
unfortunate man a full account of his life from childhood, journeyed
shortly afterwards to the village in which he had been born and was
best known, for the purpose of making inquiries into its truth.He
found it verified in every particular, and he learnt, moreover, that
although the hunchback had been frequently in trouble, it was rather
from sheer wretchedness and poverty than from any natural brutality of
disposition that he had drifted into crime.It stood to his credit
that Father Daniel could trace to him no acts of cruel violence;
indeed, the priest succeeded in bringing to light two or three
circumstances in the hunchback's career which spoke well for his
humanity, one of them being that he was kind to his bedridden mother.Father Daniel returned to Nerac much shaken by the reflection that in
this man's case justice had been in error.But if this were so, if the
hunchback were innocent, upon whom to fix the guilt?A sadness weighed
upon the good priest's heart as he went about his daily duties, and
gazed upon his flock with an awful suspicion in his mind that there
was a murderer among them, for whose crime an innocent man had been
executed.The gloom of his early life, which threatened
to cast dark shadows over all his days, seemed banished for ever.He
was liked and respected in the village in which he had found his
happiness; his charities caused men and women to hold him in something
like affectionate regard; he was Father Daniel's friend, and no case
of suffering or poverty was mentioned to him which he was not ready to
relieve; in Doctor Louis's home he held an honoured place; and he was
loved by a good and pure woman, who had consented to link her fate
with his.Surely in this prospect there was nothing that could be
productive of aught but good.The sweetness and harmony of the time, however, were soon to be
disturbed.After a few weeks of happiness, Gabriel Carew began to be
troubled.In his heart he had no love for the twin brothers, Eric and
Emilius; he believed them to be light-minded and unscrupulous, nay,
more, he believed them to be treacherous in their dealings with both
men and women.These evil qualities, he had decided with himself, they
had inherited from their father, Silvain, whose conduct towards his
unhappy brother Kristel had excited Gabriel Carew's strong abhorrence.As is shown in the comments he makes in his record, all his sympathy
was with Kristel, and he had contracted a passionate antipathy against
Silvain, whom he believed to be guilty of the blackest treachery in
his dealings with Avicia.This antipathy he now transferred to
Silvain's sons, Eric and Emilius, and they needed to be angels, not
men, to overcome it.Not that they tried to win Carew's good opinion.Although his feelings
for them were not openly expressed, they made themselves felt in the
consciousness of these twin brothers, who instinctively recognised
that Gabriel Carew was their enemy.Therefore they held off from him,
and repaid him quietly in kind.But this was a matter solely and
entirely between themselves and known only to themselves.The three
men knew what deep pain and grief it would cause not only Doctor Louis
and his wife, but the gentle Lauretta, to learn that they were in
enmity with each other, and one and all were animated by the same
desire to keep this antagonism from the knowledge of the family.This
was, indeed, a tacit understanding between them, and it was so
thoroughly carried out that no member of Doctor Louis's family
suspected it; and neither was it suspected in the village.To all
outward appearance Gabriel Carew and Eric and Emilius were friends.It was not the brothers but Carew who, in the first instance, was to
blame.He was the originator and the creator of the trouble, for it is
scarcely to be doubted that had he held out the hand of a frank
friendship to them, they would have accepted it, even though their
acceptance needed some sacrifice on their parts.The reason for this
qualification will be apparent to you later on in the story, and you
will then also understand why I do not reveal certain circumstances
respecting the affection of Eric and Emilius for Martin Hartog's
daughter, Patricia, and for the female members of the family of Doctor
Louis.I am relating the story in the
order in which it progressed, and, so far as my knowledge of it goes,
according to the sequence of time.Certainly the dominant cause of Gabriel Carew's hatred for the
brothers sprang from his jealousy of them with respect to Lauretta.They and she had been friends from childhood, and they were regarded
by Doctor Louis and his wife as members of their family.This in
itself was sufficient to inflame so exacting a lover as Carew.He
interpreted every innocent little familiarity to their disadvantage,
and magnified trifles inordinately.They saw his sufferings and were,
perhaps, somewhat scornful of them.He had already shown them how deep
was his hatred of them, and they not unnaturally resented it.After
all, he was a stranger in Nerac, a come-by-chance visitor, who had
usurped the place which might have been occupied by one of them had
the winds been fair.Instead of being overbearing and arrogant he
should have been gracious and conciliating.It was undoubtedly his
duty to be courteous and mannerly from the first day of their
acquaintance; instead of which he had, before he saw them, contracted
a dislike for them which he had allowed to swell to monstrous and
unjustifiable proportions.Gabriel Carew, however, justified himself to himself, and it may be
at once conceded that he had grounds for his feelings which were to
him--and would likely have been to some other men--sufficient.When a lover's suspicious and jealous nature is aroused it does not
from that moment sleep.There is no rest, no repose for it.If it
require opportunities for confirmation or for the infliction of
self-suffering, it is never difficult to find them.Imagination steps
in and supplies the place of fact.Every hour is a torture; every
innocent look and smile is brooded over in secret.A most prolific,
unreasonable, and cruel breeder of shadows is jealousy, and the evil
of it is that it breeds in secret.Gabriel Carew set himself to watch, and from the keen observance of a
nature so thorough and intense as his nothing could escape.He was an
unseen witness of other interviews between Patricia Hartog and
Emilius; and not only of interviews between her and Emilius but
between her and Eric.The brothers were
playing false to each other, and the girl was playing false with both.This was of little account; he had no more than a passing interest in
Patricia, and although at one time he had some kind of intention of
informing Martin Hartog of these secret interviews, and placing the
father on his guard--for the gardener seemed to be quite unaware that
an intrigue was going on--he relinquished the intention, saying that
it was no affair of his.But it confirmed the impressions he had
formed of the character of Eric and Emilius, and it strengthened him
in his determination to allow no intercourse between them and the
woman he loved.An additional torture was in store for him, and it fell upon him like
a thunderbolt.One day he saw Emilius and Lauretta walking in the
woods, talking earnestly and confidentially together.His blood
boiled; his heart beat so violently that he could scarcely distinguish
surrounding objects.So violent was his agitation that it was many
minutes before he recovered himself, and then Lauretta and Emilius had
passed out of sight.He went home in a wild fury of despair.He had not been near enough to hear one word of the conversation, but
their attitude was to him confirmation of his jealous suspicion that
the young man was endeavouring to supplant him in Lauretta's
affections.In the evening he saw Lauretta in her home, and she
noticed a change in him."No," he replied, "I am quite well.The bitterness in his voice surprised her, and she insisted that he
should seek repose."To get me out of the way," he thought; and then,
gazing into her solicitous and innocent eyes, he mutely reproached
himself for doubting her.No, it was not she who was to blame; she was
still his, she was still true to him; but how easy was it for a friend
so close to her as Emilius to instil into her trustful heart evil
reports against himself!"That is the first step," he thought.These men, these villains, are capable of any
treachery.Honour is a stranger to their scheming natures.To meet them openly, to accuse them openly, may be my ruin.They are too firmly fixed in the affections of Doctor Louis and his
wife--they are too firmly fixed in the affections of even Lauretta
herself--for me to hope to expose them upon evidence so slender.Not
slender to me, but to them.These treacherous brothers are conspiring
secretly against me.I will wait and watch till I have the strongest proof
against them, and then I will expose their true characters to Doctor
Louis and Lauretta."Having thus resolved, he was not the man to swerve from the plan he
laid down.The nightly vigils he had kept in his young life served him
now, and it seemed as if he could do without sleep.The stealthy
meetings between Patricia and the brothers continued, and before long
he saw Eric and Lauretta in the woods together.In his espionage he
was always careful not to approach near enough to bring discovery upon
himself.In an indirect manner, as though it was a matter which he deemed of
slight importance, he questioned Lauretta as to her walks in the woods
with Eric and Emilius."Yes," she said artlessly, "we sometimes meet there.""Not always by accident," replied Lauretta."Remember, Gabriel, Eric
and Emilius are as my brothers, and if they have a secret----" And
then she blushed, grew confused, and paused.These signs were poisoned food indeed to Carew, but he did not betray
himself."It was wrong of me to speak," said Lauretta, "after my promise to say
nothing to a single soul in the village.""And most especially," said Carew, hitting the mark, "to me.""Only," he continued, with slight persistence, "that it must be a
heart secret."She was silent, and he dropped the subject.From the interchange of these few words he extracted the most
exquisite torture.There was, then, between Lauretta and the brothers
a secret of the heart, known only to themselves, to be revealed to
none, and to him, Gabriel Carew, to whom the young girl was affianced,
least of all.It must be well understood, in this explanation of what
was occurring in the lives of these young people at that momentous
period, that Gabriel Carew never once suspected that Lauretta was
false to him.His great fear was that Eric and Emilius were working
warily against him, and were cunningly fabricating some kind of
evidence in his disfavour which would rob him of Lauretta's love.They
were conspiring to this end, to the destruction of his happiness, and
they were waiting for the hour to strike the fatal blow.Well, it was
for him to strike first.His love for Lauretta was so all-absorbing
that all other considerations--however serious the direct or indirect
consequences of them--sank into utter insignificance by the side of
it.He did not allow it to weigh against Lauretta that she appeared to
be in collusion with Eric and Emilius, and to be favouring their
schemes.Her nature was so guileless and unsuspecting that she could
be easily led and deceived by friends in whom she placed a trust.It
was this that strengthened Carew in his resolve not to rudely make the
attempt to open her eyes to the perfidy of Eric and Emilius.She would
have been incredulous, and the arguments he should use against his
enemies might be turned against himself.Therefore he adhered to the
line of action he had marked out.He waited, and watched, and
suffered.Meanwhile, the day appointed for his union with Lauretta was
approaching.Within a fortnight of that day Gabriel Carew's passions were roused to
an almost uncontrollable pitch.It was evening, and he saw Eric and Emilius in the woods.They were
conversing with more than ordinary animation, and appeared to be
discussing some question upon which they did not agree.Carew saw
signs which he could not interpret--appeals, implorings, evidences of
strong feeling on one side and of humbleness on the other, despair
from one, sorrow from the other; and then suddenly a phase which
startled the watcher and filled him with a savage joy.Eric, in a
paroxysm, laid hands furiously upon his brother, and it seemed for a
moment as if a violent struggle were about to take place.It was to the restraint and moderation of Emilius that this
unbrotherly conflict was avoided.He did not meet violence with
violence; after a pause he gently lifted Eric's hands from his
shoulders, and with a sad look turned away, Eric gazing at his
retreating figure in a kind of bewilderment.Presently Emilius was
gone, and only Eric remained.From an opposite direction to that taken by
Emilius the watcher saw approaching the form of the woman he loved,
and to whom he was shortly to be wed.That her coming was not
accidental, but in fulfilment of a promise was clear to Gabriel Carew.Eric expected her, and welcomed her without surprise.Then the two
began to converse.Carew's heart beat tumultuously; he would have given worlds to hear
what was being said, but he was at too great a distance for a word to
reach his ears.For a time Eric was the principal speaker, Lauretta,
for the most part, listening, and uttering now and then merely a word
or two.In her quiet way she appeared to be as deeply agitated as the
young man who was addressing her in an attitude of despairing appeal.Again and again it seemed as if he had finished what he had to say,
and again and again he resumed, without abatement of the excitement
under which he was labouring.At length he ceased, and then Lauretta
became the principal actor in the scene.She spoke long and forcibly,
but always with that gentleness of manner which was one of her
sweetest characteristics.In her turn she seemed to be appealing to
the young man, and to be endeavouring to impress upon him a sad and
bitter truth which he was unwilling, and not in the mood, to
recognise.For a long time she was unsuccessful; the young man walked
impatiently a few steps from her, then returned, contrite and humble,
but still with all the signs of great suffering upon him.At length
her words had upon him the effect she desired; he wavered, he held out
his hands helplessly, and presently covered his face with them and
sank to the ground.Then, after a silence, during which Lauretta gazed
compassionately upon his convulsed form, she stooped and placed her
hand upon his shoulder.He lifted his eyes, from which the tears were
flowing, and raised himself from the earth.He stood before her with
bowed head, and she continued to speak.The pitiful sweetness of her
face almost drove Carew mad; it could not be mistaken that her heart
was beating with sympathy for Eric's sufferings.A few minutes more
passed, and then it seemed as if she had prevailed.Eric accepted the
hand she held out to him, and pressed his lips upon it.Had he at that
moment been within Gabriel Carew's reach, it would have fared ill with
both these men, but Heaven alone knows whether it would have averted
what was to follow before the setting of another sun, to the
consternation and grief of the entire village.After pressing his lips
to Lauretta's hand, the pair separated, each going a different way,
and Gabriel Carew ground his teeth as he observed that there were
tears in Lauretta's eyes as well as in Eric's.A darkness fell upon
him as he walked homewards.V.


The following morning Nerac and the neighbourhood around were agitated
by news of a tragedy more thrilling and terrible than that in which
the hunchback and his companion in crime were concerned.In attendance
upon this tragedy, and preceding its discovery, was a circumstance
stirring enough in its way in the usually quiet life of the simple
villagers, but which, in the light of the mysterious tragedy, would
have paled into insignificance had it not been that it appeared to
have a direct bearing upon it.Martin Hartog's daughter, Patricia, had
fled from her home, and was nowhere to be discovered.This flight was made known to the villagers early in the morning by
the appearance among them of Martin Hartog, demanding in which house
his daughter had taken refuge.The man was distracted; his wild words
and actions excited great alarm, and when he found that he could
obtain no satisfaction from them, and that every man and woman in
Nerac professed ignorance of his daughter's movements, he called down
heaven's vengeance upon the man who had betrayed her, and left them to
search the woods for Patricia.The words he had uttered in his imprecations when he called upon a
higher power for vengeance on a villain opened the villagers' eyes.Who was the monster who had
worked this evil?While they were talking excitedly together they saw Gabriel Carew
hurrying to the house of Father Daniel.He was admitted, and in the
course of a few minutes emerged from it in the company of the good
priest, whose troubled face denoted that he had heard the sad news of
Patricia's flight from her father's home.The villagers held aloof
from Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew, seeing that they were in earnest
converse.Carew was imparting to the priest his suspicions of Eric and
Emilius in connection with this event; he did not mention Lauretta's
name, but related how on several occasions he had been an accidental
witness of meetings between Patricia and one or other of the brothers."It was not for me to place a construction upon these meetings," said
Carew, "nor did it appear to me that I was called upon to mention it
to any one.It would have been natural for me to suppose that Martin
Hartog was fully acquainted with his daughter's movements, and that,
being of an independent nature, he would have resented any
interference from me.He is Patricia's father, and it was believed by
all that he guarded her well.Had he been my equal I might have
incidentally asked whether there was anything serious between his
daughter and these brothers, but I am his master, and therefore was
precluded from inviting a confidence which can only exist between men
occupying the same social condition.There is, besides, another reason
for my silence which, if you care to hear, I will impart to you.""Nothing should be concealed from me," said Father Daniel."Although," said Gabriel Carew, "I have been a resident here now for
some time, I felt, and feel, that a larger knowledge of me is
necessary to give due and just weight to the unfavourable opinion I
have formed of two men with whom you have been acquainted from
childhood, and who hold a place in your heart of which they are
utterly unworthy.Not alone in your heart, but in the hearts of my
dearest friends, Doctor Louis and his family."You refer to Eric and Emilius," said the priest."What you have already said concerning them has deeply pained me.Their meetings with Hartog's daughter were,
I am convinced, innocent.They are incapable of an act of baseness;
they are of noble natures, and it is impossible that they should ever
have harboured a thought of treachery to a young maiden.""I am more than justified," said Gabriel Carew, "by the expression of
your opinion, in the course I took.You would have listened with
impatience to me, and what I should have said would have recoiled on
myself.Yet now I regret that I did not interfere; this calamity might
have been avoided, and a woman's honour saved.Let us seek Martin
Hartog; he may be in possession of information to guide us."From the villagers they learnt that Hartog had gone to the woods, and
they were about to proceed in that direction when another, who had
just arrived, informed them that he had seen Hartog going to Gabriel
Carew's house.Thither they proceeded, and found Hartog in his
cottage.He was on his knees, when they entered, before a box in which
his daughter kept her clothes.This he had forced open, and was
searching.He looked wildly at Father Daniel and Carew, and
immediately resumed his task, throwing the girl's clothes upon the
floor after examining the pockets.In his haste and agitation he did
not observe a portrait which he had cast aside, Carew picked it up and
handed it to Father Daniel."Who is the more
likely to be right in our estimate of these brothers, you or I?"Father Daniel, overwhelmed by the evidence, did not reply.By this
time Martin Hartog had found a letter which he was eagerly perusing."If there is justice in heaven he has
met with his deserts.If he still lives he shall die by my hands!""Vengeance is not yours to deal
out.Pray for comfort--pray for mercy."If the monster be not already smitten, Lord, give him into
my hands!The
cunning villain has not even signed his name!"Father Daniel took the letter from his unresisting hand, and as his
eyes fell upon the writing he started and trembled.It was indeed the writing of Emilius.Martin Hartog had heard Carew's
inquiry and the priest's reply.And without another word he rushed
from the cottage.Carew and the priest hastily followed him, but he
outstripped them, and was soon out of sight."There will be a deed of violence done," said Father Daniel, "if the
men meet.I must go immediately to the house of these unhappy brothers
and warn them."Carew accompanied him, but when they arrived at the house they were
informed that nothing had been seen of Eric and Emilius since the
previous night.Neither of them had been home nor slept in his bed.This seemed to complicate the mystery in Father Daniel's eyes,
although it was no mystery to Carew, who was convinced that where
Patricia was there would Emilius be found.Father Daniel's grief and
horror were clearly depicted.He looked upon the inhabitants of Nerac
as one family, and he regarded the dishonour of Martin Hartog's
daughter as dishonour to all.Carew, being anxious to see Lauretta,
left him to his inquiries.Louis and his family were already
acquainted with the agitating news."Dark clouds hang over this once happy village," said Doctor Louis to
Carew.He was greatly shocked, but he had no hesitation in declaring that,
although circumstances looked black against the twin brothers, his
faith in them was undisturbed.Lauretta shared his belief, and
Lauretta's mother also.Gabriel Carew did not combat with them; he
held quietly to his views, convinced that in a short time they would
think as he did.Lauretta was very pale, and out of consideration for
her Gabriel Carew endeavoured to avoid the all-engrossing subject.Nothing else could be thought or spoken
of.Once Carew remarked
to Lauretta, "You said that Eric and Emilius had a secret, and you
gave me to understand that you were not ignorant of it.Has it any
connection with what has occurred?""I must not answer you, Gabriel," she replied; "when we see Emilius
again all will be explained."Little did she suspect the awful import of those simple words.In
Carew's mind the remembrance of the story of Kristel and Silvain was
very vivid."Were Eric and Emilius true friends?"Lauretta looked at him piteously; her lips quivered."They are
brothers," she said.She gazed at him in tender surprise; for weeks past he had not been so
happy.The trouble by which he had been haunted took flight."And yet," he could not help saying, "you have a secret, and you keep
it from me!"His voice was almost gay; there was no touch of reproach in it."The secret is not mine, Gabriel," she said, and she allowed him to
pass his arm around her; her head sank upon his breast."When you know
all, you will approve," she murmured."As I trust you, so must you
trust me."Their lips met; perfect confidence and faith were established between
them, although on Lauretta's side there had been no shadow on the love
she gave him.It was late in the afternoon when Carew was informed that Father
Daniel wished to speak to him privately.He kissed Lauretta and went
out to the priest, in whose face he saw a new horror."I should be the first to tell them," said Father Daniel in a husky
voice, "but I am not yet strong enough."No," replied the priest, "but Eric is.I would not have him removed
until the magistrate, who is absent and has been sent for, arrives.In a state of wonder Carew accompanied Father Daniel out of Doctor
Louis's house, and the priest led the way to the woods."We have passed the
house in which the brothers live."The sun was setting, and the light was quivering on the tops of the
distant trees.Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew plunged into the woods.There were scouts on the outskirts, to whom the priest said, "Has the
magistrate arrived?""No, father," was the answer, "we expect him every moment."From that moment until they arrived at the spot to which Father Daniel
led him, Carew was silent.What had passed between him and Lauretta
had so filled his soul with happiness that he bestowed but little
thought upon a vulgar intrigue between a peasant girl and men whom he
had long since condemned.They no longer troubled him; they had passed
for ever out of his life, and his heart was at rest.Father Daniel and
he walked some distance into the shadows of the forest and the night.Before him he saw lights in the hands of two villagers who had
evidently been stationed there to keep guard."Yes," he replied, "it is I."He conducted Gabriel Carew to a spot, and pointed downwards with his
finger; and there, prone and still upon the fallen leaves, lay the
body of Eric stone dead, stabbed to the heart!"Martin Hartog," said the priest, "is in custody on suspicion of this
ruthless murder.""What evidence is there to incriminate
him?""When the body was first discovered," said the priest, "your gardener
was standing by its side.Upon being questioned his answer was, 'If
judgment has not fallen upon the monster, it has overtaken his
brother.The brood should be wiped off the face of the earth.'Gabriel Carew was overwhelmed by the horror of this discovery.The
meeting between the brothers, of which he had been a secret witness on
the previous evening, and during which Eric had laid violent hands on
Emilius, recurred to him.He had not spoken of it, nor did he mention
it now.If Martin Hartog confessed his guilt
the matter was settled; if he did not, the criminal must be sought
elsewhere, and it would be his duty to supply evidence which would
tend to fix the crime upon Emilius.He did not believe Martin Hartog
to be guilty; he had already decided within himself that Emilius had
murdered Eric, and that the tragedy of Kristel and Silvain had been
repeated in the lives of Silvain's sons.There was a kind of
retribution in this which struck Gabriel Carew with singular force."Useless," he thought, "to fly from a fate which is preordained.When
he recovered from the horror which had fallen on him upon beholding
the body of Eric, he asked Father Daniel at what hour of the day the
unhappy man had been killed."That," said Father Daniel, "has yet to be determined.No doctor has
seen the body, but the presumption is that when Martin Hartog,
animated by his burning craving for vengeance, of which we were both a
witness, rushed from his cottage, he made his way to the woods, and
that he here unhappily met the brother of the man whom he believed to
be the betrayer of his daughter.The arrival of the magistrate put a stop to the conversation.He
listened to what Father Daniel had to relate, and some portions of the
priest's explanations were corroborated by Gabriel Carew.The
magistrate then gave directions that the body of Eric should be
conveyed to the courthouse; and he and the priest and Carew walked
back to the village together."The village will become notorious," he remarked."Is there an
epidemic of murder amongst us that this one should follow so closely
upon the heels of the other?"Then, after a pause, he asked Father
Daniel whether he believed Martin Hartog to be guilty."I believe no man to be guilty," said the priest, "until he is proved
so incontrovertibly."I bear in remembrance," said the magistrate, "that you would not
subscribe to the general belief in the hunchback's guilt.""Nor do I now," said Father Daniel."And you," said the magistrate, turning to Gabriel Carew, "do you
believe Hartog to be guilty?""This is not the time or place," said Carew, "for me to give
expression to any suspicion I may entertain.The first thing to be
settled is Hartog's complicity in this murder.""Father Daniel believes," continued Carew, "that Eric was murdered
to-day, within the last hour or two."The doctors will decide that," said the magistrate."If the deed was
not, in your opinion, perpetrated within the last few hours, when do
you suppose it was done?""Have you any distinct grounds for the belief?"You have asked me a question which I have answered.There is no
matter of absolute knowledge involved in it; if there were I should be
able to speak more definitely.Until the doctors pronounce there is
nothing more to be said.But I may say this: if Hartog is proved to be
innocent, I may have something to reveal in the interests of justice."The magistrate nodded and said, "By the way, where is Emilius, and
what has he to say about it?""Neither Eric nor Emilius," replied Father Daniel, "slept at home last
night, and since yesterday evening Emilius has not been seen.""Nothing is known of him," said Father Daniel."Inquiries have been
made, but nothing satisfactory has been elicited."The magistrate glanced at Carew, and for a little while was silent.Shortly after they reached the court-house the doctors presented their
report.In their opinion Eric had been dead at least fourteen or
fifteen hours, certainly for longer than twelve.This disposed of the
theory that he had been killed in the afternoon.Their belief was that
the crime was committed shortly after midnight.In that case Martin
Hartog must be incontestably innocent.He was able to account for
every hour of the previous day and night.He was out until near
midnight; he was accompanied home, and a friend sat up with him till
late, both keeping very quiet for fear of disturbing Patricia, who was
supposed to be asleep in her room, but who before that time had most
likely fled from her home.Moreover, it was proved that Martin Hartog
rose in the morning at a certain time, and that it was only then that
he became acquainted with the disappearance of his daughter.Father
Daniel and Gabriel Carew were present when the magistrate questioned
Hartog.The man seemed indifferent as to his fate, but he answered
quite clearly the questions put to him.He had not left his cottage
after going to bed on the previous night; he believed his daughter to
be in her room, and only this morning discovered his mistake.After
his interview with Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew he rushed from the
cottage in the hope of meeting with Emilius, whom he intended to kill;
he came upon the dead body of Eric in the woods, and his only regret
was that it was Eric and not Emilius."If the villain who has dishonoured me were here at this moment," said
Martin Hartog, "I would strangle him.No power should save him from my
just revenge!"The magistrate ordered him to be set at liberty, and he wandered out
of the court-house a hopeless and despairing man.Then the magistrate
turned to Carew, and asked him, now that Hartog was proved to be
innocent, what he had to reveal that might throw light upon the crime.Carew, after some hesitation, related what he had seen the night
before when Emilius and Eric were together in the forest."But," said the magistrate, "the brothers were known to be on the most
loving terms.""So," said Carew, "were their father, Silvain, and his brother Kristel
until a woman stepped between them.Upon this matter, however, it is
not for me to speak."I have heard something of the story of these hapless brothers," said
the magistrate, pondering, "but am not acquainted with all the
particulars.Carew then asked that he should be allowed to go for Doctor Louis, his
object being to explain to the doctor, on their way to the magistrate,
how it was that reference had been made to the story of Silvain and
Kristel which he had heard from the doctor's lips.He also desired to
hint to Doctor Louis that Lauretta might be in possession of
information respecting Eric and Emilius which might be useful in
clearing up the mystery."You have acted right," said Doctor Louis sadly to Gabriel Carew; "at
all risks justice must be done.And
is this to be the end of that fated family?I cannot believe that
Emilius can be guilty of a crime so horrible!"His distress was so keen that Carew himself, now that he was freed
from the jealousy by which he had been tortured with respect to
Lauretta, hoped also that Emilius would be able to clear himself of
the charge hanging over him.But when they arrived at the magistrate's
court they were confronted by additional evidence which seemed to tell
heavily against the absent brother.A witness had come forward who
deposed that, being out on the previous night very late, and taking a
short cut through the woods to his cottage, he heard voices of two men
which he recognised as the voices of Emilius and Eric.They were
raised in anger, and one--the witness could not say which--cried out,

"Well, kill me, for I do not wish to live!"Upon being asked why he did not interpose, his answer was that he did
not care to mix himself up with a desperate quarrel; and that as he
had a family he thought the best thing he could do was to hasten home
as quickly as possible.Having told all he knew he was dismissed, and
bade to hold himself in readiness to repeat his evidence on a future
occasion.Then the magistrate heard what Doctor Louis had to say, and summed up
the whole matter thus:

"The reasonable presumption is, that the brothers quarrelled over some
love affair with a person at present unknown; for although Martin
Hartog's daughter has disappeared, there is nothing as yet to connect
her directly with the affair.Whether premeditatedly, or in a fit of
ungovernable passion, Emilius killed his brother and fled.If he does
not present himself to-morrow morning in the village he must be sought
for.It was a melancholy night for all, to Carew in a lesser degree than to
the others, for the crime which had thrown gloom over the whole
village had brought ease to his heart.He saw now how unreasonable had
been his jealousy of the brothers, and he was disposed to judge them
more leniently.On that night Doctor Louis held a private conference with Lauretta,
and received from her an account of the unhappy difference between the
brothers.As Silvain and Kristel had both loved one woman, so had Eric
and Emilius, but in the case of the sons there had been no supplanting
of the affections.Emilius and Patricia had long loved each other, and
had kept their love a secret, Eric himself not knowing it.When
Emilius discovered that his brother loved Patricia his distress of
mind was very great, and it was increased by the knowledge that was
forced upon him that there was in Eric's passion for the girl
something of the fierce quality which had distinguished Kristel's
passion for Avicia.In his distress he had sought advice from
Lauretta, and she had undertaken to act as an intermediary, and to
endeavour to bring Eric to reason.On two or three occasions she
thought she had succeeded, but her influence over Eric lasted only as
long as he was in her presence.He made promises which he found it
impossible to keep, and he continued to hope against hope.Lauretta
did not know what had passed between the brothers on the previous
evening, in the interview of which I was a witness, but earlier in the
day she had seen Emilius, who had confided a secret to her keeping
which placed Eric's love for Patricia beyond the pale of hope.He was
secretly married to Patricia, and had been so for some time.When
Gabriel Carew heard this he recognised how unjust he had been towards
Emilius and Patricia in the construction he had placed upon their
secret interviews.Lauretta advised Emilius to make known his marriage
to Eric, and offered to reveal the fact to the despairing lover, but
Emilius would not consent to this being immediately done.He
stipulated that a week should pass before the revelation was made;
then, he said, it might be as well that all the world should know
it--a fatal stipulation, against which Lauretta argued in vain.Thus
it was that in the last interview between Eric and Lauretta, Eric was
still in ignorance of the insurmountable bar to his hopes.As it
subsequently transpired, Emilius had made preparations to remove
Patricia from Nerac that very night.Up to that point, and at that
time nothing more was known; but when Emilius was tried for the murder
Lauretta's evidence did not help to clear him, because it established
beyond doubt the fact of the existence of an animosity between the
brothers.On the day following the discovery of the murder, Emilius did not make
his appearance in the village, and officers were sent in search of
him.There was no clue as to the direction which he and Patricia had
taken, and the officers, being slow-witted, were many days before they
succeeded in finding him.Their statement, upon their return to Nerac
with their prisoner, was, that upon informing him of the charge
against him, he became violently agitated and endeavoured to escape.He denied that he made such an attempt, asserting that he was
naturally agitated by the awful news, and that for a few minutes he
scarcely knew what he was doing, but, being innocent, there was no
reason why he should make a fruitless endeavour to avoid an inevitable
inquiry into the circumstances of a most dreadful crime.No brother, he declared, had
ever been more fondly loved than Eric was by him, and he would have
suffered a voluntary death rather than be guilty of an act of violence
towards one for whom he entertained so profound an affection.In the
preliminary investigations he gave the following explanation of all
within his knowledge.What Lauretta had stated was true in every
particular; neither did he deny Carew's evidence nor the evidence of
the villager who had deposed that, late on the night of the murder,
high words had passed between him and Eric."The words," said Emilius, "'Well, kill me, for I do not wish to
live!'were uttered by my poor brother when I told him that Patricia
was my wife.For although I had not intended that this should be known
until a few days after my departure, my poor brother was so worked up
by his love for my wife, that I felt I dared not, in justice to him
and myself, leave him any longer in ignorance.For that reason, and
thus impelled, pitying him most deeply, I revealed to him the truth.Had the witness whose evidence, true as it is, seems to bear fatally
against me, waited and listened, he would have been able to testify in
my favour.My poor brother for a time was overwhelmed by the
revelation.His love for my wife perhaps did not die immediately away;
but, high-minded and honourable as he was, he recognised that to
persevere in it would be a guilty act.The force of his passion became
less; he was no longer violent--he was mournful.He even, in a
despairing way, begged my forgiveness, and I, reproachful that I had
not earlier confided in him, begged _his_ forgiveness for the
unconscious wrong I had done him.Then, after a while, we fell
into our old ways of love; tender words were exchanged; we clasped
each other's hand; we embraced.Truly you who hear me can scarcely
realise what Eric and I had always been to each other.More than
brothers--more like lovers.Heartbroken as he was at the conviction
that the woman he adored was lost to him, I was scarcely less
heartbroken that I had won her.And so, after an hour's loving
converse, I left him; and when we parted, with a promise to meet again
when his wound was healed, we kissed each other as we had done in the
days of our childhood."RICHARD CLAY AND SONS, LONDON AND BUNGAY.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Secret Inheritance  (Volume 2 of 3), by
B. L.When the soft, low call or the wood-doves, those spirits of the
summer, came out of the distance, she would incline her head and
listen, the whole spiritual quality of it dropping like silver bubbles
into her own great heart.Where the sunlight was warm and the shadows flecked with its
splendid radiance she delighted to wonder at the pattern of it, to
walk where it was most golden, and follow with instinctive
appreciation the holy corridors of the trees.That wonderful radiance which fills
the western sky at evening touched and unburdened her heart."I wonder," she said once with girlish simplicity, "how it would
feel to float away off there among those clouds."She had discovered a natural swing of a wild grape-vine, and was
sitting in it with Martha and George."Oh, wouldn't it be nice if you had a boat up there," said
George.She was looking with uplifted face at a far-off cloud, a red island
in a sea of silver."Just supposing," she said, "people could live on an island like
that."Her soul was already up there, and its elysian paths knew the
lightness of her feet."There goes a bee," said George, noting a bumbler winging by."Yes," she said, dreamily, "it's going home.""Yes," she said, deeply feeling the poetry of it herself, "the
birds go home."said George, who saw one traveling
lonesomely along the nearby road."Why, of course," she said, "you know that dogs go home."he persisted, seeing one of those curious spirals
of minute insects turning energetically in the waning light."Yes," she said, half believing her remark."Oho," exclaimed George, incredulously, "I wonder what kind of
houses they live in."she gently persisted, putting out her hand to still
him.It was that halcyon hour when the Angelus falls like a benediction
upon the waning day.Far off the notes were sounding gently, and
nature, now that she listened, seemed to have paused also.A
scarlet-breasted robin was hopping in short spaces upon the grass
before her.A humming bee hummed, a cow-bell tinkled, while some
suspicious cracklings told of a secretly reconnoitering squirrel.Keeping her pretty hand weighed in the air, she listened until the
long, soft notes spread and faded and her heart could hold no more."Oh," she said, clenching her fingers in an agony of poetic
feeling.The
wondrous sea of feeling in her had stormed its banks.Of such was the
spirit of Jennie.CHAPTER III


The junior Senator, George Sylvester Brander, was a man of peculiar
mold.In him there were joined, to a remarkable degree, the wisdom of
the opportunist and the sympathetic nature of the true representative
of the people.Born a native of southern Ohio, he had been raised and
educated there, if one might except the two years in which he had
studied law at Columbia University.He knew common and criminal law,
perhaps, as well as any citizen of his State, but he had never
practised with that assiduity which makes for pre-eminent success at
the bar.He had made money, and had had splendid opportunities to make
a great deal more if he had been willing to stultify his conscience,
but that he had never been able to do.And yet his integrity had not
been at all times proof against the claims of friendship.Only in the
last presidential election he had thrown his support to a man for
Governor who, he well knew, had no claim which a strictly honorable
conscience could have recognized.In the same way, he had been guilty of some very questionable, and
one or two actually unsavory, appointments.Whenever his conscience
pricked him too keenly he would endeavor to hearten himself with his
pet phrase, "All in a lifetime."Thinking over things quite alone in
his easy-chair, he would sometimes rise up with these words on his
lips, and smile sheepishly as he did so.Conscience was not by any
means dead in him.His sympathies, if anything, were keener than
ever.This man, three times Congressman from the district of which
Columbus was a part, and twice United States Senator, had never
married.In his youth he had had a serious love affair, but there was
nothing discreditable to him in the fact that it came to nothing.The
lady found it inconvenient to wait for him.He was too long in earning
a competence upon which they might subsist.Tall, straight-shouldered, neither lean nor stout, he was to-day an
imposing figure.Having received his hard knocks and endured his
losses, there was that about him which touched and awakened the
sympathies of the imaginative.People thought him naturally agreeable,
and his senatorial peers looked upon him as not any too heavy
mentally, but personally a fine man.His presence in Columbus at this particular time was due to the
fact that his political fences needed careful repairing.The general
election had weakened his party in the State Legislature.There were
enough votes to re-elect him, but it would require the most careful
political manipulation to hold them together.There were a half-dozen available candidates, any one of
whom would have rejoiced to step into his shoes.He realized the
exigencies of the occasion.They could not well beat him, he thought;
but even if this should happen, surely the President could be induced
to give him a ministry abroad.Yes, he might be called a successful man, but for all that Senator
Brander felt that he had missed something.He had wanted to do so many
things.Here he was, fifty-two years of age, clean, honorable, highly
distinguished, as the world takes it, but single.He could not help
looking about him now and then and speculating upon the fact that he
had no one to care for him.His chamber seemed strangely hollow at
times--his own personality exceedingly disagreeable.Sitting in his chamber that Saturday afternoon, a rap at his door
aroused him.He had been speculating upon the futility of his
political energy in the light of the impermanence of life and
fame."What a great fight we make to sustain ourselves!""How
little difference it will make to me a few years hence!"He arose, and opening wide his door, perceived Jennie.She had
come, as she had suggested to her mother, at this time, instead of on
Monday, in order to give a more favorable impression of
promptness."Come right in," said the Senator; and, as on the first occasion,
he graciously made way for her.Jennie passed in, momentarily expecting some compliment upon the
promptitude with which the washing had been done."Well, my young lady," he said when she had put the bundle down,
"how do you find yourself this evening?""We thought we'd better bring your
clothes to-day instead of Monday.""Oh, that would not have made any difference," replied Brander
lightly.Jennie, without considering the fact that she had been offered no
payment for the service rendered, was about to retire, had not the
Senator detained her."She's very well," said Jennie simply.Moving to a near-by chair, the young girl seated herself.he went on, clearing his throat lightly, "What seems to be
the matter with her?""She has the measles," returned Jennie."We thought once that she
was going to die."Brander studied her face as she said this, and he thought he saw
something exceedingly pathetic there.The girl's poor clothes and her
wondering admiration for his exalted station in life affected him.It
made him feel almost ashamed of the comfort and luxury that surrounded
him.How high up he was in the world, indeed!"I am glad she is better now," he said kindly."Oh yes, sir; he's around now, although he can't go out just
yet.""I believe your mother said he was a glass-blower by trade?"Brander well knew the depressed local conditions in this branch of
manufacture.It had been part of the political issue in the last
campaign."Do all of the children go to school?""Why yes, sir," returned Jennie, stammering.She was too shamefaced
to own that one of the children had been obliged to leave school for
the lack of shoes.He reflected awhile; then realizing that he had no good excuse for
further detaining her, he arose and came over to her.From his pocket
he took a thin layer of bills, and removing one, handed it to her."You take that," he said, "and tell your mother that I said she
should use it for whatever she wants."Jennie accepted the money with mingled feelings; it did not occur
to her to look and see how much it was.The great man was so near her,
the wonderful chamber in which he dwelt so impressive, that she
scarcely realized what she was doing."Is there any day you want your washing
called for?""Oh yes," he answered; "Monday--Monday evenings."She went away, and in a half reverie he closed the door behind her.The interest that he felt in these people was unusual.Poverty and
beauty certainly made up an affecting combination.He sat down in his
chair and gave himself over to the pleasant speculations which her
coming had aroused."I'll find out where they live," he finally resolved.In the days that followed Jennie regularly came for the clothes.Senator Brander found himself more and more interested in her, and in
time he managed to remove from her mind that timidity and fear which
had made her feel uncomfortable in his presence.One thing which
helped toward this was his calling her by her first name.This began
with her third visit, and thereafter he used it with almost
unconscious frequency.It could scarcely be said that he did this in a fatherly spirit,
for he had little of that attitude toward any one.He felt exceedingly
young as he talked to this girl, and he often wondered whether it were
not possible for her to perceive and appreciate him on his youthful
side.As for Jennie, she was immensely taken with the comfort and luxury
surrounding this man, and subconsciously with the man himself, the
most attractive she had ever known.Everything he had was fine,
everything he did was gentle, distinguished, and considerate.From
some far source, perhaps some old German ancestors, she had inherited
an understanding and appreciation of all this.Life ought to be lived
as he lived it; the privilege of being generous particularly appealed
to her.Part of her attitude was due to that of her mother, in whose mind
sympathy was always a more potent factor than reason.For instance,
when she brought to her the ten dollars Mrs."Oh," said Jennie, "I didn't know until I got outside that it was
so much.Gerhardt took it, and holding it loosely in her folded hands,
saw distinctly before her the tall Senator with his fine manners.Frequently throughout the evening and the next day Mrs.Gerhardt
commented upon this wonderful treasure-trove, repeating again and
again how good he must be or how large must be his heart.When it came
to washing his clothes she almost rubbed them to pieces, feeling that
whatever she did she could scarcely do enough.He had such stern views about accepting money without earning it
that even in their distress, she would have experienced some
difficulty in getting him to take it.Consequently she said nothing,
but used it to buy bread and meat, and going as it did such a little
way, the sudden windfall was never noticed.Jennie, from now on, reflected this attitude toward the Senator,
and, feeling so grateful toward him, she began to talk more freely.They came to be on such good terms that he gave her a little leather
picture-case from his dresser which he had observed her admiring.Every time she came he found excuse to detain her, and soon discovered
that, for all her soft girlishness, there lay deep-seated in her a
conscious deprecation of poverty and a shame of having to own any
need.He honestly admired her for this, and, seeing that her clothes
were poor and her shoes worn, he began to wonder how he could help her
without offending.Not infrequently he thought to follow her some evening, and see for
himself what the condition of the family might be.He was a United
States Senator, however.The neighborhood they lived in must be very
poor.He stopped to consider, and for the time the counsels of
prudence prevailed.Consequently the contemplated visit was put
off.Early in December Senator Brander returned to Washington for three
weeks, and both Mrs.Gerhardt and Jennie were surprised to learn one
day that he had gone.Never had he given them less than two dollars a
week for his washing, and several times it had been five.He had not
realized, perhaps, what a breach his absence would make in their
finances.But there was nothing to do about it; they managed to pinch
along.Gerhardt, now better, searched for work at the various mills,
and finding nothing, procured a saw-buck and saw, and going from door
to door, sought for the privilege of sawing wood.There was not a
great deal of this to do, but he managed, by the most earnest labor to
earn two, and sometimes three, dollars a week.This added to what his
wife earned and what Sebastian gave was enough to keep bread in their
mouths, but scarcely more.It was at the opening of the joyous Christmas-time that the
bitterness of their poverty affected them most.The Germans love to
make a great display at Christmas.It is the one season of the year
when the fullness of their large family affection manifests itself.Warm in the appreciation of the joys of childhood, they love to see
the little ones enjoy their toys and games.Father Gerhardt at his
saw-buck during the weeks before Christmas thought of this very often.What would little Veronica not deserve after her long illness!How he
would have liked to give each of the children a stout pair of shoes,
the boys a warm cap, the girls a pretty hood.Toys and games and candy
they always had had before.He hated to think of the snow-covered
Christmas morning and no table richly piled with what their young
hearts would most desire.Gerhardt, one could better imagine than describe her
feelings.She felt so keenly about it that she could hardly bring
herself to speak of the dreaded hour to her husband.She had managed
to lay aside three dollars in the hope of getting enough to buy a ton
of coal, and so put an end to poor George's daily pilgrimage to the
coal yard, but now as the Christmas week drew near she decided to use
it for gifts.Father Gerhardt was also secreting two dollars without
the knowledge of his wife, thinking that on Christmas Eve he could
produce it at a critical moment, and so relieve her maternal
anxiety.When the actual time arrived, however, there was very little to be
said for the comfort that they got out of the occasion.The whole city
was rife with Christmas atmosphere.Grocery stores and meat markets
were strung with holly.The toy shops and candy stores were radiant
with fine displays of everything that a self-respecting Santa Claus
should have about him.Both parents and children observed it
all--the former with serious thoughts of need and anxiety, the
latter with wild fancy and only partially suppressed longings.Frequently had Gerhardt said in their presence:

"Kriss Kringle is very poor this year.He hasn't so very much to
give."But no child, however poverty-stricken, could be made to believe
this.Every time after so saying he looked into their eyes, but in
spite of the warning, expectation flamed in them undiminished.Christmas coming on Tuesday, the Monday before there was no school.Gerhardt had cautioned George that he
must bring enough coal from the yards to last over Christmas day.The
latter went at once with his two younger sisters, but there being a
dearth of good picking, it took them a long time to fill their
baskets, and by night they had gathered only a scanty supply.Gerhardt the first thing when
she returned from the hotel that evening."Did you get enough for to-morrow?""Yes," he replied, "I guess so.""Well, now, I'll go and look," she replied.Taking the lamp, they
went out into the woodshed where the coal was deposited.she exclaimed when she saw it; "why, that isn't near
enough.You must go right off and get some more.""Oh," said George, pouting his lips, "I don't want to go.Bass, who had returned promptly at a quarter-past six, was already
busy in the back bedroom washing and dressing preparatory to going
down-town."I don't want to," pouted George.Gerhardt, "maybe to-morrow you'll be without
a fire, and then what?"They went back to the house, but George's conscience was too
troubled to allow him to consider the case as closed."Bass, you come, too," he called to his elder brother when he was
inside."No," said the former, "I guess not."Well, then, I'll not," said George, with an obstinate jerk of his
head."Why didn't you get it up this afternoon?"questioned his brother
sharply; "you've had all day to do it.""Aw, I did try," said George.I can't get
any when there ain't any, can I?""I guess you didn't try very hard," said the dandy.asked Jennie, who, coming in after having
stopped at the grocer's for her mother, saw George with a solemn pout
on his face."Oh, Bass won't go with me to get any coal?""Didn't you get any this afternoon?""Yes," said George, "but ma says I didn't get enough.""I'll go with you," said his sister."Bass, will you come
along?""No," said the young man, indifferently, "I won't."He was
adjusting his necktie and felt irritated."There ain't any," said George, "unless we get it off the cars."Oh, don't quarrel," said Jennie."Get the baskets and let's go
right now before it gets too late."The other children, who had a fondness for their big sister, got
out the implements of supply--Veronica a basket, Martha and
William buckets, and George, a big clothes-basket, which he and Jennie
were to fill and carry between them.Bass, moved by his sister's
willingness and the little regard he still maintained for her, now
made a suggestion."I'll tell you what you do, Jen," he said."You go over there with
the kids to Eighth Street and wait around those cars.When I come by don't any of you pretend to know me.Just you
say, 'Mister, won't you please throw us some coal down?'and then I'll
get up on the cars and pitch off enough to fill the baskets."All right," said Jennie, very much pleased.Out into the snowy night they went, and made their way to the
railroad tracks.At the intersection of the street and the broad
railroad yard were many heavily laden cars of bituminous coal newly
backed in.All of the children gathered within the shadow of one.While they were standing there, waiting the arrival of their brother,
the Washington Special arrived, a long, fine train with several of the
new style drawing-room cars, the big plate-glass windows shining and
the passengers looking out from the depths of their comfortable
chairs.The children instinctively drew back as it thundered past."Wouldn't I like to be a brakeman, though," sighed William.Jennie, alone, kept silent, but to her particularly the suggestion
of travel and comfort had appealed.How beautiful life must be for the
rich!Sebastian now appeared in the distance, a mannish spring in his
stride, and with every evidence that he took himself seriously.He was
of that peculiar stubbornness and determination that had the children
failed to carry out his plan of procedure he would have gone
deliberately by and refused to help them at all.Martha, however, took the situation as it needed to be taken, and
piped out childishly, "Mister, won't you please throw us down some
coal?"Sebastian stopped abruptly, and looking sharply at them as though
he were really a stranger, exclaimed, "Why, certainly," and proceeded
to climb up on the car, from whence he cast down with remarkable
celerity more than enough chunks to fill their baskets.Then as though
not caring to linger any longer amid such plebeian company, he
hastened across the network of tracks and was lost to view.On their way home they encountered another gentleman, this time a
real one, with high hat and distinguished cape coat, whom Jennie
immediately recognized.This was the honorable Senator himself, newly
returned from Washington, and anticipating a very unprofitable
Christmas.He had arrived upon the express which had enlisted the
attention of the children, and was carrying his light grip for the
pleasure of it to the hotel.As he passed he thought that he
recognized Jennie.he said, and paused to be more certain.The latter, who had discovered him even more quickly than he had
her, exclaimed, "Oh, there is Mr.Then, dropping her end of
the basket, with a caution to the children to take it right home, she
hurried away in the opposite direction.The Senator followed, vainly calling three or four times "Jennie!Losing hope of overtaking her, and suddenly recognizing, and
thereupon respecting, her simple, girlish shame, he stopped, and
turning back, decided to follow the children.Again he felt that same
sensation which he seemed always to get from this girl--the far
cry between her estate and his.It was something to be a Senator
to-night, here where these children were picking coal.What could the
joyous holiday of the morrow hold for them?He tramped along
sympathetically, an honest lightness coming into his step, and soon he
saw them enter the gateway of the low cottage.Crossing the street, he
stood in the weak shade of the snow-laden trees.The light was burning
with a yellow glow in a rear window.In
the woodshed he could hear the voices of the children, and once he
thought he detected the form of Mrs.After a time another
form came shadow-like through the side gate.It
touched him to the quick, and he bit his lip sharply to suppress any
further show of emotion.Then he turned vigorously on his heel and
walked away.The chief grocery of the city was conducted by one Manning, a
stanch adherent of Brander, and one who felt honored by the Senator's
acquaintance.To him at his busy desk came the Senator this same
night."Manning," he said, "could I get you to undertake a little work for
me this evening?""Why, certainly, Senator, certainly," said the grocery-man."I want you to get everything together that would make a nice
Christmas for a family of eight--father and mother and six
children--Christmas tree, groceries, toys--you know what I
mean."I'll give you
the address," and he picked up a note-book to write it."Why, I'll be delighted, Senator," went on Mr."Here you are, Manning," said the Senator, grimly, from the mere
necessity of preserving his senatorial dignity."Send everything at
once, and the bill to me.""I'll be delighted," was all the astonished and approving
grocery-man could say.The Senator passed out, but remembering the old people, visited a
clothier and shoe man, and, finding that he could only guess at what
sizes might be required, ordered the several articles with the
privilege of exchange.When his labors were over, he returned to his
room."Carrying coal," he thought, over and over."Really, it was very
thoughtless in me.CHAPTER IV


The desire to flee which Jennie experienced upon seeing the Senator
again was attributable to what she considered the disgrace of her
position.She was ashamed to think that he, who thought so well of
her, should discover her doing so common a thing.Girl-like, she was
inclined to imagine that his interest in her depended upon something
else than her mere personality.Gerhardt had heard of her flight from
the other children."What was the matter with you, anyhow?"asked George, when she came
in."Oh, nothing," she answered, but immediately turned to her mother
and said, "Mr.What
made you run, though, you foolish girl?""Well, I didn't want him to see me.""Well, maybe he didn't know you, anyhow," she said, with a certain
sympathy for her daughter's predicament."Oh yes, he did, too," whispered Jennie."He called after me three
or four times."said Gerhardt, who had been hearing the conversation
from the adjoining room, and now came out."Oh, nothing," said the mother, who hated to explain the
significance which the Senator's personality had come to have in their
lives."A man frightened them when they were bringing the coal."The arrival of the Christmas presents later in the evening threw
the household into an uproar of excitement.Neither Gerhardt nor the
mother could believe their eyes when a grocery wagon halted in front
of their cottage and a lusty clerk began to carry in the gifts.After
failing to persuade the clerk that he had made a mistake, the large
assortment of good things was looked over with very human glee."Just you never mind," was the clerk's authoritative words.Gerhardt moved about, rubbing her hands in her excitement, and
giving vent to an occasional "Well, isn't that nice now!"Gerhardt himself was melted at the thought of the generosity of the
unknown benefactor, and was inclined to lay it all to the goodness of
a great local mill owner, who knew him and wished him well.Gerhardt tearfully suspected the source, but said nothing.Jennie
knew, by instinct, the author of it all.The afternoon of the day after Christmas Brander encountered the
mother in the hotel, Jennie having been left at home to look after the
house.Gerhardt," he exclaimed genially extending his
hand.Gerhardt took it nervously; her eyes filled rapidly with
tears."There, there," he said, patting her on the shoulder.You mustn't forget to get my laundry to-day.""Oh no, sir," she returned, and would have said more had he not
walked away.From this on, Gerhardt heard continually of the fine Senator at the
hotel, how pleasant he was, and how much he paid for his washing.With
the simplicity of a German workingman, he was easily persuaded that
Mr.Brander must be a very great and a very good man.Jennie, whose feelings needed no encouragement in this direction,
was more than ever prejudiced in his favor.There was developing in her that perfection of womanhood, the full
mold of form, which could not help but attract any man.Already she
was well built, and tall for a girl.Had she been dressed in the
trailing skirts of a woman of fashion she would have made a fitting
companion for a man the height of the Senator.Her eyes were
wondrously clear and bright, her skin fair, and her teeth white and
even.She was clever, too, in a sensible way, and by no means
deficient in observation.All that she lacked was training and the
assurance of which the knowledge of utter dependency despoils one.But
the carrying of washing and the compulsion to acknowledge almost
anything as a favor put her at a disadvantage.Nowadays when she came to the hotel upon her semi-weekly errand
Senator Brander took her presence with easy grace, and to this she
responded.He often gave her little presents for herself, or for her
brothers and sisters, and he talked to her so unaffectedly that
finally the overawing sense of the great difference between them was
brushed away, and she looked upon him more as a generous friend than
as a distinguished Senator.He asked her once how she would like to go
to a seminary, thinking all the while how attractive she would be when
she came out.Finally, one evening, he called her to his side."Come over here, Jennie," he said, "and stand by me."She came, and, moved by a sudden impulse, he took her hand."Well, Jennie," he said, studying her face in a quizzical,
interrogative way, "what do you think of me, anyhow?""Oh," she answered, looking consciously away, "I don't know."Oh yes, you do," he returned."No, I haven't," she said, innocently."Oh yes, you have," he went on, pleasantly, interested by her
transparent evasiveness.she asked, frankly, looking down at
the big mop of black hair well streaked with gray which hung about his
forehead, and gave an almost lionine cast to his fine face."Well, yes," he said, with a sense of disappointment.She was
barren of the art of the coquette."Why, of course I like you," she replied, prettily."Haven't you ever thought anything else about me?""I think you're very kind," she went on, even more bashfully; she
realized now that he was still holding her hand."Well," she said, with fluttering eyelids, "isn't that enough?"He looked at her, and the playful, companionable directness of her
answering gaze thrilled him through and through.He studied her face
in silence while she turned and twisted, feeling, but scarcely
understanding, the deep import of his scrutiny."Well," he said at last, "I think you're a fine girl.Don't you
think I'm a pretty nice man?"He leaned back in his chair and laughed at the unconscious drollery
of her reply."I really ought not to laugh,
though.I don't believe you like
me at all.""But I do, though," she replied, earnestly.Her eyes showed very plainly that she felt what she was
saying."Well," he said, drawing her gently down to him; then, at the same
instant, he pressed his lips to her cheek.she cried, straightening up, at once startled and
frightened.The senatorial quality
vanished in an instant.She recognized in him something that she had
not felt before.She was a woman to him, and
he was playing the part of a lover.She hesitated, but not knowing
just what to do, did nothing at all."Well," he said, "did I frighten you?"She looked at him, but moved by her underlying respect for this
great man, she said, with a smile, "Yes, you did.""I did it because I like you so much."She meditated upon this a moment, and then said, "I think I'd
better be going.""Now then," he pleaded, "are you going to run away because of
that?""No," she said, moved by a curious feeling of ingratitude; "but I
ought to be going."You're sure you're not angry about it?""No," she replied, and with more of a womanly air than she had ever
shown before.It was a novel experience to be in so authoritative a
position.It was so remarkable that it was somewhat confusing to both
of them."You're my girl, anyhow," the Senator said, rising."I'm going to
take care of you in the future."Jennie heard this, and it pleased her.He was so well fitted, she
thought, to do wondrous things; he was nothing less than a veritable
magician.She looked about her and the thought of coming into such a
life and such an atmosphere was heavenly.Not that she fully
understood his meaning, however.He meant to be good and generous, and
to give her fine things.She took up the
package that she had come for, not seeing or feeling the incongruity
of her position, while he felt it as a direct reproof."She ought not to carry that," he thought.A great wave of sympathy
swept over him.He took her cheeks between his hands, this time in a
superior and more generous way."Never mind, little girl," he said."You won't have to do this always.The outcome of this was simply a more sympathetic relationship
between them.He did not hesitate to ask her to sit beside him on the
arm of his chair the next time she came, and to question her
intimately about the family's condition and her own desires.Several
times he noticed that she was evading his questions, particularly in
regard to what her father was doing.She was ashamed to own that he
was sawing wood.Fearing lest something more serious was impending, he
decided to go out some day and see for himself.This he did when a convenient morning presented itself and his
other duties did not press upon him.It was three days before the
great fight in the Legislature began which ended in his defeat.Nothing could be done in these few remaining days.So he took his cane
and strolled forth, coming to the cottage in the course of a half
hour, and knocked boldly at the door."Good-morning," he said, cheerily; then, seeing her hesitate, he
added, "May I come in?"The good mother, who was all but overcome by his astonishing
presence, wiped her hands furtively upon her much-mended apron, and,
seeing that he waited for a reply, said:

"Oh yes.She hurried forward, forgetting to close the door, and, offering
him a chair, asked him to be seated.Brander, feeling sorry that he was the occasion of so much
confusion, said: "Don't trouble yourself, Mrs.I was passing
and thought I'd come in."He's well, thank you," returned the mother."He's out working
to-day."Gerhardt, who hesitated, like Jennie, to say
what it was."The children are all well now, and in school, I hope?"She had now unfastened her apron, and
was nervously turning it in her lap."That's good, and where is Jennie?"The latter, who had been ironing, had abandoned the board and had
concealed herself in the bedroom, where she was busy tidying herself
in the fear that her mother would not have the forethought to say that
she was out, and so let her have a chance for escape."What did you tell him I was here for?"Together they hesitated while the Senator surveyed the room.He
felt sorry to think that such deserving people must suffer so; he
intended, in a vague way, to ameliorate their condition if
possible."Good-morning," the Senator said to Jennie, when finally she came
hesitatingly into the room.Jennie came forward, extending her hand and blushing.She found
herself so much disturbed by this visit that she could hardly find
tongue to answer his questions."I thought," he said, "I'd come out and find where you live."You'll have to excuse the looks this morning.We've been ironing, and it's all upset.""I know," said Brander, gently."Don't you think I understand,
Jennie?She noticed the comforting, personal tone he always used with her
when she was at his room, and it helped to subdue her flustered
senses."You mustn't think it anything if I come here occasionally."Oh," said Jennie, "he's out to-day."While they were talking, however, the honest woodcutter was coming
in at the gate with his buck and saw.Brander saw him, and at once
recognized him by a slight resemblance to his daughter."There he is now, I believe," he said.Gerhardt, who was given to speculation these days, passed by the
window without looking up.He put his wooden buck down, and, hanging
his saw on a nail on the side of the house, came in."Mother," he called, in German, and, then not seeing her, he came
to the door of the front room and looked in.The knotted and weather-beaten
German came forward, and took it with a very questioning expression of
countenance.Brander," said Jennie, all her diffidence
dissolved by sympathy."This is the gentleman from the hotel, papa,
Mr."Oh yes," he said, with a considerable German accent."Since I had the fever I don't hear good.My wife, she spoke to me
of you.""Yes," said the Senator, "I thought I'd come out and make your
acquaintance."Yes," said the father, who was conscious of his very poor garments
and anxious to get away.Gerhardt now came back, and Gerhardt, seeing his chance, said
hurriedly:

"Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll go.I broke my saw, and so I had
to stop work.""Certainly," said Brander, graciously, realizing now why Jennie had
never wanted to explain.He half wished that she were courageous
enough not to conceal anything.Gerhardt," he said, when the mother was stiffly seated,
"I want to tell you that you mustn't look on me as a stranger.Hereafter I want you to keep me informed of how things are going with
you."Yes," she answered, humbly grateful.They talked for a few minutes, and then the Senator rose."Tell your husband," he said, "to come and see me next Monday at my
office in the hotel."I'll not stay any longer now," he added."Don't forget to have him
come.""Oh, he'll come," she returned.Adjusting a glove on one hand, he extended the other to Jennie."Well, I don't know," said her mother, "whether I could spare her
or not.""Well," said the Senator, going toward the door, and giving Mrs.Gerhardt his hand, "good-morning."He nodded and walked out, while a half-dozen neighbors, who had
observed his entrance, peeked from behind curtains and drawn blinds at
the astonishing sight."See what he gave me," said the innocent mother to her daughter the
moment he had closed the door.He had placed it softly in her hand as he
said good-by.CHAPTER V


Having been led by circumstances into an attitude of obligation
toward the Senator, it was not unnatural that Jennie should become
imbued with a most generous spirit of appreciation for everything he
had done and now continued to do.The Senator gave her father a letter
to a local mill owner, who saw that he received something to do.It
was not much, to be sure, a mere job as night-watchman, but it helped,
and old Gerhardt's gratitude was extravagant.Never was there such a
great, such a good man!Once Brander sent her a dress,
and at another time a shawl.All these benefactions were made in a
spirit of mingled charity and self-gratification, but to Mrs.Gerhardt
they glowed with but one motive.As for Jennie, he drew nearer to her in every possible way, so that
at last she came to see him in a light which would require
considerable analysis to make clear.This fresh, young soul, however,
had too much innocence and buoyancy to consider for a moment the
world's point of view.Since that one notable and halcyon visit upon
which he had robbed her her original shyness, and implanted a tender
kiss upon her cheek, they had lived in a different atmosphere.Jennie
was his companion now, and as he more and more unbended, and even
joyously flung aside the habiliments of his dignity, her perception of
him grew clearer.They laughed and chatted in a natural way, and he
keenly enjoyed this new entrance into the radiant world of youthful
happiness.One thing that disturbed him, however, was the occasional thought,
which he could not repress, that he was not doing right.Other people
must soon discover that he was not confining himself strictly to
conventional relations with this washer-woman's daughter.He suspected
that the housekeeper was not without knowledge that Jennie almost
invariably lingered from a quarter to three-quarters of an hour
whenever she came for or returned his laundry.He knew that it might
come to the ears of the hotel clerks, and so, in a general way, get
about town and work serious injury, but the reflection did not cause
him to modify his conduct.Sometimes he consoled himself with the
thought that he was not doing her any actual harm, and at other times
he would argue that he could not put this one delightful tenderness
out of his life.Did he not wish honestly to do her much good?He thought of these things occasionally, and decided that he could
not stop.The self-approval which such a resolution might bring him
was hardly worth the inevitable pain of the abnegation.He had not so
very many more years to live.One evening he put his arm around her and strained her to his
breast.Another time he drew her to his knee, and told her of his life
at Washington.Always now he had a caress and a kiss for her, but it
was still in a tentative, uncertain way.He did not want to reach for
her soul too deeply.Elements of fancy and novelty
entered into her life.She was an unsophisticated creature, emotional,
totally inexperienced in the matter of the affections, and yet mature
enough mentally to enjoy the attentions of this great man who had thus
bowed from his high position to make friends with her.One evening she pushed his hair back from his forehead as she stood
by his chair, and, finding nothing else to do, took out his watch.The
great man thrilled as he looked at her pretty innocence."Would you like to have a watch, too?""Yes, indeed, I would," said Jennie, with a deep breath.The next day he stopped as he was passing a jewelry store and
bought one.It was gold, and had pretty ornamented hands."Jennie," he said, when she came the next time, "I want to show you
something.Jennie drew out the watch from his waistcoat pocket and started in
surprise.she exclaimed, her face full of innocent
wonder."No," he said, delighted with his little deception.Her face shone with
light and her eyes fairly danced."See that you wear it now, and don't lose
it.""No," he said, but he held her at arm's length by the waist, to
make up his mind what his reward should be.Slowly he drew her toward
him until, when very close, she put her arms about his neck, and laid
her cheek in gratitude against his own.This was the quintessence of
pleasure for him.He felt as he had been longing to feel for
years.The progress of his idyl suffered a check when the great senatorial
fight came on in the Legislature.Attacked by a combination of rivals,
Brander was given the fight of his life.To his amazement he
discovered that a great railroad corporation, which had always been
friendly, was secretly throwing its strength in behalf of an already
too powerful candidate.Shocked by this defection, he was thrown
alternately into the deepest gloom and into paroxysms of wrath.These
slings of fortune, however lightly he pretended to receive them, never
failed to lacerate him.It had been long since he had suffered a
defeat--too long.During this period Jennie received her earliest lesson in the
vagaries of men.For two weeks she did not even see him, and one
evening, after an extremely comfortless conference with his leader, he
met her with the most chilling formality.When she knocked at his door
he only troubled to open it a foot, exclaiming almost harshly: "I
can't bother about the clothes to-night.Jennie retreated, shocked and surprised by this reception.She did
not know what to think of it.He was restored on the instant to his
far-off, mighty throne, and left to rule in peace.Why should he not
withdraw the light of his countenance if it pleased him.But
why--

A day or two later he repented mildly, but had no time to readjust
matters.His washing was taken and delivered with considerable
formality, and he went on toiling forgetfully, until at last he was
miserably defeated by two votes.Astounded by this result, he lapsed
into gloomy dejection of soul.Into this atmosphere came Jennie, bringing with her the lightness
and comfort of her own hopeful disposition.Nagged to desperation by
his thoughts, Brander first talked to her to amuse himself; but soon
his distress imperceptibly took flight; he found himself actually
smiling."Ah, Jennie," he said, speaking to her as he might have done to a
child, "youth is on your side.You possess the most valuable thing in
life.""Yes, but you don't realize it.You never will until it is too
late.""I love that girl," he thought to himself that night."I wish I
could have her with me always."But fortune had another fling for him to endure.It got about the
hotel that Jennie was, to use the mildest expression, conducting
herself strangely.A girl who carries washing must expect criticism if
anything not befitting her station is observed in her apparel.Jennie
was seen wearing the gold watch.Her mother was informed by the
housekeeper of the state of things."I thought I'd speak to you about it," she said.You'd better not let your daughter go to his room for the
laundry."Gerhardt was too astonished and hurt for utterance.Jennie had
told her nothing, but even now she did not believe there was anything
to tell.The watch had been both approved of and admired by her.She
had not thought that it was endangering her daughter's reputation.Going home she worried almost incessantly, and talked with Jennie
about it.The latter did not admit the implication that things had
gone too far.In fact, she did not look at it in that light.She did
not own, it is true, what really had happened while she was visiting
the Senator."It's so terrible that people should begin to talk!""Did you really stay so long in the room?""I don't know," returned Jennie, compelled by her conscience to
admit at least part of the truth."He has never said anything out of the way to you, has he?""No," answered her daughter, who did not attach any suspicion of
evil to what had passed between them.If the mother had only gone a little bit further she might have
learned more, but she was only too glad, for her own peace of mind, to
hush the matter up.People were slandering a good man, that she knew.Jennie had been the least bit indiscreet.How could the poor girl, amid such unfortunate circumstances,
do otherwise than she did.The result of it all was that she decided to get the washing
herself.She came to his door the next Monday after this decision.Brander,
who was expecting Jennie, was both surprised and disappointed."Why," he said to her, "what has become of Jennie?"Having hoped that he would not notice, or, at least, not comment
upon the change, Mrs.She looked up
at him weakly in her innocent, motherly way, and said, "She couldn't
come to-night.""I'm glad to hear that," he said resignedly.After she
had gone he got to thinking the matter over, and wondered what could
have happened.It seemed rather odd that he should be wondering over
it.On Saturday, however, when she returned the clothes he felt that
there must be something wrong."Has anything
happened to your daughter?""No, sir," she returned, too troubled to wish to deceive him."Isn't she coming for the laundry any more?""I--I--" ventured the mother, stammering in her
perturbation; "she--they have been talking about her," she at
last forced herself to say.he interrupted, a touch of annoyance showing in
his voice."And she told you that, did she?""She
ventures to trouble herself about my affairs, does she?I wonder
people can't mind their own business without interfering with mine.I have no
intention of doing her an injury.It's a shame," he added indignantly,
"that a girl can't come to my room in this hotel without having her
motive questioned."I hope you don't think that I have anything to do with it," said
the mother apologetically."I know you like Jennie and wouldn't injure
her.You've done so much for her and all of us, Mr.Brander, I feel
ashamed to keep her away."It is the lying
accusation passed about in this hotel that I object to.She was afraid she
had deeply offended this man who had done so much for them.If she
could only say something, she thought, that would clear this matter up
and make him feel that she was no tattler."I thought I was doing everything for the best," she said at
last.I have always
enjoyed her coming here.It is my intention to do well by her, but
perhaps it will be better to keep her away, at least for the
present."Again that evening the Senator sat in his easy-chair and brooded
over this new development.Jennie was really much more precious to him
than he had thought.Now that he had no hope of seeing her there any
more, he began to realize how much these little visits of hers had
meant.He thought the matter over very carefully, realized instantly
that there was nothing to be done so far as the hotel gossip was
concerned, and concluded that he had really placed the girl in a very
unsatisfactory position."Perhaps I had better end this little affair," he thought."It
isn't a wise thing to pursue."On the strength of this conclusion he went to Washington and
finished his term.Then he returned to Columbus to await the friendly
recognition from the President which was to send him upon some
ministry abroad.Jennie had not been forgotten in the least.The
longer he stayed away the more eager he was to get back.When he was
again permanently settled in his old quarters he took up his cane one
morning and strolled out in the direction of the cottage.Arriving
there, he made up his mind to go in, and knocking at the door, he was
greeted by Mrs.Gerhardt and her daughter with astonished and
diffident smiles.He explained vaguely that he had been away, and
mentioned his laundry as if that were the object of his visit.Then,
when chance gave him a few moments with Jennie alone, he plunged in
boldly."How would you like to take a drive with me to-morrow evening?""I'd like it," said Jennie, to whom the proposition was a glorious
novelty.He smiled and patted her cheek, foolishly happy to see her again.Graced with her clean white
apron, her shapely head crowned by the glory of her simply plaited
hair, she was a pleasing sight for any man to look upon.Gerhardt returned, and then, having
accomplished the purpose of his visit, he arose."I'm going to take your daughter out riding to-morrow evening," he
explained."I want to talk to her about her future."She saw nothing incongruous
in the proposal.They parted with smiles and much handshaking."That man has the best heart," commented Mrs."Doesn't he
always speak so nicely of you?"I don't know whether we had better tell your father or not,"
concluded Mrs."He doesn't like for you to be out
evenings."He could see by the weak-flamed,
unpretentious parlor-lamp that she was dressed for him, and that the
occasion had called out the best she had.A pale lavender gingham,
starched and ironed, until it was a model of laundering, set off her
pretty figure to perfection.There were little lace-edged cuffs and a
rather high collar attached to it.She had no gloves, nor any jewelry,
nor yet a jacket good enough to wear, but her hair was done up in such
a dainty way that it set off her well-shaped head better than any hat,
and the few ringlets that could escape crowned her as with a halo.When Brander suggested that she should wear a jacket she hesitated a
moment; then she went in and borrowed her mother's cape, a plain gray
woolen one.Brander realized now that she had no jacket, and suffered
keenly to think that she had contemplated going without one."She would have endured the raw night air," he thought, "and said
nothing of it."He looked at her and shook his head reflectively.Then they
started, and he quickly forgot everything but the great fact that she
was at his side.She talked with freedom and with a gentle girlish
enthusiasm that he found irresistibly charming."Why, Jennie," he said, when she had called upon him to notice how
soft the trees looked, where, outlined dimly against the new rising
moon, they were touched with its yellow light, "you're a great one.I
believe you would write poetry if you were schooled a little."You're the dearest little day-dreamer in the
world.This eulogy touched her as nothing else possibly could have done.No one ever seemed to like or
to appreciate her half as much as he did.They rode still farther, until suddenly remembering, he said: "I
wonder what time it is.Jennie started, for this watch had been the one thing of which she
had hoped he would not speak.Ever since he had returned it had been
on her mind.In his absence the family finances had become so strained that she
had been compelled to pawn it.Martha had got to that place in the
matter of apparel where she could no longer go to school unless
something new were provided for her.And so, after much discussion, it
was decided that the watch must go.Bass took it, and after much argument with the local pawn broker,
he had been able to bring home ten dollars.Gerhardt expended the
money upon her children, and heaved a sigh of relief.Now, however, when the Senator spoke of it, her hour of retribution
seemed at hand.She actually trembled, and he noticed her
discomfiture."Why, Jennie," he said gently, "what made you start like that?"She paused, for it seemed impossible to tell a deliberate
falsehood.There was a strained silence; then she said, with a voice
that had too much of a sob in it for him not to suspect the truth,
"No, sir.""Well," he said, "dearest, don't feel badly about it.Hereafter when you
need anything I want you to come to me.I want you to
promise me that.If I'm not here, I want you to write me.I'll always
be in touch with you from now on.Just let
me know, and I'll help you."You'll promise to do that now, will you?'"Jennie," he said at last, the spring-like quality of the night
moving him to a burst of feeling, "I've about decided that I can't do
without you.Do you think you could make up your mind to live with me
from now on?"Jennie looked away, not clearly understanding his words as he meant
them."I don't know," she said vaguely."Well, you think about it," he said pleasantly.Would
you be willing to marry me, and let me put you away in a seminary for
a few years?"He looked around at her, and tried to make out the expression on
her face.The moon was now above the trees in the
east, and already the vast host of stars were paling before it."Don't you care for me at all, Jennie?""You never come for my laundry any more, though," he returned
pathetically."I didn't do that," she answered."I couldn't help it; Mother
thought it was best."You'd be glad to come if you could, wouldn't you?""Yes, I would," she answered frankly.He took her hand and pressed it so feelingly that all his kindly
words seemed doubly emphasized to her.Reaching up impulsively, she
put her arms about him."You're so good to me," she said with the
loving tone of a daughter."You're my girl, Jennie," he said with deep feeling."I'd do
anything in the world for you."CHAPTER VI


The father of this unfortunate family, William Gerhardt, was a man
of considerable interest on his personal side.Born in the kingdom of
Saxony, he had had character enough to oppose the army conscription
iniquity, and to flee, in his eighteenth year, to Paris.From there he
had set forth for America, the land of promise.Arrived in this country, he had made his way, by slow stages, from
New York to Philadelphia, and thence westward, working for a time in
the various glass factories in Pennsylvania.In one romantic village
of this new world he had found his heart's ideal.With her, a simple
American girl of German extraction, he had removed to Youngstown, and
thence to Columbus, each time following a glass manufacturer by the
name of Hammond, whose business prospered and waned by turns.Gerhardt was an honest man, and he liked to think that others
appreciated his integrity."William," his employer used to say to him,
"I want you because I can trust you," and this, to him, was more than
silver and gold.This honesty, like his religious convictions, was wholly due to
inheritance.Father and grandfather
before him were sturdy German artisans, who had never cheated anybody
out of a dollar, and this honesty of intention came into his veins
undiminished.His Lutheran proclivities had been strengthened by years of
church-going and the religious observances of home life, In his
father's cottage the influence of the Lutheran minister had been
all-powerful; he had inherited the feeling that the Lutheran Church
was a perfect institution, and that its teachings were of
all-importance when it came to the issue of the future life.His wife,
nominally of the Mennonite faith, was quite willing to accept her
husband's creed.And so his household became a God-fearing one;
wherever they went their first public step was to ally themselves with
the local Lutheran church, and the minister was always a welcome guest
in the Gerhardt home.Pastor Wundt, the shepherd of the Columbus church, was a sincere
and ardent Christian, but his bigotry and hard-and-fast orthodoxy made
him intolerant.He considered that the members of his flock were
jeopardizing their eternal salvation if they danced, played cards, or
went to theaters, and he did not hesitate to declare vociferously that
hell was yawning for those who disobeyed his injunctions.Drinking,
even temperately, was a sin.Right conduct in marriage, however, and innocence before that state
were absolute essentials of Christian living.Let no one talk of
salvation, he had said, for a daughter who had failed to keep her
chastity unstained, or for the parents who, by negligence, had
permitted her to fall.You must walk
the straight and narrow way if you would escape eternal punishment,
and a just God was angry with sinners every day.Gerhardt and his wife, and also Jennie, accepted the doctrines of
their Church as expounded by Mr.With Jennie,
however, the assent was little more than nominal.Religion had as yet
no striking hold upon her.It was a pleasant thing to know that there
was a heaven, a fearsome one to realize that there was a hell.Young
girls and boys ought to be good and obey their parents.Otherwise the
whole religious problem was badly jumbled in her mind.Gerhardt was convinced that everything spoken from the pulpit of
his church was literally true.Death and the future life were
realities to him.Now that the years were slipping away and the problem of the world
was becoming more and more inexplicable, he clung with pathetic
anxiety to the doctrines which contained a solution.Oh, if he could
only be so honest and upright that the Lord might have no excuse for
ruling him out.He trembled not only for himself, but for his wife and
children.Would he not some day be held responsible for them?Would
not his own laxity and lack of system in inculcating the laws of
eternal life to them end in his and their damnation?He pictured to
himself the torments of hell, and wondered how it would be with him
and his in the final hour.Naturally, such a deep religious feeling made him stern with his
children.He was prone to scan with a narrow eye the pleasures and
foibles of youthful desire.Jennie was never to have a lover if her
father had any voice in the matter.Any flirtation with the youths she
might meet upon the streets of Columbus could have no continuation in
her home.Gerhardt forgot that he was once young himself, and looked
only to the welfare of her spirit.So the Senator was a novel factor
in her life.When he first began to be a part of their family affairs the
conventional standards of Father Gerhardt proved untrustworthy.He had
no means of judging such a character.This was no ordinary person
coquetting with his pretty daughter.The manner in which the Senator
entered the family life was so original and so plausible that he
became an active part before any one thought anything about it.Gerhardt himself was deceived, and, expecting nothing but honor and
profit to flow to the family from such a source, accepted the interest
and the service, and plodded peacefully on.His wife did not tell him
of the many presents which had come before and since the wonderful
Christmas.But one morning as Gerhardt was coming home from his night work a
neighbor named Otto Weaver accosted him."Gerhardt," he said, "I want to speak a word with you.As a friend
of yours, I want to tell you what I hear.The neighbors, you know,
they talk now about the man who comes to see your daughter."said Gerhardt, more puzzled and pained by this
abrupt attack than mere words could indicate.I
don't know of any one who comes to see my daughter."inquired Weaver, nearly as much astonished as the recipient
of his confidences."The middle-aged man, with gray hair.Gerhardt racked his memory with a puzzled face."They say he was a senator once," went on Weaver, doubtful of what
he had got into; "I don't know.""Ah," returned Gerhardt, measurably relieved."It is nothing," returned the neighbor, "only they talk.He is no
longer a young man, you know.Your daughter, she goes out with him now
a few times.These people, they see that, and now they talk about her.Gerhardt was shocked to the depths of his being by these terrible
words.People must have a reason for saying such things.Jennie and
her mother were seriously at fault.Still he did not hesitate to
defend his daughter."He is a friend of the family," he said confusedly."People should
not talk until they know."People talk before
they have any grounds.Gerhardt stood there motionless another minute or so t his jaw
fallen and a strange helplessness upon him.The world was such a grim
thing to have antagonistic to you.Its opinions and good favor were so
essential.How hard he had tried to live up to its rules!Why should
it not be satisfied and let him alone?"I am glad you told me," he murmured as he started homeward.Gerhardt took the first opportunity to question his wife."What is this about Senator Brander coming out to call on Jennie?"She
was decidedly taken aback at his question."He did call two or three
times.""You didn't tell me that," he returned, a sense of her frailty in
tolerating and shielding such weakness in one of their children
irritating him."No," she replied, absolutely nonplussed."He has only been here
two or three times."exclaimed Gerhardt, the German tendency to
talk loud coming upon him."He only called two or three times," Mrs."Weaver comes to me on the street," continued Gerhardt, "and tells
me that my neighbors are talking of the man my daughter is going with."There is nothing the matter," declared the mother, using an
effective German idiom."Jennie has gone walking with him once or
twice.What is there now in that for
the people to talk about?Can't the girl have any pleasure at
all?""But he is an old man," returned Gerhardt, voicing the words of
Weaver.What should he want to call on a girl
like Jennie for?"I don't know anything but good about the man.All that he knew of the Senator was
excellent.What was there now that was so terrible about it?They haven't got anything else
to talk about now, so they talk about Jennie.You know whether she is
a good girl or not.and tears came
into the soft little mother's eyes."That is all right," grumbled Gerhardt, "but he ought not to want
to come around and take a girl of her age out walking.It looks bad,
even if he don't mean any harm."She had heard the talking in the
front bedroom, where she slept with one of the children, but had not
suspected its import.Now her mother turned her back and bent over the
table where she was making biscuit, in order that her daughter might
not see her red eyes.she inquired, vaguely troubled by the tense
stillness in the attitude of both her parents.Gerhardt made no sign, but her very immobility told something.Jennie went over to her and quickly discovered that she had been
weeping.she repeated wonderingly, gazing at her
father.Gerhardt only stood there, his daughter's innocence dominating his
terror of evil."Oh, it's the neighbors," returned the mother brokenly."They're always ready to talk about something they don't know
anything about."inquired Jennie, her face flushing faintly."You see," observed Gerhardt, apparently addressing the world in
general, "she knows.Now, why didn't you tell me that he was coming
here?The neighbors talk, and I hear nothing about it until to-day.What kind of a way is that, anyhow?""Oh," exclaimed Jennie, out of the purest sympathy for her mother,
"what difference does it make?"cried Gerhardt, still talking in German,
although Jennie answered in English."Is it no difference that men
stop me on the street and speak of it?You should be ashamed of
yourself to say that.I always thought well of this man, but now,
since you don't tell me about him, and the neighbors talk, I don't
know what to think.Must I get my knowledge of what is going on in my
own home from my neighbors?"Jennie had already begun to think that
their error was serious."I didn't keep anything from you because it was evil," she said."Why, he only took me out riding once.""Yes, but you didn't tell me that," answered her father."You know you don't like for me to go out after dark," replied
Jennie.There wasn't anything else to hide about
it.""He shouldn't want you to go out after dark with him," observed
Gerhardt, always mindful of the world outside.I don't think you
ought to have anything to do with him--such a young girl as you
are.""He doesn't want to do anything except help me," murmured Jennie.I won't have him running around with my
daughter, and the neighbors talking.He ought to know better than to put a girl where she
gets talked about.This threat of Gerhardt's, that he would tell Brander to stay away,
seemed simply terrible to Jennie and to her mother.What good could
come of any such attitude?Of
course Brander did call again, while Gerhardt was away at work, and
they trembled lest the father should hear of it.A few days later the
Senator came and took Jennie for a long walk.Neither she nor her
mother said anything to Gerhardt.But he was not to be put off the
scent for long."Has Jennie been out again with that man?""He was here last night," returned the mother, evasively."Did she tell him he shouldn't come any more?""Well, now, I will see for myself once whether this thing will be
stopped or not," said the determined father.In accordance with this, he took occasion to come up from his
factory on three different evenings, each time carefully surveying the
house, in order to discover whether any visitor was being entertained.On the fourth evening Brander came, and inquiring for Jennie, who was
exceedingly nervous, he took her out for a walk.She was afraid of her
father, lest some unseemly things should happen, but did not know
exactly what to do.Gerhardt, who was on his way to the house at the time, observed her
departure.Walking deliberately in upon his
wife, he said:

"Where is Jennie?""She is out somewhere," said her mother."Yes, I know where," said Gerhardt.He sat down calmly, reading a German paper and keeping an eye upon
his wife, until, at last, the gate clicked, and the front door opened.Brander, who had not suspected that any trouble of this character
was pending, felt irritated and uncomfortable.Her mother was suffering an agony of torment in the
kitchen."Why, I have been out for a walk," she answered confusedly."Didn't I tell you not to go out any more after dark?"said
Gerhardt, utterly ignoring Brander.Jennie colored furiously, unable to speak a word."Why should you
talk to her like that?""She should not go out after dark," returned the father rudely."I
have told her two or three times now.I don't think you ought to come
here any more, either."asked the Senator, pausing to consider and choose his
words.exclaimed Gerhardt, his excitement growing
under the strain he was enduring, and speaking almost unaccented
English in consequence."She is running around the streets at night
when she oughtn't to be.I don't want my daughter taken out after dark
by a man of your age.said the Senator, straining to regain his ruffled dignity."I want to talk with her, of course.She is old enough to be
interesting to me.I want to marry her if she will have me.""I want you to go out of here and stay out of here," returned the
father, losing all sense of logic, and descending to the ordinary
level of parental compulsion."I don't want you to come around my
house any more.I have enough trouble without my daughter being taken
out and given a bad name.""I tell you frankly," said the Senator, drawing himself up to his
full height, "that you will have to make clear your meaning.I have
done nothing that I am ashamed of.Your daughter has not come to any
harm through me.Now, I want to know what you mean by conducting
yourself in this manner.""I mean," said Gerhardt, excitedly repeating himself, "I mean, I
mean that the whole neighborhood talks about how you come around here,
and have buggy-rides and walks with my daughter when I am not
here--that's what I mean.I mean that you are no man of honorable
intentions, or you would not come taking up with a little girl who is
only old enough to be your daughter.People tell me well enough what
you are."Well, I care nothing for your people.I love your daughter, and I am here to see her because I do love her.It is my intention to marry her, and if your neighbors have anything
to say to that, let them say it.There is no reason why you should
conduct yourself in this manner before you know what my intentions
are."Unnerved by this unexpected and terrible altercation, Jennie had
backed away to the door leading out into the dining-room, and her
mother, seeing her, came forward."Oh," said the latter, breathing excitedly, "he came home when you
were away.They clung together, as women do, and
wept silently."Marry, eh," exclaimed the father."Yes," said the Senator, "marry, that is exactly it.Your daughter
is eighteen years of age and can decide for herself.You have insulted
me and outraged your daughter's feelings.Now, I wish you to know that
it cannot stop here.If you have any cause to say anything against me
outside of mere hearsay I wish you to say it."The Senator stood before him, a very citadel of righteousness.He
was neither loud-voiced nor angry-mannered, but there was a tightness
about his lips which bespoke the man of force and determination."I don't want to talk to you any more," returned Gerhardt, who was
checked but not overawed.I am the one
who will say whether she shall go out at night, or whether she shall
marry you, either.When I first met
you I thought you were a fine man, but now, since I see the way you
conduct yourself with my daughter, I don't want anything more to do
with you.Gerhardt," said Brander, turning deliberately
away from the angry father, "to have had such an argument in your
home.I had no idea that your husband was opposed to my visits.However, I will leave the matter as it stands for the present.You
must not take all this as badly as it seems."Gerhardt looked on in astonishment at his coolness."I will go now," he said, again addressing Gerhardt, "but you
mustn't think that I am leaving this matter for good.You have made a
serious mistake this evening."Now," he said, turning to his
daughter and wife, "we will see whether we are rid of him or not.I
will show you how to go after night upon the streets when everybody is
talking already."In so far as words were concerned, the argument ceased, but looks
and feeling ran strong and deep, and for days thereafter scarcely a
word was spoken in the little cottage.Gerhardt began to brood over
the fact that he had accepted his place from the Senator and decided
to give it up.He made it known that no more of the Senator's washing
was to be done in their house, and if he had not been sure that Mrs.Gerhardt's hotel work was due to her own efforts in finding it he
would have stopped that.No good would come out of it, anyway.If she
had never gone to the hotel all this talk would never have come upon
them.As for the Senator, he went away decidedly ruffled by this crude
occurrence.Neighborhood slanders are bad enough on their own plane,
but for a man of his standing to descend and become involved in one
struck him now as being a little bit unworthy.He did not know what to
do about the situation, and while he was trying to come to some
decision several days went by.Then he was called to Washington, and
he went away without having seen Jennie again.In the mean time the Gerhardt family struggled along as before.They were poor, indeed, but Gerhardt was willing to face poverty if
only it could be endured with honor.The grocery bills were of the
same size, however.Economy had to be practised, and payments stopped on old bills that
Gerhardt was trying to adjust.Then came a day when the annual interest on the mortgage was due,
and yet another when two different grocery-men met Gerhardt on the
street and asked about their little bills.He did not hesitate to
explain just what the situation was, and to tell them with convincing
honesty that he would try hard and do the best he could.But his
spirit was unstrung by his misfortunes.He prayed for the favor of
Heaven while at his labor, and did not hesitate to use the daylight
hours that he should have had for sleeping to go about--either
looking for a more remunerative position or to obtain such little jobs
as he could now and then pick up.One of them was that of cutting
grass.Gerhardt protested that he was killing himself, but he
explained his procedure by pointing to their necessity."When people stop me on the street and ask me for money I have no
time to sleep."It was a distressing situation for all of them.To cap it all, Sebastian got in jail.It was that old coal-stealing
ruse of his practised once too often.He got up on a car one evening
while Jennie and the children waited for him, and a railroad detective
arrested him.There had been a good deal of coal stealing during the
past two years, but so long as it was confined to moderate quantities
the railroad took no notice.When, however, customers of shippers
complained that cars from the Pennsylvania fields lost thousands of
pounds in transit to Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago, and other points,
detectives were set to work.Gerhardt's children were not the only
ones who preyed upon the railroad in this way.Other families in
Columbus--many of them--were constantly doing the same thing,
but Sebastian happened to be seized upon as the Columbus example."You come off that car now," said the detective, suddenly appearing
out of the shadow.Jennie and the other children dropped their baskets
and buckets and fled for their lives.Sebastian's first impulse was to
jump and run, but when he tried it the detective grabbed him by the
coat."Aw, let go," said Sebastian savagely, for he was no weakling.There was nerve and determination in him, as well as a keen sense of
his awkward predicament."Let go, I tell you," he reiterated, and giving a jerk, he almost
upset his captor."Come here now," said the detective, pulling him viciously in an
effort to establish his authority.Sebastian came, but it was with a blow which staggered his
adversary.There was more struggling, and then a passing railroad hand came to
the detective's assistance.Together they hurried him toward the
depot, and there discovering the local officer, turned him over.It
was with a torn coat, scarred hands and face, and a black eye that
Sebastian was locked up for the night.When the children came home they could not say what had happened to
their brother, but as nine o'clock struck, and then ten and eleven,
and Sebastian did not return, Mrs.He had
stayed out many a night as late as twelve and one, but his mother had
a foreboding of something terrible tonight.When half-past one
arrived, and no Sebastian, she began to cry."Some one ought to go up and tell your father," she said.Jennie volunteered, but George, who was soundly sleeping, was
awakened to go along with her.said Gerhardt, astonished to see his two children."Bass hasn't come yet," said Jennie, and then told the story of the
evening's adventure in explanation.Gerhardt left his work at once, walking back with his two children
to a point where he could turn off to go to the jail.He guessed what
had happened, and his heart was troubled.he repeated nervously, rubbing his clumsy hands
across his wet forehead.Arrived at the station-house, the sergeant in charge told him
curtly that Bass was under arrest.he said, looking over his blotter; "yes, here
he is.He actually wrung his
hands in distress."Take him back, Fred," said the other to the old watchman in
charge, "and let him see the boy."When Gerhardt stood in the back room, and Sebastian was brought out
all marked and tousled, he broke down and began to cry.No word could
cross his lips because of his emotion."Don't cry, pop," said Sebastian bravely."Don't cry," continued Sebastian, doing his very best to restrain
his own tears."I know, I know," said the gray-headed parent brokenly, "but I
can't help it.It is my fault that I should let you do that.""No, no, it isn't," said Sebastian."Jennie and George just came up
where I was and told me.I didn't know anything about it until just
now," and he began to cry again."Well, don't you feel badly," went on Bass, the finest part of his
nature coming to the surface.Just you go back to
work now, and don't worry.asked the father, looking at him with
red eyes."Oh, I had a little wrestling match with the man who nabbed me,"
said the boy, smiling bravely."You shouldn't do that, Sebastian," said the father."It may go
harder with you on that account."In the morning, they told me," said Bass.Gerhardt stayed with his son for some time, and discussed the
question of bail, fine, and the dire possibility of a jail sentence
without arriving at any definite conclusion.Finally he was persuaded
by Bass to go away, but the departure was the occasion for another
outburst of feeling; he was led away shaking and broken with
emotion."It's pretty tough," said Bass to himself as he was led back to his
cell."I wish I'd knocked the
dub over the first crack," he said."What a fool I was not to get
away."CHAPTER VII


Gerhardt was in despair; he did not know any one to whom he could
appeal between the hours of two and nine o'clock in the morning.He
went back to talk with his wife, and then to his post of duty.He could think of only one friend who was able, or
possibly willing to do anything.This was the glass manufacturer,
Hammond; but he was not in the city.Gerhardt did not know this,
however.When nine o'clock came, he went alone to the court, for it was
thought advisable that the others should stay away.Gerhardt was
to hear immediately what happened.When Sebastian was lined up inside the dock he had to wait a long
time, for there were several prisoners ahead of him.Finally his name
was called, and the boy was pushed forward to the bar."Stealing coal,
Your Honor, and resisting arrest," explained the officer who had
arrested him.The magistrate looked at Sebastian closely; he was unfavorably
impressed by the lad's scratched and wounded face."Well, young man," he said, "what have you to say for yourself?Sebastian looked at the judge, but did not answer."He was on one of the
company's cars.He tried to break away from me, and when I held him he
assaulted me.This man here was a witness," he added, turning to the
railroad hand who had helped him.asked the Court, observing the
detective's swollen jaw."Yes, sir," he returned, glad of an opportunity to be further
revenged."If you please," put in Gerhardt, leaning forward, "he is my boy.He--"

"We don't mind what they pick up around the yard," interrupted the
detective, "but he was throwing it off the cars to half a dozen
others.""Can't you earn enough to keep from taking coal off the coal cars?"asked the Court; but before either father or son had time to answer he
added, "What is your business?""I am watchman at Miller's furniture factory.""Um," said the court, feeling that Sebastian's attitude remained
sullen and contentious."Well, this young man might be let off on the
coal-stealing charge, but he seems to be somewhat too free with his
fists.Columbus is altogether too rich in that sort of thing."If you please," began Gerhardt, but the court officer was already
pushing him away."I don't want to hear any more about it," said the judge."He's
stubborn, anyhow.Gerhardt made his way over to his boy, abashed and yet very glad it
was no worse.Somehow, he thought, he could raise the money.Sebastian
looked at him solicitously as he came forward."It's all right," said Bass soothingly."He didn't give me half a
chance to say anything.""I'm only glad it wasn't more," said Gerhardt nervously."We will
try and get the money."Going home to his wife, Gerhardt informed the troubled household of
the result.Gerhardt stood white and yet relieved, for ten
dollars seemed something that might be had.Jennie heard the whole
story with open mouth and wide eyes.He was always so lively and good-natured.It seemed awful
that he should be in jail.Gerhardt went hurriedly to Hammond's fine residence, but he was not
in the city.He thought then of a lawyer by the name of Jenkins, whom
he knew in a casual way, but Jenkins was not at his office.There were
several grocers and coal merchants whom he knew well enough, but he
owed them money.Pastor Wundt might let him have it, but the agony
such a disclosure to that worthy would entail held him back.He did
call on one or two acquaintances, but these, surprised at the unusual
and peculiar request, excused themselves.At four o'clock he returned
home, weary and exhausted."I don't know what to do," he said despairingly.Jennie thought of Brander, but the situation had not accentuated
her desperation to the point where she could brave her father's
opposition and his terrible insult to the Senator, so keenly
remembered, to go and ask.Her watch had been pawned a second time,
and she had no other means of obtaining money.The family council lasted until half-past ten, but still there was
nothing decided.Gerhardt persistently and monotonously turned
one hand over in the other and stared at the floor.Gerhardt ran his
hand through his reddish brown hair distractedly."It's no use," he
said at last."Go to bed, Jennie," said her mother solicitously; "get the others
to go.There's no use their sitting up I may think of something.Jennie went to her room, but the very thought of repose was
insupportable.She had read in the paper, shortly after her father's
quarrel with the Senator, that the latter had departed for Washington.She stood before a short, narrow mirror that surmounted a shabby
bureau, thinking.Her sister Veronica, with whom she slept, was
already composing herself to dreams.Finally a grim resolution fixed
itself in her consciousness.If
he were in town he would help Bass.Why shouldn't she--he
loved her.He had asked over and over to marry her.Why should she not
go and ask him for help?She hesitated a little while, then hearing Veronica breathing
regularly, she put on her hat and jacket, and noiselessly opened the
door into the sitting-room to see if any one were stirring.There was no sound save that of Gerhardt rocking nervously to and
fro in the kitchen.There was no light save that of her own small
room-lamp and a gleam from under the kitchen door.She turned and blew
the former out--then slipped quietly to the front door, opened it
and stepped out into the night.A waning moon was shining, and a hushed sense of growing life
filled the air, for it was nearing spring again.As Jennie hurried
along the shadowy streets--the arc light had not yet been
invented--she had a sinking sense of fear; what was this rash
thing she was about to do?She stood stock-still, wavering and doubtful; then the
recollection of Bass in his night cell came over her again, and she
hurried on.The character of the Capitol Hotel was such that it was not
difficult for a woman to find ingress through the ladies' entrance to
the various floors of the hotel at any hour of the night.The hotel,
not unlike many others of the time, was in no sense loosely conducted,
but its method of supervision in places was lax.Any person could
enter, and, by applying at a rear entrance to the lobby, gain the
attention of the clerk.Otherwise not much notice was taken of those
who came and went.When she came to the door it was dark save for a low light burning
in the entry-way.The distance to the Senator's room was only a short
way along the hall of the second floor.She hurried up the steps,
nervous and pale, but giving no other outward sign of the storm that
was surging within her.When she came to his familiar door she paused;
she feared that she might not find him in his room; she trembled again
to think that he might be there.A light shone through the transom,
and, summoning all her courage, she knocked.A man coughed and
bestirred himself.His surprise as he opened the door knew no bounds."I was coming out to see you, believe me, I was.I was thinking all
along how I could straighten this matter out.He held her at arm's length and studied her distressed face.The
fresh beauty of her seemed to him like cut lilies wet with dew."I have something to ask you," she at last brought herself to say.We need ten dollars to get him out, and I
didn't know where else to go."Haven't I told you always to come to me?Don't you know, Jennie, I
would do anything in the world for you?""Well, then, don't worry about that any more.But won't fate ever
cease striking at you, poor child?How did your brother come to get in
jail?""They caught him throwing coal down from the cars," she
replied.he replied, his sympathies touched and awakened.Here was
this boy arrested and fined for what fate was practically driving him
to do.Here was this girl pleading with him at night, in his room, for
what to her was a great necessity--ten dollars; to him, a mere
nothing."I will arrange about your brother," he said quickly.I can get him out in half an hour.You sit here now and be
comfortable until I return."He waved her to his easy-chair beside a large lamp, and hurried out
of the room.Brander knew the sheriff who had personal supervision of the county
jail.He knew the judge who had administered the fine.It was but a
five minutes' task to write a note to the judge asking him to revoke
the fine, for the sake of the boy's character, and send it by a
messenger to his home.Another ten minutes' task to go personally to
the jail and ask his friend, the sheriff, to release the boy then and
there."If the fine is revoked you can
return it to me.He hastened below to
personally supervise the task, and Bass, a very much astonished boy,
was set free."That's all right now," said the turnkey.Run
along home and don't let them catch you at anything like that
again."Bass went his way wondering, and the ex-Senator returned to his
hotel trying to decide just how this delicate situation should be
handled.Obviously Jennie had not told her father of her mission.She was now waiting for him in his
room.There are crises in all men's lives when they waver between the
strict fulfilment of justice and duty and the great possibilities for
personal happiness which another line of conduct seems to assure.And
the dividing line is not always marked and clear.He knew that the
issue of taking her, even as his wife, was made difficult by the
senseless opposition of her father.The opinion of the world brought
up still another complication.Supposing he should take her openly,
what would the world say?She was a significant type emotionally, that
he knew.There was something there--artistically,
temperamentally, which was far and beyond the keenest suspicion of the
herd.He did not know himself quite what it was, but he felt a
largeness of feeling not altogether squared with intellect, or perhaps
better yet, experience, which was worthy of any man's desire."This
remarkable girl," he thought, seeing her clearly in his mind's
eye.Meditating as to what he should do, he returned to his hotel, and
the room.As he entered he was struck anew with her beauty, and with
the irresistible appeal of her personality.In the glow of the shaded
lamp she seemed a figure of marvelous potentiality."Well," he said, endeavoring to appear calm, "I have looked after
your brother."Oh," she exclaimed, clasping her hands and stretching her arms out
toward him.There were tears of gratefulness in her eyes."Jennie, for heaven's sake
don't cry," he entreated.To think
you should have to add tears to your other sacrifices."He drew her to him, and then all the caution of years deserted him.There was a sense both of need and of fulfilment in his mood.At last,
in spite of other losses, fate had brought him what he most
desired--love, a woman whom he could love.He took her in his
arms, and kissed her again and again.The English Jefferies has told us that it requires a hundred and
fifty years to make a perfect maiden."From all enchanted things of
earth and air, this preciousness has been drawn.From the south wind
that breathed a century and a half over the green wheat; from the
perfume of the growing grasses waving over heavy-laden clover and
laughing veronica, hiding the green finches, baffling the bee; from
rose-lined hedge, woodbine, and cornflower, azure blue, where
yellowing wheat stalks crowd up under the shadow of green firs.All
the devious brooklets' sweetness where the iris stays the sunlight;
all the wild woods hold of beauty; all the broad hills of thyme and
freedom thrice a hundred years repeated."A hundred years of cowslips, bluebells, violets; purple spring and
golden autumn; sunshine, shower, and dewy mornings; the night
immortal; all the rhythm of time unrolling.A chronicle unwritten and
past all power of writing; who shall preserve a record of the petals
that fell from the roses a century ago?The swallows to the house-tops
three hundred--times think of that!Thence she sprang, and the
world yearns toward her beauty as to flowers that are past.The
loveliness of seventeen is centuries old.If you have understood and appreciated the beauty of harebells
three hundred times repeated; if the quality of the roses, of the
music, of the ruddy mornings and evenings of the world has ever
touched your heart; if all beauty were passing, and you were given
these things to hold in your arms before the world slipped away, would
you give them up?CHAPTER VIII


The significance of the material and spiritual changes which
sometimes overtake us are not very clear at the time.A sense of
shock, a sense of danger, and then apparently we subside to old ways,
but the change has come.Never again, here or elsewhere, will we be
the same.Jennie pondering after the subtle emotional turn which her
evening's sympathetic expedition had taken, was lost in a vague
confusion of emotions.She had no definite realization of what social
and physical changes this new relationship to the Senator might
entail.She was not conscious as yet of that shock which the
possibility of maternity, even under the most favorable conditions,
must bring to the average woman.Her present attitude was one of
surprise, wonder, uncertainty; and at the same time she experienced a
genuine feeling of quiet happiness.Brander was a good man; now he was
closer to her than ever.Because of this new
relationship a change in her social condition was to inevitably
follow.Life was to be radically different from now on--was
different at this moment.Brander assured her over and over of his
enduring affection."I tell you, Jennie," he repeated, as she was leaving, "I don't
want you to worry.This emotion of mine got the best of me, but I'll
marry you.I've been carried off my feet, but I'll make it up to you.Caution your brother, if it isn't too
late.Keep your own counsel, and I will marry you and take you away.But I'm going to
Washington, and I'll send for you.And here"--he reached for his
purse and took from it a hundred dollars, practically all he had with
him, "take that.You're my girl
now--remember that.No doubt he would do as he
said.She dwelt, in imagination, upon the possibilities of a new and
fascinating existence.She
would go to Washington--that far-off place.And her father and
mother--they would not need to work so hard any more.And Bass,
and Martha--she fairly glowed as she recounted to herself the
many ways in which she could help them all.A block away she waited for Brander, who accompanied her to her own
gate, and waited while she made a cautious reconnaissance.She slipped
up the steps and tried the door.She paused a moment to
indicate to her lover that she was safe, and entered.She slipped to her own room and heard Veronica breathing.She
went quietly to where Bass slept with George.He was in bed, stretched
out as if asleep.When she entered he asked, "Is that you,
Jennie?""Have you seen papa and mamma?""I went to see Senator Brander for you."They didn't say why they let me out.""Don't tell any one," she pleaded."I don't want any one to know.But he was curious as to what the
ex-Senator thought, what he had done, and how she had appealed to him.She explained briefly, then she heard her mother come to the door."I couldn't help it, ma," she replied."He wanted to talk to me," she answered evasively.Her mother looked at her nervously, wanly."I have been so afraid, oh, so afraid.Your father went to your
room, but I said you were asleep.He locked the front door, but I
opened it again.When Bass came in he wanted to call you, but I
persuaded him to wait until morning."Again she looked wistfully at her daughter."I'm all right, mamma," said Jennie encouragingly."I'll tell you
all about it to-morrow.He thought maybe they just let him go because he
couldn't pay the fine."Jennie laid her hand lovingly on her mother's shoulder.She was already years older in thought and act.She felt as though
she must help her mother now as well as herself.The days which followed were ones of dreamy uncertainty to Jennie.She went over in her mind these dramatic events time and time and time
and again.It was not such a difficult matter to tell her mother that
the Senator had talked again of marriage, that he proposed to come and
get her after his next trip to Washington, that he had given her a
hundred dollars and intended to give her more, but of that other
matter--the one all-important thing, she could not bring herself
to speak.The balance of the money that he had
promised her arrived by messenger the following day, four hundred
dollars in bills, with the admonition that she should put it in a
local bank.The ex-Senator explained that he was already on his way to
Washington, but that he would come back or send for her."Keep a stout
heart," he wrote."There are better days in store for you."Brander was gone, and Jennie's fate was really in the balance.But
her mind still retained all of the heart-innocence, and
unsophistication of her youth; a certain gentle wistfulness was the
only outward change in her demeanor.There was the mirage of a distant country and wondrous scenes looming
up in her mind.She had a little fortune in the bank, more than she
had ever dreamed of, with which to help her mother.There were
natural, girlish anticipations of good still holding over, which made
her less apprehensive than she could otherwise possibly have been.All
nature, life, possibility was in the balance.It might turn good, or
ill, but with so inexperienced a soul it would not be entirely evil
until it was so.How a mind under such uncertain circumstances could retain so
comparatively placid a vein is one of those marvels which find their
explanation in the inherent trustfulness of the spirit of youth.It is
not often that the minds of men retain the perceptions of their
younger days.The marvel is not that one should thus retain, but that
any should ever lose them Go the world over, and after you have put
away the wonder and tenderness of youth what is there left?The few
sprigs of green that sometimes invade the barrenness of your
materialism, the few glimpses of summer which flash past the eye of
the wintry soul, the half hours off during the long tedium of
burrowing, these reveal to the hardened earth-seeker the universe
which the youthful mind has with it always.No fear and no favor; the
open fields and the light upon the hills; morning, noon, night; stars,
the bird-calls, the water's purl--these are the natural
inheritance of the mind of the child.Men call it poetic, those who
are hardened fanciful.In the days of their youth it was natural, but
the receptiveness of youth has departed, and they cannot see.How this worked out in her personal actions was to be seen only in
a slightly accentuated wistfulness, a touch of which was in every
task.Sometimes she would wonder that no letter came, but at the same
time she would recall the fact that he had specified a few weeks, and
hence the six that actually elapsed did not seem so long.In the meanwhile the distinguished ex-Senator had gone
light-heartedly to his conference with the President, he had joined in
a pleasant round of social calls, and he was about to pay a short
country visit to some friends in Maryland, when he was seized with a
slight attack of fever, which confined him to his room for a few days.He felt a little irritated that he should be laid up just at this
time, but never suspected that there was anything serious in his
indisposition.Then the doctor discovered that he was suffering from a
virulent form of typhoid, the ravages of which took away his senses
for a time and left him very weak.He was thought to be convalescing,
however, when just six weeks after he had last parted with Jennie, he
was seized with a sudden attack of heart failure and never regained
consciousness.Jennie remained blissfully ignorant of his illness and
did not even see the heavy-typed headlines of the announcement of his
death until Bass came home that evening."Look here, Jennie," he said excitedly, "Brander's dead!"He held up the newspaper, on the first column of Which was printed
in heavy block type:

DEATH OF EX-SENATOR BRANDER

Sudden Passing of Ohio's Distinguished Son.Succumbs to Heart Failure
at the Arlington, in Washington.Recent attack of typhoid, from which he was thought to be recovering,
proves fatal.Jennie looked at it in blank amazement."There it is in the paper," returned Bass, his tone being that of
one who is imparting a very interesting piece of news."He died at ten
o'clock this morning."CHAPTER IX


Jennie took the paper with but ill-concealed trembling and went
into the adjoining room.There she stood by the front window and
looked at it again, a sickening sensation of dread holding her as
though in a trance."He is dead," was all that her mind could formulate for the time,
and as she stood there the voice of Bass recounting the fact to
Gerhardt in the adjoining room sounded in her ears."Yes, he is dead,"
she heard him say; and once again she tried to get some conception of
what it meant to her.She had heard Bass's
announcement and had seen Jennie leave the room, but her trouble with
Gerhardt over the Senator had caused her to be careful of any display
of emotion.No conception of the real state of affairs ever having
crossed her mind, she was only interested in seeing how Jennie would
take this sudden annihilation of her hopes."To think that he
should have to die just when he was going to do so much for
you--for us all."She paused, expecting some word of agreement, but Jennie remained
unwontedly dumb."I wouldn't feel badly," continued Mrs.He meant to do a good deal, but you mustn't think of that now.It's all over, and it can't be helped, you know."She paused again, and still Jennie remained motionless and mute.Gerhardt, seeing how useless her words were, concluded that
Jennie wished to be alone, and she went away.Still Jennie stood there, and now, as the real significance of the
news began to formulate itself into consecutive thought, she began to
realize the wretchedness of her position, its helplessness.She went
into her bedroom and sat down upon the side of the bed, from which
position she saw a very pale, distraught face staring at her from out
of the small mirror.She looked at it uncertainly; could that really
be her own countenance?"I'll have to go away," she thought, and
began, with the courage of despair, to wonder what refuge would be
open to her.In the mean time the evening meal was announced, and, to maintain
appearances, she went out and joined the family; the naturalness of
her part was very difficult to sustain.Gerhardt observed her subdued
condition without guessing the depth of emotion which it covered.Bass
was too much interested in his own affairs to pay particular attention
to anybody.During the days that followed Jennie pondered over the difficulties
of her position and wondered what she should do.Money she had, it was
true; but no friends, no experience, no place to go.She began to feel unaccountable sinkings of
spirit, nameless and formless fears seemed to surround and haunt her.Once when she arose in the morning she felt an uncontrollable desire
to cry, and frequently thereafter this feeling would seize upon her at
the most inopportune times.Gerhardt began to note her moods, and
one afternoon she resolved to question her daughter."Now you must tell me what's the matter with you," she said
quietly."Jennie, you must tell your mother everything."Jennie, to whom confession had seemed impossible, under the
sympathetic persistence of her mother broke down at last and made the
fatal confession.Gerhardt stood there, too dumb with misery to
give vent to a word.she said at last, a great wave of self-accusation sweeping
over her, "it is all my fault.After a time she went back to the washing she had to do, and stood
over her tub rubbing and crying.The tears ran down her cheeks and
dropped into the suds.Once in a while she stopped and tried to dry
her eyes with her apron, but they soon filled again.Now that the first shock had passed, there came the vivid
consciousness of ever-present danger.What would Gerhardt do if he
learned the truth?He had often said that if ever one of his daughters
should act like some of those he knew he would turn her out of doors."I'm so afraid of your father," Mrs.Gerhardt often said to Jennie
in this intermediate period."I don't know what he'll say.""Perhaps I'd better go away," suggested her daughter."No," she said; "he needn't know just yet.But in her
heart of hearts she knew that the evil day could not be long
postponed.One day, when her own suspense had reached such a pitch that it
could no longer be endured, Mrs.Gerhardt sent Jennie away with the
children, hoping to be able to tell her husband before they returned.All the morning she fidgeted about, dreading the opportune moment and
letting him retire to his slumber without speaking.When afternoon
came she did not go out to work, because she could not leave with her
painful duty unfulfilled.Gerhardt arose at four, and still she
hesitated, knowing full well that Jennie would soon return and that
the specially prepared occasion would then be lost.It is almost
certain that she would not have had the courage to say anything if he
himself had not brought up the subject of Jennie's appearance."She doesn't look well," he said."There seems to be something the
matter with her."Gerhardt, visibly struggling with her fears, and
moved to make an end of it at any cost, "Jennie is in trouble.She--"

Gerhardt, who had unscrewed a door-lock and was trying to mend it,
looked up sharply from his work.Gerhardt had her apron in her hands at the time, her nervous
tendency to roll it coming upon her.She tried to summon sufficient
courage to explain, but fear mastered her completely; she lifted the
apron to her eyes and began to cry.He was a man with the Calvin type
of face, rather spare, with skin sallow and discolored as the result
of age and work in the wind and rain.When he was surprised or angry
sparks of light glittered in his eyes.He frequently pushed his hair
back when he was troubled, and almost invariably walked the floor;
just now he looked alert and dangerous.he inquired in German, his voice straining
to a hard note."In trouble--has some one--" He paused and
flung his hand upward.Gerhardt, frightened, and yet
following her own train of thought, "that anything like that would
happen to her.she concluded, "to think
he should ruin Jennie."shouted Gerhardt, giving way to a fury of feeling, "I
thought so!That comes of letting her go
running around at nights, buggy-riding, walking the streets.God in heaven!--"

He broke from his dramatic attitude and struck out in a fierce
stride across the narrow chamber, turning like a caged animal.So he has ruined her, has
he?"Suddenly he stopped like an image jerked by a string.He was
directly in front of Mrs.Gerhardt, who had retired to the table at
the side of the wall, and was standing there pale with fear.he shouted, as if this fact had now first
occurred to him.He put both hands to his temples, as if he feared his brain would
give way, and stood looking at her, the mocking irony of the situation
seeming to burn in his brain like fire.Gerhardt, fearing for the reason of
the man, shrank still farther away, her wits taken up rather with the
tragedy of the figure he presented than with the actual substance of
his woe."He intended to marry her," she pleaded nervously."He would have
married her if he had not died."shouted Gerhardt, coming out of his trance at the
sound of her voice.That's a fine thing to talk about
now.May his soul burn in hell--the dog!Ah, God, I hope--I hope--If I were not a Christian--" He clenched
his hands, the awfulness of his passion shaking him like a leaf.Gerhardt burst into tears, and her husband turned away, his
own feelings far too intense for him to have any sympathy with her.He
walked to and fro, his heavy step shaking the kitchen floor.After a
time he came back, a new phase of the dread calamity having offered
itself to his mind.he demanded

"I don't know," returned Mrs.Gerhardt, too terror-stricken to tell
the truth."I only found it out the other day."It is your fault that she is where she is.If you had
let me have my way there would have been no cause for our trouble
to-night."A fine ending," he went on to himself.My boy gets
into jail; my daughter walks the streets and gets herself talked
about; the neighbors come to me with open remarks about my children;
and now this scoundrel ruins her.By the God in heaven, I don't know
what has got into my children!"I don't know how it is," he went on, unconsciously commiserating
himself.Every night I pray that the Lord will let me
do right, but it is no use.My hands--look
at them--are rough with work.All my life I have tried to be an
honest man.Now--now--" His voice broke, and it seemed for a
moment as if he would give way to tears.Suddenly he turned on his
wife, the major passion of anger possessing him."You are the cause of this," he exclaimed.If you had done as I told you to do this would not have happened.She has become a
street-walker, that's what she has become.She has set herself right
to go to hell.He made as if to go off to his little bedroom, but he had no sooner
reached the door than he came back."She shall not stay
under my roof!I will not let her enter my door
again.I will show her whether she will disgrace me or not!""You mustn't turn her out on the streets to-night," pleaded Mrs.We will see how the
world treats her."He walked out of the room, inflexible resolution
fixed upon his rugged features.Gerhardt was tearfully going about the
duty of getting supper, Jennie returned.Her mother started when she
heard the door open, for now she knew the storm would burst afresh."You shall not stay
another hour in my house.I don't want to see you any more.Jennie stood before him, pale, trembling a little, and silent.The
children she had brought home with her crowded about in frightened
amazement.Veronica and Martha, who loved her dearly, began to
cry."She shall get out," reiterated Gerhardt."I don't want her under
my roof.If she wants to be a street-walker, let her be one, but she
shall not stay here.Pack your things," he added, staring at her.Jennie had no word to say, but the children cried loudly.He drove them all out and followed stubbornly himself.She gathered up her few little
belongings and began, with tears, to put them into a valise her mother
brought her.The little girlish trinkets that she had accumulated from
time to time she did not take.She saw them, but thought of her
younger sisters, and let them stay.Martha and Veronica would have
assisted her, but their father forbade them to go.At six o'clock Bass came in, and seeing the nervous assembly in the
kitchen, inquired what the trouble was.Gerhardt looked at him grimly, but did not answer."What are you all sitting
around for?""He is driving Jennie away," whispered Mrs.asked Bass, opening his eyes in astonishment."I shall tell you what for," broke in Gerhardt, still speaking in
German."Because she's a street-walker, that's what for.She goes and
gets herself ruined by a man thirty years older than she is, a man old
enough to be her father.Bass looked about him, and the children opened their eyes.All felt
clearly that something terrible had happened, even the little ones."What do you want to send her out to-night for?""This
is no time to send a girl out on the streets."He oughtn't to do that," put in the mother.Bass looked around, but did nothing until Mrs.Gerhardt motioned
him toward the front door when her husband was not looking.Gerhardt dared to leave her work and
follow.The children stayed awhile, but, one by one, even they slipped
away, leaving Gerhardt alone.When he thought that time enough had
elapsed he arose.In the interval Jennie had been hastily coached by her mother.Jennie should go to a private boarding-house somewhere, and send
back her address.Bass should not accompany her, but she should wait a
little way up the street, and he would follow.When her father was
away the mother might get to see her, or Jennie could come home.All
else must be postponed until they could meet again.While the discussion was still going on, Gerhardt came in.Gerhardt, with her first and only note of
defiance.Bass said, "What's the hurry?"But Gerhardt frowned too mightily
for him to venture on any further remonstrance.Jennie entered, wearing her one good dress and carrying her valise.There was fear in her eyes, for she was passing through a fiery
ordeal, but she had become a woman.The strength of love was with her,
the support of patience and the ruling sweetness of sacrifice.Silently she kissed her mother, while tears fell fast.Then she
turned, and the door closed upon her as she went forth to a new
life.CHAPTER X


The world into which Jennie was thus unduly thrust forth was that
in which virtue has always vainly struggled since time immemorial; for
virtue is the wishing well and the doing well unto others.Virtue is
that quality of generosity which offers itself willingly for another's
service, and, being this, it is held by society to be nearly
worthless.Sell yourself cheaply and you shall be used lightly and
trampled under foot.Hold yourself dearly, however unworthily, and you
will be respected.Society, in the mass, lacks woefully in the matter
of discrimination.Its one
test that of self-preservation.Only in rare instances and with rare individuals
does there seem to be any guiding light from within.Jennie had not sought to hold herself dear.Innate feeling in her
made for self-sacrifice.She could not be readily corrupted by the
world's selfish lessons on how to preserve oneself from the evil to
come.It is in such supreme moments that growth is greatest.It comes as
with a vast surge, this feeling of strength and sufficiency.We may
still tremble, the fear of doing wretchedly may linger, but we grow.Flashes of inspiration come to guide the soul.When we are cast from a group or a condition we have still
the companionship of all that is.Its winds
and stars are fellows with you.Let the soul be but gentle and
receptive, and this vast truth will come home--not in set
phrases, perhaps, but as a feeling, a comfort, which, after all, is
the last essence of knowledge.Jennie had hardly turned from the door when she was overtaken by
Bass."Give me your grip," he said; and then seeing that she was dumb
with unutterable feeling, he added, "I think I know where I can get
you a room."He led the way to the southern part of the city, where they were
not known, and up to the door of an old lady whose parlor clock had
been recently purchased from the instalment firm by whom he was now
employed.She was not well off, he knew, and had a room to rent."Yes," she said, looking at Jennie."I wish you'd let my sister have it.We're moving away, and she
can't go yet."The old lady expressed her willingness, and Jennie was soon
temporarily installed."Don't worry now," said Bass, who felt rather sorry for her.Ma said I should tell you not to worry.Come up
to-morrow when he's gone."Jennie said she would, and, after giving her further oral
encouragement, he arranged with the old lady about board, and took his
leave."It's all right now," he said encouragingly as he went out.I've got to go back, but I'll come
around in the morning."He went away, and the bitter stress of it blew lightly over his
head, for he was thinking that Jennie had made a mistake.This was
shown by the manner in which he had asked her questions as they had
walked together, and that in the face of her sad and doubtful
mood."What'd you want to do that for?"and "Didn't you ever think what
you were doing?""Please don't ask me to-night," Jennie had said, which put an end
to the sharpest form of his queries.She had no excuse to offer and no
complaint to make.If any blame attached, very likely it was hers.His
own misfortune and the family's and her sacrifice were alike
forgotten.Left alone in her strange abode, Jennie gave way to her saddened
feelings.The shock and shame of being banished from her home overcame
her, and she wept.Although of a naturally long-suffering and
uncomplaining disposition, the catastrophic wind-up of all her hopes
was too much for her.What was this element in life that could seize
and overwhelm one as does a great wind?Why this sudden intrusion of
death to shatter all that had seemed most promising in life?As she thought over the past, a very clear recollection of the
details of her long relationship with Brander came back to her, and
for all her suffering she could only feel a loving affection for him.After all, he had not deliberately willed her any harm.His kindness,
his generosity--these things had been real.He had been
essentially a good man, and she was sorry--more for his sake than
for her own that his end had been so untimely.These cogitations, while not at all reassuring, at least served to
pass the night away, and the next morning Bass stopped on his way to
work to say that Mrs.Gerhardt wished her to come home that same
evening.Gerhardt would not be present, and they could talk it over.She spent the day lonesomely enough, but when night fell her spirits
brightened, and at a quarter of eight she set out.There was not much of comforting news to tell her.Gerhardt was
still in a direfully angry and outraged mood.He had already decided
to throw up his place on the following Saturday and go to Youngstown.Any place was better than Columbus after this; he could never expect
to hold up his head here again.He would go
away now, and if he succeeded in finding work the family should
follow, a decision which meant the abandoning of the little home.He
was not going to try to meet the mortgage on the house--he could
not hope to.At the end of the week Gerhardt took his leave, Jennie returned
home, and for a time at least there was a restoration of the old
order, a condition which, of course, could not endure.Jennie's trouble and its possible consequences weighed
upon him disagreeably.If they should all move away to some larger city it
would be much better.He pondered over the situation, and hearing that a manufacturing
boom was on in Cleveland, he thought it might be wise to try his luck
there.If Gerhardt still
worked on in Youngstown, as he was now doing, and the family came to
Cleveland, it would save Jennie from being turned out in the
streets.Bass waited a little while before making up his mind, but finally
announced his purpose."I believe I'll go up to Cleveland," he said to his mother one
evening as she was getting supper.She was rather afraid
that Bass would desert her."I think I can get work there," he returned."We oughtn't to stay
in this darned old town.""Don't swear," she returned reprovingly."Oh, I know," he said, "but it's enough to make any one swear.We've never had anything but rotten luck here.I'm going to go, and
maybe if I get anything we can all move.We'd be better off if we'd
get some place where people don't know us.Gerhardt listened with a strong hope for a betterment of their
miserable life creeping into her heart.If
he would go and get work, and come to her rescue, as a strong bright
young son might, what a thing it would be!They were in the rapids of
a life which was moving toward a dreadful calamity."Do you think you could get something to do?""I've never looked for a place yet that I
didn't get it.Other fellows have gone up there and done all right.He shoved his hands into his pockets and looked out the window."Do you think you could get along until I try my hand up there?""Papa's at work now and we have
some money that, that--" she hesitated, to name the source, so
ashamed was she of their predicament."Yes, I know," said Bass, grimly."We won't have to pay any rent here before fall and then we'll have
to give it up anyhow," she added.She was referring to the mortgage on the house, which fell due the
next September and which unquestionably could not be met."If we could
move away from here before then, I guess we could get along.""I'll do it," said Bass determinedly.Accordingly, he threw up his place at the end of the month, and the
day after he left for Cleveland.CHAPTER XI


The incidents of the days that followed, relating as they did
peculiarly to Jennie, were of an order which the morality of our day
has agreed to taboo.Certain processes of the all-mother, the great artificing wisdom of
the power that works and weaves in silence and in darkness, when
viewed in the light of the established opinion of some of the little
individuals created by it, are considered very vile.We turn our faces
away from the creation of life as if that were the last thing that man
should dare to interest himself in, openly.It is curious that a feeling of this sort should spring up in a
world whose very essence is generative, the vast process dual, and
where wind, water, soil, and light alike minister to the fruition of
that which is all that we are.Although the whole earth, not we alone,
is moved by passions hymeneal, and everything terrestrial has come
into being by the one common road, yet there is that ridiculous
tendency to close the eyes and turn away the head as if there were
something unclean in nature itself."Conceived in iniquity and born in
sin," is the unnatural interpretation put upon the process by the
extreme religionist, and the world, by its silence, gives assent to a
judgment so marvelously warped.Surely there is something radically wrong in this attitude.The
teachings of philosophy and the deductions of biology should find more
practical application in the daily reasoning of man.No process is
vile, no condition is unnatural.The accidental variation from a given
social practice does not necessarily entail sin.No poor little
earthling, caught in the enormous grip of chance, and so swerved from
the established customs of men, could possibly be guilty of that depth
of vileness which the attitude of the world would seem to predicate so
inevitably.Jennie was now to witness the unjust interpretation of that wonder
of nature, which, but for Brander's death, might have been consecrated
and hallowed as one of the ideal functions of life.Although herself
unable to distinguish the separateness of this from every other normal
process of life, yet was she made to feel, by the actions of all about
her, that degradation was her portion and sin the foundation as well
as the condition of her state.Almost, not quite, it was sought to
extinguish the affection, the consideration, the care which,
afterward, the world would demand of her, for her child.Almost, not
quite, was the budding and essential love looked upon as evil.Although her punishment was neither the gibbet nor the jail of a few
hundred years before, yet the ignorance and immobility of the human
beings about her made it impossible for them to see anything in her
present condition but a vile and premeditated infraction of the social
code, the punishment of which was ostracism.All she could do now was
to shun the scornful gaze of men, and to bear in silence the great
change that was coming upon her.Strangely enough, she felt no useless
remorse, no vain regrets.Her heart was pure, and she was conscious
that it was filled with peace.Sorrow there was, it is true, but only
a mellow phase of it, a vague uncertainty and wonder, which would
sometimes cause her eyes to fill with tears.You have heard the wood-dove calling in the lone stillness of the
summertime; you have found the unheeded brooklet singing and babbling
where no ear comes to hear.Under dead leaves and snow-banks the
delicate arbutus unfolds its simple blossom, answering some heavenly
call for color.So, too, this other flower of womanhood.Jennie was left alone, but, like the wood-dove, she was a voice of
sweetness in the summer-time.Going about her household duties, she
was content to wait, without a murmur, the fulfilment of that process
for which, after all, she was but the sacrificial implement.When her
duties were lightest she was content to sit in quiet meditation, the
marvel of life holding her as in a trance.When she was hardest
pressed to aid her mother, she would sometimes find herself quietly
singing, the pleasure of work lifting her out of herself.Always she
was content to face the future with a serene and unfaltering courage.Nature is unkind in permitting the minor
type to bear a child at all.The larger natures in their maturity
welcome motherhood, see in it the immense possibilities of racial
fulfilment, and find joy and satisfaction in being the hand-maiden of
so immense a purpose.Jennie, a child in years, was potentially a woman physically and
mentally, but not yet come into rounded conclusions as to life and her
place in it.The great situation which had forced her into this
anomalous position was from one point of view a tribute to her
individual capacity.It proved her courage, the largeness of her
sympathy, her willingness to sacrifice for what she considered a
worthy cause.That it resulted in an unexpected consequence, which
placed upon her a larger and more complicated burden, was due to the
fact that her sense of self-protection had not been commensurate with
her emotions.There were times when the prospective coming of the
child gave her a sense of fear and confusion, because she did not know
but that the child might eventually reproach her; but there was always
that saving sense of eternal justice in life which would not permit
her to be utterly crushed.To her way of thinking, people were not
intentionally cruel.Vague thoughts of sympathy and divine goodness
permeated her soul.Life at worst or best was beautiful--had
always been so.These thoughts did not come to her all at once, but through the
months during which she watched and waited.It was a wonderful thing
to be a mother, even under these untoward conditions.She felt that
she would love this child, would be a good mother to it if life
permitted.That was the problem--what would life permit?There were many things to be done--clothes to be made; certain
provisions of hygiene and diet to be observed.One of her fears was
that Gerhardt might unexpectedly return, but he did not.The old
family doctor who had nursed the various members of the Gerhardt
family through their multitudinous ailments--Doctor
Ellwanger--was taken into consultation, and he gave sound and
practical advice.Despite his Lutheran upbringing, the practice of
medicine in a large and kindly way had led him to the conclusion that
there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our
philosophies and in our small neighborhood relationships."So it is,"
he observed to Mrs.Gerhardt when she confided to him nervously what
the trouble was.These things happen in more
places than you think.If you knew as much about life as I do, and
about your neighbors, you would not cry.She can go away somewhere afterward, and people
will never know.Why should you worry about what your neighbors think.As for Jennie, she listened to his advice with
interest and without fear.She wanted things not so much for herself
as for her child, and she was anxious to do whatever she was told.The
doctor was curious to know who the father was; when informed he lifted
his eyes."That ought to be a bright
baby."There came the final hour when the child was ushered into the
world.It was Doctor Ellwanger who presided, assisted by the mother,
who, having brought forth six herself, knew exactly what to do.There
was no difficulty, and at the first cry of the new-born infant there
awakened in Jennie a tremendous yearning toward it.It was weak and feeble--a little girl, and it
needed her care.She took it to her breast, when it had been bathed
and swaddled, with a tremendous sense of satisfaction and joy.This
was her child, her little girl.She wanted to live to be able to work
for it, and rejoiced, even in her weakness, that she was so strong.He thought two weeks
would be the outside limit of her need to stay in bed.As a matter of
fact, in ten days she was up and about, as vigorous and healthy as
ever.She had been born with strength and with that nurturing quality
which makes the ideal mother.The great crisis had passed, and now life went on much as before.The children, outside of Bass, were too young to understand fully, and
had been deceived by the story that Jennie was married to Senator
Brander, who had died.They did not know that a child was coming until
it was there.Gerhardt, for they
were ever watchful and really knew all.Jennie would never have braved
this local atmosphere except for the advice of Bass, who, having
secured a place in Cleveland some time before, had written that he
thought when she was well enough it would be advisable for the whole
family to seek a new start in Cleveland.Once away they would never hear of their present neighbors and
Jennie could find something to do.CHAPTER XII


Bass was no sooner in Cleveland than the marvel of that growing
city was sufficient to completely restore his equanimity of soul and
to stir up new illusions as to the possibility of rehabilitation for
himself and his family."If only they could come here," he thought."If only they could all get work and do right."Here was no evidence
of any of their recent troubles, no acquaintances who could suggest by
their mere presence the troubles of the past.The very turning of the corner seemed to rid one of old
times and crimes.It was as if a new world existed in every block.He soon found a place in a cigar store, and, after working a few
weeks, he began to write home the cheering ideas he had in mind.Jennie ought to come as soon as she was able, and then, if she found
something to do, the others might follow.There was plenty of work for
girls of her age.She could live in the same house with him
temporarily; or maybe they could take one of the
fifteen-dollar-a-month cottages that were for rent.There were big
general furnishing houses, where one could buy everything needful for
a small house on very easy monthly terms.His mother could come and
keep house for them.They would be in a clean, new atmosphere, unknown
and untalked about.They could start life all over again; they could
be decent, honorable, prosperous.Filled with this hope and the glamor which new scenes and new
environment invariably throw over the unsophisticated mind, he wrote a
final letter, in which he suggested that Jennie should come at once.This was when the baby was six months old.There were theaters here,
he said, and beautiful streets.Vessels from the lakes came into the
heart of the city.It was a wonderful city, and growing very fast.It
was thus that the new life appealed to him.Gerhardt, Jennie, and the
rest of the family was phenomenal.Gerhardt, long weighed upon by
the misery which Jennie's error had entailed, was for taking measures
for carrying out this plan at once.So buoyant was her natural
temperament that she was completely carried away by the glory of
Cleveland, and already saw fulfilled therein not only her own desires
for a nice home, but the prosperous advancement of her children."Of
course they could get work," she said.She had always
wanted Gerhardt to go to some large city, but he would not.Now it was
necessary, and they would go and become better off than they ever had
been.And Gerhardt did take this view of the situation.In answer to his
wife's letter he wrote that it was not advisable for him to leave his
place, but if Bass saw a way for them, it might be a good thing to go.He was the more ready to acquiesce in the plan for the simple reason
that he was half distracted with the worry of supporting the family
and of paying the debts already outstanding.Every week he laid by
five dollars out of his salary, which he sent in the form of a postal
order to Mrs.Three dollars he paid for board, and fifty
cents he kept for spending money, church dues, a little tobacco and
occasionally a glass of beer.Every week he put a dollar and a half in
a little iron bank against a rainy day.His room was a bare corner in
the topmost loft of the mill.To this he would ascend after sitting
alone on the doorstep of the mill in this lonely, foresaken
neighborhood, until nine o'clock of an evening; and here, amid the
odor of machinery wafted up from the floor below, by the light of a
single tallow candle, he would conclude his solitary day, reading his
German paper, folding his hands and thinking, kneeling by an open
window in the shadow of the night to say his prayers, and silently
stretching himself to rest.Long were the days, dreary the prospect.Still he lifted his hands in utmost faith to God, praying that his
sins might be forgiven and that he might be vouchsafed a few more
years of comfort and of happy family life.There was the
greatest longing and impatience among the children, and Mrs.Gerhardt
shared their emotions in a suppressed way.Jennie was to go first, as
Bass had suggested; later on they would all follow.When the hour came for Jennie's departure there was great
excitement in the household."How long you going to be 'fore you send for us?"was Martha's
inquiry, several times repeated."Tell Bass to hurry up," said the eager George."I want to go to Cleveland, I want to go to Cleveland," Veronica
was caught singing to herself."Listen to her," exclaimed George, sarcastically."Aw, you hush up," was her displeased rejoinder.When the final hour came, however, it required all of Jennie's
strength to go through with the farewells.Though everything was being
done in order to bring them together again under better conditions,
she could not help feeling depressed.Her little one, now six months
old, was being left behind.The great world was to her one
undiscovered bourne."You mustn't worry, Ma," she found courage enough to say.I'll write you just as soon as I get there.But when it came to bending over her baby for the last time her
courage went out like a blown lamp.Stooping over the cradle in which
the little one was resting, she looked into its face with passionate,
motherly yearning."Is it going to be a good little girl?"Then she caught it up into her arms, and hugging it closely to her
neck and bosom, she buried her face against its little body."Come now," she said, coaxingly, "you mustn't carry on so.If you're going to act
this way, you'd better not try to go at all."Jennie lifted her head, her blue eyes wet with tears, and handed
the little one to her mother."I can't help it," she said, half crying, half smiling.Quickly she kissed her mother and the children; then she hurried
out.As she went down the street with George she looked back and bravely
waved her hand.Gerhardt responded, noticing how much more like a
woman she looked.It had been necessary to invest some of her money in
new clothes to wear on the train.She had selected a neat, ready-made
suit of brown, which fitted her nicely.She wore the skirt of this
with a white shirt-waist, and a sailor hat with a white veil wound
around it in such fashion that it could be easily drawn over her face.Gerhardt followed her
lovingly with her glance; and when she disappeared from view she said
tenderly, through her own tears:

"I'm glad she looked so nice, anyhow."CHAPTER XIII


Bass met Jennie at the depot in Cleveland and talked hopefully of
the prospects."The first thing is to get work," he began, while the
jingling sounds and the changing odors which the city thrust upon her
were confusing and almost benumbing her senses.It doesn't matter what, so long as you get something.If you don't get
more than three or four dollars a week, it will pay the rent.Then,
with what George can earn, when he comes, and what Pop sends, we can
get along all right.It'll be better than being down in that hole," he
concluded."Yes," said Jennie, vaguely, her mind so hypnotized by the new
display of life about her that she could not bring it forcibly to bear
upon the topic under discussion.She was much older now, in understanding if not in years.The
ordeal through which she had so recently passed had aroused in her a
clearer conception of the responsibilities of life.Her mother was
always in her mind, her mother and the children.In particular Martha
and Veronica must have a better opportunity to do for themselves than
she had had.They should be dressed better; they ought to be kept
longer in school; they must have more companionship, more opportunity
to broaden their lives.Cleveland, like every other growing city at this time, was crowded
with those who were seeking employment.New enterprises were
constantly springing up, but those who were seeking to fulfil the
duties they provided were invariably in excess of the demand.A
stranger coming to the city might walk into a small position of almost
any kind on the very day he arrived; and he might as readily wander in
search of employment for weeks and even months.Bass suggested the
shops and department stores as a first field in which to inquire.The
factories and other avenues of employment were to be her second
choice."Don't pass a place, though," he had cautioned her, "if you think
there's any chance of getting anything to do.You don't care what you do to begin
with."In compliance with this advice, Jennie set out the very first day,
and was rewarded by some very chilly experiences.Wherever she went,
no one seemed to want any help.She applied at the stores, the
factories, the little shops that lined the outlying thoroughfares, but
was always met by a rebuff.As a last resource she turned to
housework, although she had hoped to avoid that; and, studying the
want columns, she selected four which seemed more promising than the
others.One had already been filled
when she arrived, but the lady who came to the door was so taken by
her appearance that she invited her in and questioned her as to her
ability."I wish you had come a little earlier," she said."I like you
better than I do the girl I have taken.Jennie went away, smiling at her reception.She was not quite so
youthful looking as she had been before her recent trouble, but the
thinner cheeks and the slightly deeper eyes added to the pensiveness
and delicacy of her countenance.Her
clothes, all newly cleaned and ironed before leaving home, gave her a
fresh and inviting appearance.There was growth coming to her in the
matter of height, but already in appearance and intelligence she
looked to be a young woman of twenty.Best of all, she was of that
naturally sunny disposition, which, in spite of toil and privation,
kept her always cheerful.Any one in need of a servant-girl or house
companion would have been delighted to have had her.The second place at which she applied was a large residence in
Euclid Avenue; it seemed far too imposing for anything she might have
to offer in the way of services, but having come so far she decided to
make the attempt.The servant who met her at the door directed her to
wait a few moments, and finally ushered her into the boudoir of the
mistress of the house on the second floor.Bracebridge, a prepossessing brunette of the conventionally
fashionable type, had a keen eye for feminine values and was impressed
rather favorably with Jennie.She talked with her a little while, and
finally decided to try her in the general capacity of maid."I will give you four dollars a week, and you can sleep here if you
wish," said Mrs.Jennie explained that she was living with her brother, and would
soon have her family with her."Oh, very well," replied her mistress.She wished her to remain for the day and to begin her duties at
once, and Jennie agreed.Bracebridge provided her a dainty cap
and apron, and then spent some little time in instructing her in her
duties.Her principal work would be to wait on her mistress, to brush
her hair and to help her dress.She was also to answer the bell, wait
on the table if need be, and do any other errand which her mistress
might indicate.Bracebridge seemed a little hard and formal to
her prospective servant, but for all that Jennie admired the dash and
go and the obvious executive capacity of her employer.At eight o'clock that evening Jennie was dismissed for the day.She
wondered if she could be of any use in such a household, and marveled
that she had got along as well as she had.Her mistress had set her to
cleaning her jewelry and boudoir ornaments as an opening task, and
though she had worked steadily and diligently, she had not finished by
the time she left.She hurried away to her brother's apartment,
delighted to be able to report that she had found a situation.Now they could really begin that new life which was to be so much
better and finer and sweeter than anything they had ever had
before.At Bass's suggestion Jennie wrote her mother to come at once, and a
week or so later a suitable house was found and rented.Gerhardt,
with the aid of the children, packed up the simple belongings of the
family, including a single vanload of furniture, and at the end of a
fortnight they were on their way to the new home.Gerhardt always had had a keen desire for a really comfortable
home.Solid furniture, upholstered and trimmed, a thick, soft carpet
of some warm, pleasing color, plenty of chairs, settees, pictures, a
lounge, and a piano she had wanted these nice things all her life, but
her circumstances had never been good enough for her hopes to be
realized.Some day, maybe, before she died
these things would be added to her, and she would be happy.Arrived at Cleveland, this feeling of optimism was encouraged by
the sight of Jennie's cheerful face.Bass assured her that they would
get along all right.He took them out to the house, and George was
shown the way to go back to the depot and have the freight looked
after.Gerhardt had still fifty dollars left out of the money
which Senator Brander had sent to Jennie, and with this a way of
getting a little extra furniture on the instalment plan was provided.Bass had already paid the first month's rent, and Jennie had spent her
evenings for the last few days in washing the windows and floors of
this new house and in getting it into a state of perfect cleanliness.Now, when the first night fell, they had two new mattresses and
comfortables spread upon a clean floor; a new lamp, purchased from one
of the nearby stores, a single box, borrowed by Jennie from a grocery
store, for cleaning purposes, upon which Mrs.Gerhardt could sit, and
some sausages and bread to stay them until morning.They talked and
planned for the future until nine o'clock came, when all but Jennie
and her mother retired.These two talked on, the burden of
responsibilities resting on the daughter.Gerhardt had come to
feel in a way dependent upon her.In the course of a week the entire cottage was in order, with a
half-dozen pieces of new furniture, a new carpet, and some necessary
kitchen utensils.The most disturbing thing was the need of a new
cooking-stove, the cost of which added greatly to the bill.The
younger children were entered at the public school, but it was decided
that George must find some employment.Both Jennie and her mother felt
the injustice of this keenly, but knew no way of preventing the
sacrifice."We will let him go to school next year if we can," said
Jennie.Auspiciously as the new life seemed to have begun, the closeness
with which their expenses were matching their income was an
ever-present menace.Bass, originally very generous in his
propositions, soon announced that he felt four dollars a week for his
room and board to be a sufficient contribution from himself.Jennie
gave everything she earned, and protested that she did not stand in
need of anything, so long as the baby was properly taken care of.George secured a place as an overgrown cash-boy, and brought in two
dollars and fifty cents a week, all of which, at first, he gladly
contributed.Later on he was allowed the fifty cents for himself as
being meet and just.Gerhardt, from his lonely post of labor,
contributed five dollars by mail, always arguing that a little money
ought to be saved in order that his honest debts back in Columbus
might be paid.Out of this total income of fifteen dollars a week all
of these individuals had to be fed and clothed, the rent paid, coal
purchased, and the regular monthly instalment of three dollars paid on
the outstanding furniture bill of fifty dollars.How it was done, those comfortable individuals, who frequently
discuss the social aspects of poverty, might well trouble to inform
themselves.Rent, coal, and light alone consumed the goodly sum of
twenty dollars a month; food, another unfortunately necessary item,
used up twenty-five more; clothes, instalments, dues, occasional items
of medicine and the like, were met out of the remaining eleven
dollars--how, the ardent imagination of the comfortable reader
can guess.It was done, however, and for a time the hopeful members
considered that they were doing fairly well.During this period the little family presented a picture of
honorable and patient toil, which was interesting to contemplate.Gerhardt, who worked like a servant and who received
absolutely no compensation either in clothes, amusements, or anything
else, arose in the morning while the others slept, and built the fire.Then she took up the task of getting the breakfast.Often as she moved
about noiselessly in her thin, worn slippers, cushioned with pieces of
newspaper to make them fit, she looked in on Jennie, Bass, and George,
wrapped in their heavy slumbers, and with that divine sympathy which
is born in heaven she wished that they did not need to rise so early
or to work so hard.Sometimes she would pause before touching her
beloved Jennie, gaze at her white face, so calm in sleep, and lament
that life had not dealt more kindly with her.Then she would lay her
hand gently upon her shoulder and whisper, "Jennie, Jennie," until the
weary sleeper would wake.When they returned at
night supper was waiting.Each of the children received a due share of
Mrs.The little baby was closely looked after by
her.She protested that she needed neither clothes nor shoes so long
as one of the children would run errands for her.Jennie, of all the children, fully understood her mother; she alone
strove, with the fullness of a perfect affection, to ease her
burden."Now, ma, I'll 'tend to that."These were the every-day expressions of the enduring affection that
existed between them.Always there was perfect understanding between
Jennie and her mother, and as the days passed this naturally widened
and deepened.Jennie could not bear to think of her as being always
confined to the house.Daily she thought as she worked of that humble
home where her mother was watching and waiting.How she longed to give
her those comforts which she had always craved!CHAPTER XIV


The days spent in the employ of the Bracebridge household were of a
broadening character.This great house was a school to Jennie, not
only in the matter of dress and manners, but as formulating a theory
of existence.Bracebridge and her husband were the last word in
the matter of self-sufficiency, taste in the matter of appointments,
care in the matter of dress, good form in the matter of reception,
entertainment, and the various usages of social life.Now and then,
apropos of nothing save her own mood, Mrs.Bracebridge would indicate
her philosophy of life in an epigram.If you gain anything you will have to
fight for it.""In my judgment it is silly not to take advantage of any aid which
will help you to be what you want to be."(This while applying a faint
suggestion of rouge.)They are exactly what they are capable
of being.I despise lack of taste; it is the worst crime."Most of these worldly-wise counsels were not given directly to
Jennie.She overheard them, but to her quiet and reflective mind they
had their import.Like seeds fallen upon good ground, they took root
and grew.She began to get a faint perception of hierarchies and
powers.They were not for her, perhaps, but they were in the world,
and if fortune were kind one might better one's state.She worked on,
wondering, however, just how better fortune might come to her.Who
would have her to wife knowing her history?How could she ever explain
the existence of her child?Her child, her child, the one transcendent, gripping theme of joy
and fear.If she could only do something for it--sometime,
somehow!By the closest
economy the children were clothed and kept in school, the rent paid,
and the instalments met.Once it looked as though there might be some
difficulty about the continuance of the home life, and that was when
Gerhardt wrote that he would be home for Christmas.The mill was to
close down for a short period at that time.He was naturally anxious
to see what the new life of his family at Cleveland was like.Gerhardt would have welcomed his return with unalloyed
pleasure had it not been for the fear she entertained of his creating
a scene.Jennie talked it over with her mother, and Mrs.Gerhardt in
turn spoke of it to Bass, whose advice was to brave it out."Don't worry," he said; "he won't do anything about it.I'll talk
to him if he says anything."The scene did occur, but it was not so unpleasant as Mrs.Gerhardt came home during the afternoon, while Bass,
Jennie, and George were at work.Two of the younger children went to
the train to meet him.Gerhardt greeted him
affectionately, but she trembled for the discovery which was sure to
come.Gerhardt opened the front bedroom
door only a few minutes after he arrived.On the white counterpane of
the bed was a pretty child, sleeping.He could not but know on the
instant whose it was, but he pretended ignorance."It's Jennie's," said Mrs."Not so very long ago," answered the mother, nervously."I guess she is here, too," he declared, contemptuously, refusing
to pronounce her name, a fact which he had already anticipated."She's working in a family," returned his wife in a pleading tone.Gerhardt had received a light since he had been away.Certain
inexplicable thoughts and feelings had come to him in his religious
meditations.In his prayers he had admitted to the All-seeing that he
might have done differently by his daughter.Yet he could not make up
his mind how to treat her for the future.She had committed a great
sin; it was impossible to get away from that.When Jennie came home that night a meeting was unavoidable.Gerhardt saw her coming, and pretended to be deeply engaged in a
newspaper.Gerhardt, who had begged him not to ignore Jennie
entirely, trembled for fear he would say or do something which would
hurt her feelings."She is coming now," she said, crossing to the door of the front
room, where he was sitting; but Gerhardt refused to look up."Speak to
her, anyhow," was her last appeal before the door opened; but he made
no reply.When Jennie came in her mother whispered, "He is in the front
room."Jennie paled, put her thumb to her lip and stood irresolute, not
knowing how to meet the situation.Jennie paused as she realized from her mother's face and nod that
Gerhardt knew of the child's existence.Jennie finally went to the door, and, seeing her father, his brow
wrinkled as if in serious but not unkindly thought, she hesitated, but
made her way forward."Papa," she said, unable to formulate a definite sentence.Gerhardt looked up, his grayish-brown eyes a study under their
heavy sandy lashes.At the sight of his daughter he weakened
internally; but with the self-adjusted armor of resolve about him he
showed no sign of pleasure at seeing her.All the forces of his
conventional understanding of morality and his naturally sympathetic
and fatherly disposition were battling within him, but, as in so many
cases where the average mind is concerned, convention was temporarily
the victor."Won't you forgive me, Papa?"She hesitated a moment, and then stepped forward, for what purpose
he well understood."There," he said, pushing her gently away, as her lips barely
touched his grizzled cheek.When Jennie went out into the kitchen after this very trying ordeal
she lifted her eyes to her waiting mother and tried to make it seem as
though all had been well, but her emotional disposition got the better
of her.her mother was about to ask; but the words
were only half out of her mouth before her daughter sank down into one
of the chairs close to the kitchen table and, laying her head on her
arm, burst forth into soft, convulsive, inaudible sobs.It was some time before Jennie recovered herself sufficiently to
answer."I wouldn't feel bad," she said.CHAPTER XV


The return of Gerhardt brought forward the child question in all
its bearings.He could not help considering it from the standpoint of
a grandparent, particularly since it was a human being possessed of a
soul."No, not yet," said his wife, who had not forgotten this duty, but
had been uncertain whether the little one would be welcome in the
faith."No, of course not," sneered Gerhardt, whose opinion of his wife's
religious devotion was not any too great.He thought it over a few moments, and felt that this evil should be
corrected at once."Why don't she take it and have
it baptized?"Gerhardt reminded him that some one would have to stand
godfather to the child, and there was no way to have the ceremony
performed without confessing the fact that it was without a legitimate
father.Gerhardt listened to this, and it quieted him for a few moments,
but his religion was something which he could not see put in the
background by any such difficulty.How would the Lord look upon
quibbling like this?It was not Christian, and it was his duty to
attend to the matter.It must be taken, forthwith, to the church,
Jennie, himself, and his wife accompanying it as sponsors; or, if he
did not choose to condescend thus far to his daughter, he must see
that it was baptized when she was not present.He brooded over this
difficulty, and finally decided that the ceremony should take place on
one of these week-days between Christmas and New Year's, when Jennie
would be at her work.This proposal he broached to his wife, and,
receiving her approval, he made his next announcement."It has no
name," he said.Jennie and her mother had talked over this very matter, and Jennie
had expressed a preference for Vesta.Now her mother made bold to
suggest it as her own choice.Secretly he had settled the
question in his own mind.He had a name in store, left over from the
halcyon period of his youth, and never opportunely available in the
case of his own children--Wilhelmina.Of course he had no idea of
unbending in the least toward his small granddaughter.He merely liked
the name, and the child ought to be grateful to get it.With a
far-off, gingery air he brought forward this first offering upon the
altar of natural affection, for offering it was, after all."That is nice," he said, forgetting his indifference."But how
would Wilhelmina do?"Gerhardt did not dare cross him when he was thus unconsciously
weakening."We might give her both names," she compromised."It makes no difference to me," he replied, drawing back into the
shell of opposition from which he had been inadvertently drawn.Jennie heard of this with pleasure, for she was anxious that the
child should have every advantage, religious or otherwise, that it was
possible to obtain.She took great pains to starch and iron the
clothes it was to wear on the appointed day.Gerhardt sought out the minister of the nearest Lutheran church, a
round-headed, thick-set theologian of the most formal type, to whom he
stated his errand."Yes," said Gerhardt, "her father is not here.""So," replied the minister, looking at him curiously.Gerhardt was not to be disturbed in his purpose.He explained that
he and his wife would bring her.The minister, realizing the probable
difficulty, did not question him further."The church cannot refuse to baptize her so long as you, as
grandparent, are willing to stand sponsor for her," he said.Gerhardt came away, hurt by the shadow of disgrace in which he felt
himself involved, but satisfied that he had done his duty.Now he
would take the child and have it baptized, and when that was over his
present responsibility would cease.When it came to the hour of the baptism, however, he found that
another influence was working to guide him into greater interest and
responsibility.The stern religion with which he was enraptured, its
insistence upon a higher law, was there, and he heard again the
precepts which had helped to bind him to his own children."Is it your intention to educate this child in the knowledge and
love of the gospel?"asked the black-gowned minister, as they stood
before him in the silent little church whither they had brought the
infant; he was reading from the form provided for such occasions."Do you engage to use all necessary care and diligence, by
prayerful instruction, admonition, example, and discipline that this
child may renounce and avoid everything that is evil and that she may
keep God's will and commandments as declared in His sacred word?"A thought flashed through Gerhardt's mind as the words were uttered
of how it had fared with his own children.They, too, had been thus
sponsored.They too, had heard his solemn pledge to care for their
spiritual welfare."We do," repeated Gerhardt and his wife weakly."Do you now dedicate this child by the rite of baptism unto the
Lord, who brought it?""And, finally, if you can conscientiously declare before God that
the faith to which you have assented is your faith, and that the
solemn promises you have made are the serious resolutions of your
heart, please to announce the same in the presence of God, by saying
'Yes.'""I baptize thee, Wilhelmina Vesta," concluded the minister,
stretching out his hand over her, "in the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Ghost.Gerhardt bent his gray head and followed with humble reverence the
beautiful invocation which followed:

"Almighty and everlasting God!we adore Thee as the great Parent of
the children of men, as the Father of our spirits and the Former of
our bodies.We praise Thee for giving existence to this infant and for
preserving her until this day.We bless Thee that she is called to
virtue and glory, that she has now been dedicated to Thee, and brought
within-the pale of the Christian Church.We thank Thee that by the
Gospel of the Son she is furnished with everything necessary to her
spiritual happiness; that it supplies light for her mind and comfort
for her heart, encouragement and power to discharge her duty, and the
precious hope of mercy and immortality to sustain and make her
faithful.And we beseech Thee, O most merciful God, that this child
may be enlightened and sanctified from her early years by the Holy
Spirit, and be everlastingly saved by Thy mercy.Direct and bless Thy
servants who are intrusted with the care of her in the momentous work
of her education.Inspire them with just conception of the absolute
necessity of religious instruction and principles.Forbid that they
should ever forget that this offspring belongs to Thee, and that, if
through their criminal neglect or bad example Thy reasonable creature
be lost, Thou wilt require it at their hands.Give them a deep sense
of the divinity of her nature, of the worth of her soul, of the
dangers to which she will be exposed, of the honor and felicity to
which she is capable of ascending with Thy blessing, and of the ruin
in this world and the misery in the world to come which springs from
wicked passion and conduct.Give them grace to check the first risings
of forbidden inclinations in her breast, to be her defense against the
temptations incident to childhood and youth, and, as she grows up, to
enlarge her understanding and to lead her to an acquaintance with Thee
and with Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.Give them grace to
cultivate in her heart a supreme reverence and love for Thee, a
grateful attachment to the Gospel of Thy Son, her Saviour, a due
regard for all its ordinances and institutions, a temper of kindness
and goodwill to all mankind, and an invincible love of sincerity and
truth.Help them to watch continually over her with tender solicitude,
to be studious, that by their conversation and deportment her heart
may not be corrupted, and at all times to set before her such an
example that she may safely tread in their footsteps.If it please
Thee to prolong her days on earth, grant that she may prove an honor
and a comfort to her parents and friends, be useful in the world, and
find in Thy Providence an unfailing defense and support.Whether she
live, let her live to Thee; or whether she die, let her die to Thee.And, at the great day of account, may she and her parents meet each
other with rapture and rejoice together in Thy redeeming love, through
Jesus Christ, forever and ever, Amen."As this solemn admonition was read a feeling of obligation
descended upon the grandfather of this little outcast; a feeling that
he was bound to give the tiny creature lying on his wife's arm the
care and attention which God in His sacrament had commanded.He bowed
his head in utmost reverence, and when the service was concluded and
they left the silent church he was without words to express his
feelings.God was a person, a
dominant reality.Religion was not a thing of mere words or of
interesting ideas to be listened to on Sunday, but a strong, vital
expression of the Divine Will handed down from a time when men were in
personal contact with God.Its fulfilment was a matter of joy and
salvation with him, the one consolation of a creature sent to wander
in a vale whose explanation was not here but in heaven.Slowly
Gerhardt walked on, and as he brooded on the words and the duties
which the sacrament involved the shade of lingering disgust that had
possessed him when he had taken the child to church disappeared and a
feeling of natural affection took its place.However much the daughter
had sinned, the infant was not to blame.It was a helpless, puling,
tender thing, demanding his sympathy and his love.Gerhardt felt his
heart go out to the little child, and yet he could not yield his
position all in a moment."That is a nice man," he said of the minister to his wife as they
walked along, rapidly softening in his conception of his duty."It's a good-sized little church," he continued.Gerhardt looked around him, at the street, the houses, the show of
brisk life on this sunshiny, winter's day, and then finally at the
child that his wife was carrying."She must be heavy," he said, in his characteristic German.Gerhardt, who was rather weary, did not refuse.he said, as he looked at her and then fixed her
comfortably upon his shoulder."Let us hope she proves worthy of all
that has been done to-day."Gerhardt listened, and the meaning in his voice interpreted
itself plainly enough.The presence of the child in the house might be
the cause of recurring spells of depression and unkind words, but
there would be another and greater influence restraining him.There
would always be her soul to consider.He would never again be utterly
unconscious of her soul.CHAPTER XVI


During the remainder of Gerhardt's stay he was shy in Jennie's
presence and endeavored to act as though he were unconscious of her
existence.When the time came for parting he even went away without
bidding her good-by, telling his wife she might do that for him; but
after he was actually on his way back to Youngstown he regretted the
omission."I might have bade her good-by," he thought to himself as
the train rumbled heavily along.For the time being the affairs of the Gerhardt family drifted.Sebastian fixed
himself firmly in his clerkship in the cigar store.George was
promoted to the noble sum of three dollars, and then three-fifty.It
was a narrow, humdrum life the family led.Coal, groceries, shoes, and
clothing were the uppermost topics of their conversation; every one
felt the stress and strain of trying to make ends meet.That which worried Jennie most, and there were many things which
weighed upon her sensitive soul, was the outcome of her own
life--not so much for herself as for her baby and the family.She
could not really see where she fitted in."How was she to dispose of Vesta in the
event of a new love affair?"She was young, good-looking, and men were inclined to flirt with her,
or rather to attempt it.The Bracebridges entertained many masculine
guests, and some of them had made unpleasant overtures to her."My dear, you're a very pretty girl," said one old rake of
fifty-odd when she knocked at his door one morning to give him a
message from his hostess."I beg your pardon," she said, confusedly, and colored.I'd
like to talk to you some time."He attempted to chuck her under the chin, but Jennie hurried away.She would have reported the matter to her mistress but a nervous shame
deterred her.Could
it be because there was something innately bad about her, an inward
corruption that attracted its like?It is a curious characteristic of the non-defensive disposition
that it is like a honey-jar to flies.Nothing is brought to it and
much is taken away.Around a soft, yielding, unselfish disposition men
swarm naturally.They sense this generosity, this non-protective
attitude from afar.A girl like Jennie is like a comfortable fire to
the average masculine mind; they gravitate to it, seek its sympathy,
yearn to possess it.Hence she was annoyed by many unwelcome
attentions.One day there arrived from Cincinnati a certain Lester Kane, the
son of a wholesale carriage builder of great trade distinction in that
city and elsewhere throughout the country, who was wont to visit this
house frequently in a social way.Bracebridge
more than of her husband, for the former had been raised in Cincinnati
and as a girl had visited at his father's house.She knew his mother,
his brother and sisters and to all intents and purposes socially had
always been considered one of the family."Lester's coming to-morrow, Henry," Jennie heard Mrs."I had a wire from him this noon.I'm going to give him the big east front room up-stairs.Be sociable
and pay him some attention."I know it," said her husband calmly.He's the
biggest one in that family."I know; but he's so nice.I do think he's one of the nicest men I
ever knew."Don't I always do pretty well by your
people?""Oh, I don't know about that," he replied, dryly.When this notable person arrived Jennie was prepared to see some
one of more than ordinary importance, and she was not disappointed.There came into the reception-hall to greet her mistress a man of
perhaps thirty-six years of age, above the medium in height,
clear-eyed, firm-jawed, athletic, direct, and vigorous.He had a deep,
resonant voice that carried clearly everywhere; people somehow used to
stop and listen whether they knew him or not.He was simple and abrupt
in his speech."Oh, there you are," he began.He asked his questions forcefully, whole-heartedly, and his hostess
answered with an equal warmth."I'm glad to see you, Lester," she
said."George will take your things up-stairs.He followed her up the stairs, and Jennie, who had been standing at
the head of the stairs listening, felt the magnetic charm of his
personality.It seemed, why she could hardly say, that a real
personage had arrived.The attitude of her
mistress was much more complaisant.Everybody seemed to feel that
something must be done for this man.Jennie went about her work, but the impression persisted; his name
ran in her mind.She looked
at him now and then on the sly, and felt, for the first time in her
life, an interest in a man on his own account.He was so big, so
handsome, so forceful.At the same
time she felt a little dread of him.Once she caught him looking at
her with a steady, incisive stare.She quailed inwardly, and took the
first opportunity to get out of his presence.Another time he tried to
address a few remarks to her, but she pretended that her duties called
her away.She knew that often his eyes were on her when her back was
turned, and it made her nervous.She wanted to run away from him,
although there was no very definite reason why she should do so.As a matter of fact, this man, so superior to Jennie in wealth,
education, and social position, felt an instinctive interest in her
unusual personality.Like the others, he was attracted by the peculiar
softness of her disposition and her pre-eminent femininity.There was
that about her which suggested the luxury of love.He felt as if
somehow she could be reached why, he could not have said.She did not
bear any outward marks of her previous experience.There were no
evidences of coquetry about her, but still he "felt that he might."He
was inclined to make the venture on his first visit, but business
called him away; he left after four days and was absent from Cleveland
for three weeks.Jennie thought he was gone for good, and she
experienced a queer sense of relief as well as of regret.He came apparently unexpectedly, explaining to
Mrs.Bracebridge that business interests again demanded his presence
in Cleveland.As he spoke he looked at Jennie sharply, and she felt as
if somehow his presence might also concern her a little.On this second visit she had various opportunities of seeing him,
at breakfast, where she sometimes served, at dinner, when she could
see the guests at the table from the parlor or sitting-room, and at
odd times when he came to Mrs.Bracebridge's boudoir to talk things
over."Why don't you settle down, Lester, and get married?"Jennie heard
her say to him the second day he was there."I know," he replied, "but I'm in no mood for that.I want to
browse around a little while yet."You ought to be ashamed of
yourself.He has
got all he can attend to to look after the business."She scarcely understood what she
was thinking, but this man drew her.If she had realized in what way
she would have fled his presence then and there.Now he was more insistent in his observation of her--addressed
an occasional remark to her--engaged her in brief, magnetic
conversations.She could not help answering him--he was pleasing
to her.Once he came across her in the hall on the second floor
searching in a locker for some linen.Bracebridge having gone out to do some morning shopping and the other
servants being below stairs.On this occasion he made short work of
the business.He approached her in a commanding, unhesitating, and
thoroughly determined way."I want to talk to you," he said."I--I--" she stammered, and blanched perceptibly."I live
out on Lorrie Street."he questioned, as though she were compelled to tell
him."Thirteen fourteen," she replied
mechanically.He looked into her big, soft-blue eyes with his dark, vigorous
brown ones.A flash that was hypnotic, significant, insistent passed
between them."Oh, you mustn't," she said, her fingers going nervously to her
lips."I can't see you--I--I--"

"Oh, I mustn't, mustn't I?Look here"--he took her arm and
drew her slightly closer--"you and I might as well understand
each other right now.She looked at him, her eyes wide, filled with wonder, with fear,
with a growing terror."I don't know," she gasped, her lips dry.He fixed her grimly, firmly with his eyes."I'll talk to you later," he said,
and put his lips masterfully to hers.She was horrified, stunned, like a bird in the grasp of a cat; but
through it all something tremendously vital and insistent was speaking
to her."We won't do any more of
this here, but, remember, you belong to me," he said, as he turned and
walked nonchalantly down the hall.Jennie, in sheer panic, ran to her
mistress's room and locked the door behind her.CHAPTER XVII


The shock of this sudden encounter was so great to Jennie that she
was hours in recovering herself.At first she did not understand
clearly just what had happened.Out of clear sky, as it were, this
astonishing thing had taken place.she asked herself, and yet within her own consciousness
there was an answer.Though she could not explain her own emotions,
she belonged to him temperamentally and he belonged to her.There is a fate in love and a fate in fight.This strong,
intellectual bear of a man, son of a wealthy manufacturer, stationed,
so far as material conditions were concerned, in a world immensely
superior to that in which Jennie moved, was, nevertheless,
instinctively, magnetically, and chemically drawn to this poor
serving-maid.She was his natural affinity, though he did not know
it--the one woman who answered somehow the biggest need of his
nature.Lester Kane had known all sorts of women, rich and poor, the
highly bred maidens of his own class, the daughters of the
proletariat, but he had never yet found one who seemed to combine for
him the traits of an ideal woman--sympathy, kindliness of
judgment, youth, and beauty.Yet this ideal remained fixedly seated in
the back of his brain--when the right woman appeared he intended
to take her.He had the notion that, for purposes of marriage, he
ought perhaps to find this woman on his own plane.For purposes of
temporary happiness he might take her from anywhere, leaving marriage,
of course, out of the question.He had no idea of making anything like
a serious proposal to a servant-girl.He had
never seen a servant quite like her.And she was lady-like and lovely
without appearing to know it.Why
shouldn't he try to seize her?Let us be just to Lester Kane; let us
try to understand him and his position.Not every mind is to be
estimated by the weight of a single folly; not every personality is to
be judged by the drag of a single passion.We live in an age in which
the impact of materialized forces is well-nigh irresistible; the
spiritual nature is overwhelmed by the shock.The tremendous and
complicated development of our material civilization, the
multiplicity, and variety of our social forms, the depth, subtlety,
and sophistry of our imaginative impressions, gathered, remultiplied,
and disseminated by such agencies as the railroad, the express and the
post-office, the telephone, the telegraph, the newspaper, and, in
short, the whole machinery of social intercourse--these elements
of existence combine to produce what may be termed a kaleidoscopic
glitter, a dazzling and confusing phantasmagoria of life that wearies
and stultifies the mental and moral nature.It induces a sort of
intellectual fatigue through which we see the ranks of the victims of
insomnia, melancholia, and insanity constantly recruited.Our modern
brain-pan does not seem capable as yet of receiving, sorting, and
storing the vast army of facts and impressions which present
themselves daily.We are
weighed upon by too many things.It is as if the wisdom of the
infinite were struggling to beat itself into finite and cup-big
minds.Lester Kane was the natural product of these untoward conditions.His was a naturally observing mind, Rabelaisian in its strength and
tendencies, but confused by the multiplicity of things, the vastness
of the panorama of life, the glitter of its details, the unsubstantial
nature of its forms, the uncertainty of their justification.Born a
Catholic, he was no longer a believer in the divine inspiration of
Catholicism; raised a member of the social elect, he had ceased to
accept the fetish that birth and station presuppose any innate
superiority; brought up as the heir to a comfortable fortune and
expected to marry in his own sphere, he was by no means sure that he
wanted marriage on any terms.Of course the conjugal state was an
institution.True, but other nations believed in
polygamy.There were other questions that bothered him--such
questions as the belief in a single deity or ruler of the universe,
and whether a republican, monarchial, or aristocratic form of
government were best.In short, the whole body of things material,
social, and spiritual had come under the knife of his mental surgery
and been left but half dissected.Not a
single idea of his, unless it were the need of being honest, was
finally settled.In all other things he wavered, questioned,
procrastinated, leaving to time and to the powers back of the universe
the solution of the problems that vexed him.Yes, Lester Kane was the
natural product of a combination of elements--religious,
commercial, social--modified by that pervading atmosphere of
liberty in our national life which is productive of almost uncounted
freedom of thought and action.Thirty-six years of age, and apparently
a man of vigorous, aggressive, and sound personality, he was,
nevertheless, an essentially animal-man, pleasantly veneered by
education and environment.Like the hundreds of thousands of Irishmen
who in his father's day had worked on the railroad tracks, dug in the
mines, picked and shoveled in the ditches, and carried up bricks and
mortar on the endless structures of a new land, he was strong, hairy,
axiomatic, and witty."Do you want me to come back here next year?"he had asked of
Brother Ambrose, when, in his seventeenth year, that ecclesiastical
member was about to chastise him for some school-boy misdemeanor."Your father will have to
look after that," he replied."Well, my father won't look after it," Lester returned."If you
touch me with that whip I'll take things into my own hands.I'm not
committing any punishable offenses, and I'm not going to be knocked
around any more."Words, unfortunately, did not avail in this case, but a good,
vigorous Irish-American wrestle did, in which the whip was broken and
the discipline of the school so far impaired that he was compelled to
take his clothes and leave.After that he looked his father in the eye
and told him that he was not going to school any more."I'm perfectly willing to jump in and work," he explained."There's
nothing in a classical education for me.Let me go into the office,
and I guess I'll pick up enough to carry me through."Old Archibald Kane, keen, single-minded, of unsullied commercial
honor, admired his son's determination, and did not attempt to coerce
him."Come down to the office," he said; "perhaps there is something you
can do."Entering upon a business life at the age of eighteen, Lester had
worked faithfully, rising in his father's estimation, until now he had
come to be, in a way, his personal representative.Whenever there was
a contract to be entered upon, an important move to be decided, or a
representative of the manufactory to be sent anywhere to consummate a
deal, Lester was the agent selected.His father trusted him
implicitly, and so diplomatic and earnest was he in the fulfilment of
his duties that this trust had never been impaired."Business is business," was a favorite axiom with him and the very
tone in which he pronounced the words was a reflex of his character
and personality.There were molten forces in him, flames which burst forth now and
then in spite of the fact that he was sure that he had them under
control.One of these impulses was a taste for liquor, of which he was
perfectly sure he had the upper hand.He drank but very little, he
thought, and only, in a social way, among friends; never to excess.Another weakness lay in his sensual nature; but here again he believed
that he was the master.If he chose to have irregular relations with
women, he was capable of deciding where the danger point lay.If men
were only guided by a sense of the brevity inherent in all such
relationships there would not be so many troublesome consequences
growing out of them.Finally, he flattered himself that he had a grasp
upon a right method of living, a method which was nothing more than a
quiet acceptance of social conditions as they were, tempered by a
little personal judgment as to the right and wrong of individual
conduct.Not to fuss and fume, not to cry out about anything, not to
be mawkishly sentimental; to be vigorous and sustain your personality
intact--such was his theory of life, and he was satisfied that it
was a good one.As to Jennie, his original object in approaching her had been
purely selfish.But now that he had asserted his masculine
prerogatives, and she had yielded, at least in part, he began to
realize that she was no common girl, no toy of the passing hour.There is a time in some men's lives when they unconsciously begin
to view feminine youth and beauty not so much in relation to the ideal
of happiness, but rather with regard to the social conventions by
which they are environed.they ask themselves, in speculating concerning the
possibility of taking a maiden to wife, "that I shall be compelled to
swallow the whole social code, make a covenant with society, sign a
pledge of abstinence, and give to another a life interest in all my
affairs, when I know too well that I am but taking to my arms a
variable creature like myself, whose wishes are apt to become
insistent and burdensome in proportion to the decrease of her beauty
and interest?"These are the men, who, unwilling to risk the manifold
contingencies of an authorized connection, are led to consider the
advantages of a less-binding union, a temporary companionship.They
seek to seize the happiness of life without paying the cost of their
indulgence.Later on, they think, the more definite and conventional
relationship may be established without reproach or the necessity of
radical readjustment.Lester Kane was past the youthful love period, and he knew it.The
innocence and unsophistication of younger ideals had gone.He wanted
the comfort of feminine companionship, but he was more and more
disinclined to give up his personal liberty in order to obtain it.He
would not wear the social shackles if it were possible to satisfy the
needs of his heart and nature and still remain free and unfettered.Of
course he must find the right woman, and in Jennie he believed that he
had discovered her.She appealed to him on every side; he had never
known anybody quite like her.Marriage was not only impossible but
unnecessary.He had only to say "Come" and she must obey; it was her
destiny.Lester thought the matter over calmly, dispassionately.He strolled
out to the shabby street where she lived; he looked at the humble roof
that sheltered her.Her poverty, her narrow and straitened environment
touched his heart.Ought he not to treat her generously, fairly,
honorably?Then the remembrance of her marvelous beauty swept over him
and changed his mood.No, he must possess her if he
could--to-day, quickly, as soon as possible.It was in that frame
of mind that he returned to Mrs.Bracebridge's home from his visit to
Lorrie Street.CHAPTER XVIII


Jennie was now going through the agony of one who has a varied and
complicated problem to confront.Her baby, her father, her brothers,
and sisters all rose up to confront her.What was this thing that she
was doing?Was she allowing herself to slip into another wretched,
unsanctified relationship?How was she to explain to her family about
this man?He would not marry her, that was sure, if he knew all about
her.He would not marry her, anyhow, a man of his station and
position.Yet here she was parleying with him.She pondered over the problem until evening, deciding first that it
was best to run away, but remembering painfully that she had told him
where she lived.Then she resolved that she would summon up her
courage and refuse him--tell him she couldn't, wouldn't have
anything to do with him.This last solution of the difficulty seemed
simple enough--in his absence.And she would find work where he
could not follow her up so easily.It all seemed simple enough as she
put on her things in the evening to go home.Her aggressive lover, however, was not without his own conclusion
in this matter.Since leaving Jennie he had thought concisely and to
the point.He came to the decision that he must act at once.She might
tell her family, she might tell Mrs.Bracebridge, she might leave the
city.He wanted to know more of the conditions which surrounded her,
and there was only one way to do that--talk to her.He must
persuade her to come and live with him.That soft, yielding note in her character
which had originally attracted him seemed to presage that he could win
her without much difficulty, if he wished to try.He decided to do so,
anyhow, for truly he desired her greatly.At half-past five he returned to the Bracebridge home to see if she
were still there.At six he had an opportunity to say to her,
unobserved, "I am going to walk home with you.Wait for me at the next
corner, will you?""Yes," she said, a sense of compulsion to do his bidding seizing
her.She explained to herself afterward that she ought to talk to him,
that she must tell him finally of her decision not to see him again,
and this was as good an opportunity as any.At half-past six he left
the house on a pretext--a forgotten engagement--and a little
after seven he was waiting for her in a closed carriage near the
appointed spot.He was calm, absolutely satisfied as to the result,
and curiously elated beneath a sturdy, shock-proof exterior.It was as
if he breathed some fragrant perfume, soft, grateful, entrancing.A few minutes after eight he saw Jennie coming along.The flare of
the gas-lamp was not strong, but it gave sufficient light for his eyes
to make her out.A wave of sympathy passed over him, for there was a
great appeal in her personality.He stepped out as she neared the
corner and confronted her."Come," he said, "and get in this carriage
with me.Once more that sense of dominance on his part, that power of
compulsion.She yielded, feeling all the time that she should not; he
called out to the cabman, "Anywhere for a little while."When she was
seated beside him he began at once."Listen to me, Jennie, I want you."I have to talk to you," she replied, trying to stick to her
original line of defense.he inquired, seeking to fathom her expression in the
half light."I can't go on this way," she murmured nervously.I shouldn't have done what I did
this morning."You didn't do what you did this morning," he remarked,
paradoxically, seizing on that one particular expression.And as for seeing me any more, I'm going to see you.""You don't know me, but I like you.I'm crazy about you, that's
all.she replied in an agonized voice, "I can't do
anything like that, Mr.I couldn't, even if I wanted to.But I don't want to do anything wrong.He listened to this troubled, feverish outburst with sympathy, with
even a little pity."What do you mean by you can't?""Oh, I can't tell you," she replied.But I mustn't see you any more."But you like me," he retorted.But you mustn't come near me
any more.He turned his proposition over in his mind with the solemnity of a
judge.He knew that this girl liked him--loved him really, brief
as their contact had been.And he was drawn to her, perhaps not
irrevocably, but with exceeding strength.What prevented her from
yielding, especially since she wanted to?"See here, Jennie," he replied.I don't know
what you mean by 'can't' if you want to.I'd like to have you
with me.Oh,
please don't ask me any more.The man had a keen sense of justice and fair play.Above all things
he wanted to be decent in his treatment of people.In this case he
intended to be tender and considerate, and yet he must win her."Listen to me," he said finally, still holding her hand."I may not
want you to do anything immediately.I
like you, and I can do a lot of things for you.Why not let us be good
friends now?Then we can talk the rest of this over later.""But I mustn't do anything wrong," she insisted."Oh no, no, no," she half sobbed, swept by some force beyond her
control."Well, then, why stand out against me?I love you, I tell
you--I'm crazy about you.And I would have come again and again if necessary.I
tell you I'm crazy about you.Now tell me you'll
come with me.""No, no, no," she pleaded.I
don't want to do anything wrong."Tell me, Jennie," he said, changing the subject."Don't say'sir' to me, sweet!"I'm not'mister'
to you any more.You belong to me, little girl, me.""Listen to me, Jennie," he repeated, using his favorite expression.I
haven't had a chance to know you.You've
got to come to me eventually.And I'm not going to have you working as
a lady's maid.You can't stay in that place except for a little while.And I'm going to leave you some
money, do you hear?At the word money she quailed and withdrew her hand."The families of the poor," he thought."Well, you take this from me," he insisted, drawing a purse from
his coat."And I'll see you very soon again.No, you mustn't
ask me."He insisted further, but she was firm, and finally he put the money
away."One thing is sure, Jennie, you're not going to escape me," he said
soberly."You'll have to come to me eventually.I'm not going to leave you
alone.""Oh, if you knew the trouble you're causing me.""I'm not causing you any real trouble, am I?"he exclaimed eagerly, the bare thought of
this prize escaping him heightening his passion.And he drew her close in spite of all her protests."There," he said when, after the struggle, that mystic something
between them spoke again, and she relaxed.Tears were in her eyes, but
he did not see them."I can't," she repeated, with a sob."You're not crying, little girl,
are you?""I'll not say anything more to-night.I'm leaving to-morrow, but I'll see you
again.I'll do anything
in reason to make it easy for you, but I can't, do you hear?""Here's where you get out," he said, as the carriage drew up near
the corner.He could see the evening lamp gleaming behind the Gerhardt
cottage curtains."Good-by," he said as she stepped out."Remember," he said, "this is just the beginning."Jennie stepped into the house weary, discouraged, ashamed.There was no denying that she had compromised herself
irretrievably.CHAPTER XIX


The inconclusive nature of this interview, exciting as it was, did
not leave any doubt in either Lester Kane's or Jennie's mind;
certainly this was not the end of the affair.Kane knew that he was
deeply fascinated.She was sweeter than he had
had any idea of.Her hesitancy, her repeated protests, her gentle "no,
no, no" moved him as music might.Depend upon it, this girl was for
him, and he would get her.What did he
care about what his family or the world might think?It was curious that Kane held the well-founded idea that in time
Jennie would yield to him physically, as she had already done
spiritually.Something about her--a
warm womanhood, a guileless expression of countenance--intimated
a sympathy toward sex relationship which had nothing to do with hard,
brutal immorality.She was the kind of a woman who was made for a
man--one man.All her attitude toward sex was bound up with love,
tenderness, service.When the one man arrived she would love him and
she would go to him.She would yield to him because he was the one man.On Jennie's part there was a great sense of complication and of
possible disaster.If he followed her of course he would learn all.She had not told him about Brander, because she was still under the
vague illusion that, in the end, she might escape.When she left him
she knew that he would come back.She knew, in spite of herself that
she wanted him to do so.Yet she felt that she must not yield, she
must go on leading her straitened, humdrum life.This was her
punishment for having made a mistake.She had made her bed, and she
must lie on it.The Kane family mansion at Cincinnati to which Lester returned
after leaving Jennie was an imposing establishment, which contrasted
strangely with the Gerhardt home.It was a great, rambling, two-story
affair, done after the manner of the French chateaux, but in red brick
and brownstone.It was set down, among flowers and trees, in an almost
park-like inclosure, and its very stones spoke of a splendid dignity
and of a refined luxury.Old Archibald Kane, the father, had amassed a
tremendous fortune, not by grabbing and brow-beating and unfair
methods, but by seeing a big need and filling it.Early in life he had
realized that America was a growing country.There was going to be a
big demand for vehicles--wagons, carriages, drays--and he
knew that some one would have to supply them.Having founded a small
wagon industry, he had built it up into a great business; he made good
wagons, and he sold them at a good profit.It was his theory that most
men were honest; he believed that at bottom they wanted honest things,
and if you gave them these they would buy of you, and come back and
buy again and again, until you were an influential and rich man.He
believed in the measure "heaped full and running over."All through
his life and now in his old age he enjoyed the respect and approval of
every one who knew him."Archibald Kane," you would hear his
competitors say, "Ah, there is a fine man.This man was the father of two sons and three daughters, all
healthy, all good-looking, all blessed with exceptional minds, but
none of them so generous and forceful as their long-living and
big-hearted sire.Robert, the eldest, a man forty years of age, was
his father's right-hand man in financial matters, having a certain
hard incisiveness which fitted him for the somewhat sordid details of
business life.He was of medium height, of a rather spare build, with
a high forehead, slightly inclined to baldness, bright, liquid-blue
eyes, an eagle nose, and thin, firm, even lips.He was a man of few
words, rather slow to action and of deep thought.He sat close to his
father as vice-president of the big company which occupied two whole
blocks in an outlying section of the city.He was a strong man--a
coming man, as his father well knew.Lester, the second boy, was his father's favorite.He was not by
any means the financier that Robert was, but he had a larger vision of
the subtleties that underlie life.He was softer, more human, more
good-natured about everything.And, strangely enough, old Archibald
admired and trusted him.Perhaps he
turned to Robert when it was a question of some intricate financial
problem, but Lester was the most loved as a son.Then there was Amy, thirty-two years of age, married, handsome, the
mother of one child--a boy; Imogene, twenty-eight, also married,
but as yet without children, and Louise, twenty-five, single, the
best-looking of the girls, but also the coldest and most critical.She
was the most eager of all for social distinction, the most vigorous of
all in her love of family prestige, the most desirous that the Kane
family should outshine every other.She was proud to think that the
family was so well placed socially, and carried herself with an air
and a hauteur which was sometimes amusing, sometimes irritating to
Lester!He liked her--in a way she was his favorite
sister--but he thought she might take herself with a little less
seriousness and not do the family standing any harm.Kane, the mother, was a quiet, refined woman, sixty years of
age, who, having come up from comparative poverty with her husband,
cared but little for social life.But she loved her children and her
husband, and was naively proud of their position and attainments.It
was enough for her to shine only in their reflected glory.A good
woman, a good wife, and a good mother.Lester arrived at Cincinnati early in the evening, and drove at
once to his home.An old Irish servitor met him at the door.Lester," he began, joyously, "sure I'm glad to see you
back.Yes, yes, it's been fine weather we're
having.Yes, yes, the family's all well.Sure your sister Amy is just
after leavin' the house with the boy.Your mother's up-stairs in her
room.Lester smiled cheerily and went up to his mother's room.In this,
which was done in white and gold and overlooked the garden to the
south and east, sat Mrs.Kane, a subdued, graceful, quiet woman, with
smoothly laid gray hair.She looked up when the door opened, laid down
the volume that she had been reading, and rose to greet him."There you are, Mother," he said, putting his arms around her and
kissing her."Oh, I'm just about the same, Lester.I was up with the Bracebridges for a few days again.I had
to stop off in Cleveland to see Parsons.She doesn't change any that I can see.She's just
as interested in entertaining as she ever was.""She's a bright girl," remarked his mother, recalling Mrs."She hasn't lost any of that, I can tell you," replied Lester
significantly.Kane smiled and went on to speak of various family
happenings.Old Zwingle, the yard
watchman at the factory, who had been with Mr.Kane for over forty
years, had died.Lester listened
dutifully, albeit a trifle absently.Lester, as he walked down the hall, encountered Louise."Smart" was
the word for her.She was dressed in a beaded black silk dress,
fitting close to her form, with a burst of rubies at her throat which
contrasted effectively with her dark complexion and black hair."Oh, there you are, Lester," she exclaimed.I'm going out, and I'm all fixed, even to
the powder on my nose.Lester had gripped her firmly
and kissed her soundly."I didn't brush much of it off," he said."You can always dust more
on with that puff of yours."He passed on to his own room to dress for
dinner.Dressing for dinner was a custom that had been adopted by the
Kane family in the last few years.Guests had become so common that in
a way it was a necessity, and Louise, in particular, made a point of
it.To-night Robert was coming, and a Mr.Burnett, old
friends of his father and mother, and so, of course, the meal would be
a formal one.Lester knew that his father was around somewhere, but he
did not trouble to look him up now.He was thinking of his last two
days in Cleveland and wondering when he would see Jennie again.CHAPTER XX


As Lester came down-stairs after making his toilet he found his
father in the library reading."Hello, Lester," he said, looking up from his paper over the top of
his glasses and extending his hand."Cleveland," replied his son, shaking hands heartily, and
smiling."Robert tells me you've been to New York.""How did you find my old friend Arnold?""I suppose not," said Archibald Kane genially, as if the report
were a compliment to his own hardy condition."He's been a temperate
man.He led the way back to the sitting-room where they chatted over
business and home news until the chime of the clock in the hall warned
the guests up-stairs that dinner had been served.Lester sat down in great comfort amid the splendors of the great
Louis Quinze dining-room.He liked this homey home
atmosphere--his mother and father and his sisters--the old
family friends.Louise announced that the Leverings were going to give a dance on
Tuesday, and inquired whether he intended to go."You know I don't dance," he returned dryly.If Robert is willing to dance occasionally I think you
might.""Robert's got it on me in lightness," Lester replied, airily."Be that as it may," said Lester."Don't try to stir up a fight, Louise," observed Robert,
sagely.After dinner they adjourned to the library, and Robert talked with
his brother a little on business.There were some contracts coming up
for revision.He wanted to see what suggestions Lester had to make.Louise was going to a party, and the carriage was now announced."Letty Pace asked about you the other night," Louise called back
from the door."She's a nice girl, Lester," put in his father, who was standing
near the open fire."I only wish you would marry her and settle down.asked Lester jocularly--"a conspiracy?You
know I'm not strong on the matrimonial business.""And I well know it," replied his mother semi-seriously.He really could not stand for this sort
of thing any more, he told himself.And as he thought his mind
wandered back to Jennie and her peculiar "Oh no, no!"That was a type of womanhood worth
while.Not sophisticated, not self-seeking, not watched over and set
like a man-trap in the path of men, but a sweet little
girl--sweet as a flower, who was without anybody, apparently, to
watch over her.That night in his room he composed a letter, which he
dated a week later, because he did not want to appear too urgent and
because he could not again leave Cincinnati for at least two
weeks."MY DEAR JENNIE, Although it has been a week, and I have said
nothing, I have not forgotten you--believe me.Was the impression
I gave of myself very bad?I will make it better from now on, for I
love you, little girl--I really do.There is a flower on my table
which reminds me of you very much--white, delicate, beautiful.Your personality, lingering with me, is just that.You are the essence
of everything beautiful to me.It is in your power to strew flowers in
my path if you will."But what I want to say here is that I shall be in Cleveland on the
18th, and I shall expect to see you.I arrive Thursday night, and I
want you to meet me in the ladies' parlor of the Dornton at noon
Friday."You see, I respect your suggestion that I should not call.These separations are dangerous to good
friendship.But I can't take "no" for an answer, not now."She's a remarkable girl in
her way," he thought.CHAPTER XXI


The arrival of this letter, coming after a week of silence and
after she had had a chance to think, moved Jennie deeply.How did she truly feel about this
man?If she did so, what
should she say?Heretofore all her movements, even the one in which
she had sought to sacrifice herself for the sake of Bass in Columbus,
had not seemed to involve any one but herself.Now, there seemed to be
others to consider--her family, above all, her child.The little
Vesta was now eighteen months of age; she was an interesting child;
her large, blue eyes and light hair giving promise of a comeliness
which would closely approximate that of her mother, while her mential
traits indicated a clear and intelligent mind.Gerhardt had
become very fond of her.Gerhardt had unbended so gradually that his
interest was not even yet clearly discernible, but he had a distinct
feeling of kindliness toward her.And this readjustment of her
father's attitude had aroused in Jennie an ardent desire to so conduct
herself that no pain should ever come to him again.Any new folly on
her part would not only be base ingratitude to her father, but would
tend to injure the prospects of her little one.Her life was a
failure, she fancied, but Vesta's was a thing apart; she must do
nothing to spoil it.She wondered whether it would not be better to
write Lester and explain everything.She had told him that she did not
wish to do wrong.Suppose she went on to inform him that she had a
child, and beg him to leave her in peace.Did she really want him to take her at her word?The need of making this confession was a painful thing to Jennie.It caused her to hesitate, to start a letter in which she tried to
explain, and then to tear it up.Finally, fate intervened in the
sudden home-coming of her father, who had been seriously injured by an
accident at the glass-works in Youngstown where he worked.It was on a Wednesday afternoon, in the latter part of August, when
a letter came from Gerhardt.But instead of the customary fatherly
communication, written in German and inclosing the regular weekly
remittance of five dollars, there was only a brief note, written by
another hand, and explaining that the day before Gerhardt had received
a severe burn on both hands, due to the accidental overturning of a
dipper of molten glass.The letter added that he would be home the
next morning.exclaimed William, his mouth wide
open.said Veronica, tears welling up in her eyes.Gerhardt sat down, clasped her hands in her lap, and stared at
the floor.The possibility
that Gerhardt was disabled for life opened long vistas of difficulties
which she had not the courage to contemplate.Bass came home at half-past six and Jennie at eight.The former
heard the news with an astonished face."Did the letter say
how bad he was hurt?""Well, I wouldn't worry about it," said Bass easily.I wouldn't worry like that if I
were you."The truth was, he wouldn't, because his nature was wholly
different.His brain was
not large enough to grasp the significance and weigh the results of
things."I
can't help it, though.To think that just when we were getting along
fairly well this new calamity should be added.It seems sometimes as
if we were under a curse.When Jennie came her mother turned to her instinctively; here was
her one stay.asked Jennie as she opened the door and
observed her mother's face.Gerhardt looked at her, and then turned half away."Pa's had his hands burned," put in Bass solemnly."He'll be home
to-morrow."Jennie looked at her mother, and her eyes dimmed with tears.Instinctively she ran to her and put her arms around her."Now, don't you cry, ma," she said, barely able to control herself.I know how you feel, but we'll get along.Then her own lips lost their evenness, and she struggled long
before she could pluck up courage to contemplate this new disaster.And now without volition upon her part there leaped into her
consciousness a new and subtly persistent thought.What about Lester's
offer of assistance now?Somehow
it came back to her--his affection, his personality, his desire
to help her, his sympathy, so like that which Brander had shown when
Bass was in jail.She thought
this over as she looked at her mother sitting there so silent,
haggard, and distraught."What a pity," she thought, "that her mother
must always suffer!Wasn't it a shame that she could never have any
real happiness?""I wouldn't feel so badly," she said, after a time."Maybe pa isn't
burned so badly as we think.Did the letter say he'd be home in the
morning?"They talked more quietly from now on, and gradually, as the details
were exhausted, a kind of dumb peace settled down upon the
household."One of us ought to go to the train to meet him in the morning,"
said Jennie to Bass."No," said Bass gloomily, "you mustn't.He was sour at this new fling of fate, and he looked his feelings;
he stalked off gloomily to his room and shut himself in.Jennie and
her mother saw the others off to bed, and then sat out in the kitchen
talking."I don't see what's to become of us now," said Mrs.Gerhardt at
last, completely overcome by the financial complications which this
new calamity had brought about.She looked so weak and helpless that
Jennie could hardly contain herself."Don't worry, mamma dear," she said, softly, a peculiar resolve
coming into her heart.There was comfort and ease
in it scattered by others with a lavish hand.Surely, surely
misfortune could not press so sharply but that they could live!She sat down with her mother, the difficulties of the future
seeming to approach with audible and ghastly steps."What do you suppose will become of us now?"repeated her mother,
who saw how her fanciful conception of this Cleveland home had
crumbled before her eyes."Why," said Jennie, who saw clearly and knew what could be done,
"it will be all right.She realized, as she sat there, that fate had shifted the burden of
the situation to her.She must sacrifice herself; there was no other
way.Bass met his father at the railway station in the morning.He
looked very pale, and seemed to have suffered a great deal.His cheeks
were slightly sunken and his bony profile appeared rather gaunt.His
hands were heavily bandaged, and altogether he presented such a
picture of distress that many stopped to look at him on the way home
from the station."By chops," he said to Bass, "that was a burn I got.I thought once
I couldn't stand the pain any longer.He related just how the accident had occurred, and said that he did
not know whether he would ever be able to use his hands again.The
thumb on his right hand and the first two fingers on the left had been
burned to the bone.The latter had been amputated at the first
joint--the thumb he might save, but his hands would be in danger
of being stiff.he added, "just at the time when I needed the money
most.Gerhardt opened the door, the
old mill-worker, conscious of her voiceless sympathy, began to cry.Even Bass lost control of himself for a
moment or two, but quickly recovered.The other children wept, until
Bass called a halt on all of them."Don't cry now," he said cheeringly.It
isn't so bad as all that.Bass's words had a soothing effect, temporarily, and, now that her
husband was home, Mrs.Though his
hands were bandaged, the mere fact that he could walk and was not
otherwise injured was some consolation.He might recover the use of
his hands and be able to undertake light work again.Anyway, they
would hope for the best.When Jennie came home that night she wanted to run to her father
and lay the treasury of her services and affection at his feet, but
she trembled lest he might be as cold to her as formerly.Never had he completely recovered from
the shame which his daughter had brought upon him.Although he wanted
to be kindly, his feelings were so tangled that he hardly knew what to
say or do."Papa," said Jennie, approaching him timidly.Gerhardt looked confused and tried to say something natural, but it
was unavailing.The thought of his helplessness, the knowledge of her
sorrow and of his own responsiveness to her affection--it was all
too much for him; he broke down again and cried helplessly."Forgive me, papa," she pleaded, "I'm so sorry.He did not attempt to look at her, but in the swirl of feeling that
their meeting created he thought that he could forgive, and he
did."I have prayed," he said brokenly.When he recovered himself he felt ashamed of his emotion, but a new
relationship of sympathy and of understanding had been established.From that time, although there was always a great reserve between
them, Gerhardt tried not to ignore her completely, and she endeavored
to show him the simple affection of a daughter, just as in the old
days.But while the household was again at peace, there were other cares
and burdens to be faced.How were they to get along now with five
dollars taken from the weekly budget, and with the cost of Gerhardt's
presence added?Bass might have contributed more of his weekly
earnings, but he did not feel called upon to do it.And so the small
sum of nine dollars weekly must meet as best it could the current
expenses of rent, food, and coal, to say nothing of incidentals, which
now began to press very heavily.Gerhardt had to go to a doctor to
have his hands dressed daily.Either more money must come from some source or the family must beg
for credit and suffer the old tortures of want.The situation
crystallized the half-formed resolve in Jennie's mind.Had he not tried to force money
on her?She finally decided that it was her duty to avail herself of
this proffered assistance.She sat down and wrote him a brief note.She would meet him as he had requested, but he would please not come
to the house.She mailed the letter, and then waited, with mingled
feelings of trepidation and thrilling expectancy, the arrival of the
fateful day.CHAPTER XXII


The fatal Friday came, and Jennie stood face to face with this new
and overwhelming complication in her modest scheme of existence.There
was really no alternative, she thought.If she could make her family happy, if she could
give Vesta a good education, if she could conceal the true nature of
this older story and keep Vesta in the background perhaps,
perhaps--well, rich men had married poor girls before this, and
Lester was very kind, he certainly liked her.At seven o'clock she
went to Mrs.Bracebridge's; at noon she excused herself on the pretext
of some work for her mother and left the house for the hotel.Lester, leaving Cincinnati a few days earlier than he expected, had
failed to receive her reply; he arrived at Cleveland feeling sadly out
of tune with the world.He had a lingering hope that a letter from
Jennie might be awaiting him at the hotel, but there was no word from
her.He was a man not easily wrought up, but to-night he felt
depressed, and so went gloomily up to his room and changed his linen.After supper he proceeded to drown his dissatisfaction in a game of
billiards with some friends, from whom he did not part until he had
taken very much more than his usual amount of alcoholic stimulant.The
next morning he arose with a vague idea of abandoning the whole
affair, but as the hours elapsed and the time of his appointment drew
near he decided that it might not be unwise to give her one last
chance.Accordingly, when it still lacked a quarter of
an hour of the time, he went down into the parlor.Great was his
delight when he beheld her sitting in a chair and waiting--the
outcome of her acquiescence.He walked briskly up, a satisfied,
gratified smile on his face."So you did come after all," he said, gazing at her with the look
of one who has lost and recovered a prize."What do you mean by not
writing me?I thought from the way you neglected me that you had made
up your mind not to come at all."What's the
trouble, Jennie?Nothing gone wrong out at your house, has there?"Yet it opened the door to what she wanted to say."He burned his hands at the glass-works.It looks as though he would not be able to use them any
more."She paused, looking the distress she felt, and he saw plainly that
she was facing a crisis.I've been wanting to get a better understanding of your family
affairs ever since I left."He led the way into the dining-room and
selected a secluded table.He tried to divert her mind by asking her
to order the luncheon, but she was too worried and too shy to do so
and he had to make out the menu by himself.Then he turned to her with
a cheering air."Now, Jennie," he said, "I want you to tell me all
about your family.I got a little something of it last time, but I
want to get it straight.Your father, you said, was a glass-blower by
trade.Now he can't work any more at that, that's obvious.""He's a clerk in a cigar store.""I think it's twelve dollars," she replied thoughtfully."Martha and Veronica don't do anything yet.He gets three
dollars and a half."He stopped, figuring up mentally just what they had to live on.He turned a fork in his hands back and forth; he was thinking
earnestly."To tell you the honest truth, I fancied it was something like
that, Jennie," he said."I've been thinking about you a lot.There's only one answer to your problem, and it isn't such a bad
one, if you'll only believe me."He paused for an inquiry, but she
made none."I thought I wouldn't," she said simply."I knew what you thought," he replied.I'm
going to 'tend to that family of yours.And I'll do it right now while
I think of it."He drew out his purse and extracted several ten and twenty-dollar
bills--two hundred and fifty dollars in all."I want you to take
this," he said.I will see that your family
is provided for from now on.She put it out in answer to the summons of his eyes, and he shut
her fingers on the money, pressing them gently at the same time."I
want you to have it, sweet.I'm not going to
see you suffer, nor any one belonging to you."Her eyes looked a dumb thankfulness, and she bit her lips."I don't know how to thank you," she said."You don't need to," he replied."The thanks are all the other
way--believe me."He paused and looked at her, the beauty of her face holding him.She looked at the table, wondering what would come next."How would you like to leave what you're doing and stay at home?""That would give you your freedom day times.""I couldn't do that," she replied."But there's so little in what
you're doing.I would be glad to
give you fifty times that sum if I thought there was any way in which
you could use it."He idly thrummed the cloth with his fingers.From the way she said it he judged there must be some bond of
sympathy between her and her mother which would permit of a confidence
such as this.He was by no means a hard man, and the thought touched
him."There's only one thing to be done, as far as I can see," he went
on very gently."You're not suited for the kind of work you're doing.Give it up and come with me down
to New York; I'll take good care of you.As
far as your family is concerned, you won't have to worry about them
any more.You can take a nice home for them and furnish it in any
style you please.He paused, and Jennie's thoughts reverted quickly to her mother,
her dear mother.Gerhardt had been talking of
this very thing--a nice home.If they could just have a larger
house, with good furniture and a yard filled with trees, how happy she
would be.In such a home she would be free of the care of rent, the
discomfort of poor furniture, the wretchedness of poverty; she would
be so happy.She hesitated there while his keen eye followed her in
spirit, and he saw what a power he had set in motion.It had been a
happy inspiration--the suggestion of a decent home for the
family.He waited a few minutes longer, and then said:

"Well, wouldn't you better let me do that?""It would be very nice," she said, "but it can't be done now.Papa would want to know all about where I was
going."Why couldn't you pretend that you are going down to New York with
Mrs."There couldn't be any objection to
that, could there?""Not if they didn't find out," she said, her eyes opening in
amazement.Plenty of mistresses take their maids on long
trips.Why not simply tell them you're invited to go--have to
go--and then go?"She thought it over, and the plan did seem feasible.Then she
looked at this man and realized that relationship with him meant
possible motherhood for her again.The tragedy of giving birth to a
child--ah, she could not go through that a second time, at least
under the same conditions.She could not bring herself to tell him
about Vesta, but she must voice this insurmountable objection."I--" she said, formulating the first word of her sentence,
and then stopping.He loved her shy ways, her sweet, hesitating lips.He reached over and laid his strong
brown one on top of it."I couldn't have a baby," she said, finally, and looked down.He gazed at her, and the charm of her frankness, her innate decency
under conditions so anomalous, her simple unaffected recognition of
the primal facts of life lifted her to a plane in his esteem which she
had not occupied until that moment."You're a great girl, Jennie," he said.You don't need to have a
child unless you want to, and I don't want you to."He saw the question written in her wondering, shamed face.You think I know,
don't you?"But anyway, I wouldn't let any trouble come to you.There wouldn't
be any satisfaction in that proposition for me at this time.But there won't be--don't worry."Not for worlds could she have met his
eyes."Look here, Jennie," he said, after a time."You care for me, don't
you?You don't think I'd sit here and plead with you if I didn't care
for you?I'm crazy about you, and that's the literal truth.I want you to do it
quickly.I know how difficult this family business is, but you can
arrange it.We'll pretend a courtship, anything you
like--only come now.""You don't mean right away, do you?"Bracebridge asked you you'd go fast enough, and no one would
think anything about it."It's always so much harder to work out a falsehood," she replied
thoughtfully."I know it, but you can come."Won't you wait a little while?""Not a day, sweet, that I can help."Yes," she replied sorrowfully, and yet with a strange thrill of
affection.CHAPTER XXIII


The business of arranging for this sudden departure was really not
so difficult as it first appeared.Jennie proposed to tell her mother
the whole truth, and there was nothing to say to her father except
that she was going with Mrs.He
might question her, but he really could not doubt Before going home
that afternoon she accompanied Lester to a department store, where she
was fitted out with a trunk, a suit-case, and a traveling suit and
hat."When we get to New York I am
going to get you some real things," he told her."I am going to show
you what you can be made to look like."He had all the purchased
articles packed in the trunk and sent to his hotel.Then he arranged
to have Jennie come there and dress Monday for the trip which began in
the afternoon.Gerhardt, who was in the kitchen, received
her with her usual affectionate greeting."No," she said, "I'm not tired."Oh, I have to tell you something, mamma.She
paused, looking inquiringly at her mother, and then away.So many things had
happened in the past that she was always on the alert for some new
calamity."You haven't lost your place, have you?""No," replied Jennie, with an effort to maintain her mental poise,
"but I'm going to leave it.""Why, when did you decide to do
that?""Yes, I do, mamma.I've got something I want to tell you.There isn't any way we can make things come
out right.I have found some one who wants to help us.He says he
loves me, and he wants me to go to New York with him Monday.You wouldn't do
anything like that after all that's happened."I've thought it all out," went on Jennie, firmly.He
wants me to go with him, and I'd better go.He will take a new house
for us when we come back and help us to get along.No one will ever
have me as a wife--you know that."I thought I'd better not tell him
about her.She oughtn't to be brought into it if I can help it.""I'm afraid you're storing up trouble for yourself, Jennie," said
her mother."Don't you think he is sure to find it out some time?""I thought maybe that she could be kept here," suggested Jennie,
"until she's old enough to go to school.Then maybe I could send her
somewhere.""She might," assented her mother; "but don't you think it would be
better to tell him now?He won't think any the worse of you.""I don't want
her to be brought into it.""Oh, it's been almost two months now.""And you never said anything about him," protested Mrs."I didn't know that he cared for me this way," said Jennie
defensively."Why didn't you wait and let him come out here first?"You can't go and not have
your father find out.""I thought I'd say I was going with Mrs.Papa can't
object to my going with her."Gerhardt, with her
imaginative nature, endeavored to formulate some picture of this new
and wonderful personality that had come into Jennie's life.He was
wealthy; he wanted to take Jennie; he wanted to give them a good home."And he gave me this," put in Jennie, who, with some instinctive
psychic faculty, had been following her mother's mood.She opened her
dress at the neck, and took out the two hundred and fifty dollars; she
placed the money in her mother's hands.Here was the relief for all her
woes--food, clothes, rent, coal--all done up in one small
package of green and yellow bills.If there were plenty of money in
the house Gerhardt need not worry about his burned hands; George and
Martha and Veronica could be clothed in comfort and made happy.Jennie could dress better; there would be a future education for
Vesta."Do you think he might ever want to marry you?""I don't know," replied Jennie "he might."Well," said her mother after a long pause, "if you're going to
tell your father you'd better do it right away.He'll think it's
strange as it is."Her mother had acquiesced from
sheer force of circumstances.She was sorry, but somehow it seemed to
be for the best."I'll help you out with it," her mother had
concluded, with a little sigh.The difficulty of telling this lie was very great for Mrs.Gerhardt, but she went through the falsehood with a seeming
nonchalance which allayed Gerhardt's suspicions.The children were
also told, and when, after the general discussion, Jennie repeated the
falsehood to her father it seemed natural enough."How long do you think you'll be gone?""About two or three weeks," she replied."That's a nice trip," he said."I came through New York in 1844.It
was a small place then compared to what it is now."Secretly he was pleased that Jennie should have this fine chance.When Monday came Jennie bade her parents good-by and left early,
going straight to the Dornton, where Lester awaited her."So you came," he said gaily, greeting her as she entered the
ladies' parlor."You are my niece," he went on."I have engaged H room for you near
mine.I'll call for the key, and you go dress.When you're ready I'll
have the trunk sent to the depot.The train leaves at one
o'clock."She went to her room and dressed, while he fidgeted about, read,
smoked, and finally knocked at her door.She replied by opening to him, fully clad."You look charming," he said with a smile.She looked down, for she was nervous and distraught.The whole
process of planning, lying, nerving herself to carry out her part had
been hard on her.He took her in his arms and kissed her, and they strolled down
the hall.He was astonished to see how well she looked in even these
simple clothes--the best she had ever had.They reached the depot after a short carriage ride.The
accommodations had been arranged for before hand, and Kane had allowed
just enough time to make the train.When they settled themselves in a
Pullman state-room it was with a keen sense of satisfaction on his
part.He had succeeded in
what he had started out to do.As the train rolled out of the depot and the long reaches of the
fields succeeded Jennie studied them wistfully.There were the
forests, leafless and bare; the wide, brown fields, wet with the rains
of winter; the low farm-houses sitting amid flat stretches of prairie,
their low roofs making them look as if they were hugging the ground.The train roared past little hamlets, with cottages of white and
yellow and drab, their roofs blackened by frost and rain.Jennie noted
one in particular which seemed to recall the old neighborhood where
they used to live at Columbus; she put her handkerchief to her eyes
and began silently to cry."I hope you're not crying, are you, Jennie?"said

Lester, looking up suddenly from the letter he had been reading."Come, come," he went on as he saw a faint tremor shaking her.You'll never get along if
you act that way."She made no reply, and the depth of her silent grief filled him
with strange sympathies."Don't cry," he continued soothingly; "everything will be all
right.Jennie made a great effort to recover herself, and began to dry her
eyes."You don't want to give way like that," he continued."It doesn't
do you any good.I know how you feel about leaving home, but tears
won't help it any.It isn't as if you were going away for good, you
know.You care for me, don't
you, sweet?"Yes," she said, and managed to smile back at him.Lester returned to his correspondence and Jennie fell to thinking
of Vesta.It troubled her to realize that she was keeping this secret
from one who was already very dear to her.She knew that she ought to
tell Lester about the child, but she shrank from the painful
necessity.Perhaps later on she might find the courage to do it."I'll have to tell him something," she thought with a sudden
upwelling of feeling as regarded the seriousness of this duty."If I
don't do it soon and I should go and live with him and he should find
it out he would never forgive me.He might turn me out, and then where
would I go?She turned to contemplate him, a premonitory wave of terror
sweeping over her, but she only saw that imposing and comfort-loving
soul quietly reading his letters, his smoothly shaved red cheek and
comfortable head and body looking anything but militant or like an
avenging Nemesis.She was just withdrawing her gaze when he looked
up."Well, have you washed all your sins away?"The touch of fact in it made it
slightly piquant.He turned to some other topic, while she looked out of the window,
the realization that one impulse to tell him had proved unavailing
dwelling in her mind."I'll have to do it shortly," she thought, and
consoled herself with the idea that she would surely find courage
before long.Their arrival in New York the next day raised the important
question in Lester's mind as to where he should stop.New York was a
very large place, and he was not in much danger of encountering people
who would know him, but he thought it just as well not to take
chances.Accordingly he had the cabman drive them to one of the more
exclusive apartment hotels, where he engaged a suite of rooms; and
they settled themselves for a stay of two or three weeks.This atmosphere into which Jennie was now plunged was so wonderful,
so illuminating, that she could scarcely believe this was the same
world that she had inhabited before.Kane was no lover of vulgar
display.The appointments with which he surrounded himself were always
simple and elegant.He knew at a glance what Jennie needed, and bought
for her with discrimination and care.And Jennie, a woman, took a keen
pleasure in the handsome gowns and pretty fripperies that he lavished
upon her.Could this be really Jennie Gerhardt, the washerwoman's
daughter, she asked herself, as she gazed in her mirror at the figure
of a girl clad in blue velvet, with yellow French lace at her throat
and upon her arms?Could these be her feet, clad in soft shapely shoes
at ten dollars a pair, these her hands adorned with flashing jewels?And Lester had promised
that her mother would share in it.Tears sprang to her eyes at the
thought.It was Lester's pleasure in these days to see what he could do to
make her look like some one truly worthy of im.He exercised his most
careful judgment, and the result surprised even himself.People turned
in the halls, in the dining-rooms, and on the street to gaze at
Jennie."A stunning woman that man has with him," was a frequent
comment.Despite her altered state Jennie did not lose her judgment of life
or her sense of perspective or proportion.She felt as though life
were tentatively loaning her something which would be taken away after
a time.There was no pretty vanity in her bosom.Lester realized this
as he watched her."You're a big woman, in your way," he said.Life hasn't given you much of a deal up to
now."He wondered how he could justify this new relationship to his
family, should they chance to hear about it.If he should decide to
take a home in Chicago or St.Louis (there was such a thought running
in his mind) could he maintain it secretly?He was
half persuaded that he really, truly loved her.As the time drew near for their return he began to counsel her as
to her future course of action."You ought to find some way of
introducing me, as an acquaintance, to your father," he said.Then if you tell him you're going
to marry me he'll think nothing of it."Jennie thought of Vesta, and
trembled inwardly.But perhaps her father could be induced to remain
silent.Lester had made the wise suggestion that she should retain the
clothes she had worn in Cleveland in order that she might wear them
home when she reached there."There won't be any trouble about this
other stuff," he said."I'll have it cared for until we make some
other arrangement."It was all very simple and easy; he was a master
strategist.Jennie had written her mother almost daily since she had been East.She had inclosed little separate notes to be read by Mrs.In one she explained Lester's desire to call, and urged her
mother to prepare the way by telling her father that she had met some
one who liked her.She spoke of the difficulty concerning Vesta, and
her mother at once began to plan a campaign o have Gerhardt hold his
peace.Jennie must be given an opportunity
to better herself.Of
course she could not go back to her work, but Mrs.Bracebridge had given Jennie a few weeks' vacation in order
that she might look for something better, something at which he could
make more money.CHAPTER XXIV


The problem of the Gerhardt family and its relationship to himself
comparatively settled, Kane betook himself to Cincinnati and to his
business duties.He was heartily interested in the immense plant,
which occupied two whole blocks in the outskirts of the city, and its
conduct and development was as much a problem and a pleasure to him as
to either his father or his brother.He liked to feel that he was a
vital part of this great and growing industry.When he saw freight
cars going by on the railroads labelled "The Kane Manufacturing
Company--Cincinnati" or chanced to notice displays of the
company's products in the windows of carriage sales companies in the
different cities he was conscious of a warm glow of satisfaction.It
was something to be a factor in an institution so stable, so
distinguished, so honestly worth while.This was all very well, but
now Kane was entering upon a new phase of his personal
existence--in a word, there was Jennie.He was conscious as he
rode toward his home city that he was entering on a relationship which
might involve disagreeable consequences.He was a little afraid of his
father's attitude; above all, there was his brother Robert.Robert was cold and conventional in character; an excellent
business man; irreproachable in both his public and in his private
life.Never overstepping the strict boundaries of legal righteousness,
he was neither warm-hearted nor generous--in fact, he would turn
any trick which could be speciously, or at best necessitously,
recommended to his conscience.How he reasoned Lester did not
know--he could not follow the ramifications of a logic which
could combine hard business tactics with moral rigidity, but somehow
his brother managed to do it."He's got a Scotch Presbyterian
conscience mixed with an Asiatic perception of the main chance."Lester once told somebody, and he had the situation accurately
measured.Nevertheless he could not rout his brother from his
positions nor defy him, for he had the public conscience with him.He
was in line with convention practically, and perhaps
sophisticatedly.The two brothers were outwardly friendly; inwardly they were far
apart.Robert liked Lester well enough personally, but he did not
trust his financial judgment, and, temperamentally, they did not agree
as to how life and its affairs should be conducted.Lester had a
secret contempt for his brother's chill, persistent chase of the
almighty dollar.Robert was sure that Lester's easy-going ways were
reprehensible, and bound to create trouble sooner or later.In the
business they did not quarrel much--there was not so much chance
with the old gentleman still in charge--but there were certain
minor differences constantly cropping up which showed which way the
wind blew.Lester was for building up trade through friendly
relationship, concessions, personal contact, and favors.Robert was
for pulling everything tight, cutting down the cost of production, and
offering such financial inducements as would throttle competition.The old manufacturer always did his best to pour oil on these
troubled waters, but he foresaw an eventual clash.One or the other
would have to get out or perhaps both."If only you two boys could
agree!"Another thing which disturbed Lester was his father's attitude on
the subject of marriage--Lester's marriage, to be specific.Archibald Kane never ceased to insist on the fact that Lester ought to
get married, and that he was making a big mistake in putting it off.All the other children, save Louise, were safely married.It was doing him injury morally, socially, commercially,
that he was sure of."The world expects it of a man in your position," his father had
argued from time to time."It makes for social solidity and prestige.You ought to pick out a good woman and raise a family.Where will you
be when you get to my time of life if you haven't any children, any
home?""Well, if the right woman came along," said Lester, "I suppose I'd
marry her."No, not anybody, of course, but there are lots of good women.You
can surely find some one if you try.I wouldn't drift on this way, Lester;
it can't come to any good.""There, father, let it go now.I'll come
around some time, no doubt.I've got to be thirsty when I'm led to
water."The old gentleman gave over, time and again, but it was a sore
point with him.He wanted his son to settle down and be a real man of
affairs.The fact that such a situation as this might militate against any
permanent arrangement with Jennie was obvious even to Lester at this
time.Of course he
would not give Jennie up, whatever the possible consequences.But he
must be cautious; he must take no unnecessary risks.What a scandal if it were ever found out!Could he
install her in a nice home somewhere near the city?Could he take her along on his
numerous business journeys?This first one to New York had been
successful.He turned the question over in his
mind.Louis, or Pittsburg,
or Chicago would be best after all.He went to these places
frequently, and particularly to Chicago.He decided finally that it
should be Chicago if he could arrange it.He could always make excuses
to run up there, and it was only a night's ride.The very size and activity of the city made concealment easy.After two weeks' stay at Cincinnati Lester wrote Jennie that he was
coming to Cleveland soon, and she answered that she thought it would
be all right for him to call and see her.She had felt it unwise to stay about the house, and so had
secured a position in a store at four dollars a week.He smiled as he
thought of her working, and yet the decency and energy of it appealed
to him."She's the best I've come across
yet."He ran up to Cleveland the following Saturday, and, calling at her
place of business, he made an appointment to see her that evening.He
was anxious that his introduction, as her beau, should be gotten over
with as quickly as possible.When he did call the shabbiness of the
house and the manifest poverty of the family rather disgusted him, but
somehow Jennie seemed as sweet to him as ever.Gerhardt came in the
front-room, after he had been there a few minutes, and shook hands
with him, as did also Mrs.Gerhardt, but Lester paid little attention
to them.The old German appeared to him to be merely
commonplace--the sort of man who was hired by hundreds in common
capacities in his father's factory.After some desultory conversation
Lester suggested to Jennie that they should go for a drive.Jennie put
on her hat, and together they departed.As a matter of fact, they went
to an apartment which he had hired for the storage of her clothes.When she returned at eight in the evening the family considered it
nothing amiss.CHAPTER XXV


A month later Jennie was able to announce that Lester intended to
marry her.His visits had of course paved the way for this, and it
seemed natural enough.He did
not know just how this might be.Lester
seemed a fine enough man in all conscience, and really, after Brander,
why not?If a United States Senator could fall in love with Jennie,
why not a business man?"Has
she told him about Vesta?"Do you think he
wants her if he knows?That's what comes of such conduct in the first
place.Now she has to slip around like a thief.The child cannot even
have an honest name."Gerhardt went back to his newspaper reading and brooding.His life
seemed a complete failure to him and he was only waiting to get well
enough to hunt up another job as watchman.He wanted to get out of
this mess of deception and dishonesty.A week or two later Jennie confided to her mother that Lester had
written her to join him in Chicago.He was not feeling well, and could
not come to Cleveland.The two women explained to Gerhardt that Jennie
was going away to be married to Mr.Gerhardt flared up at this,
and his suspicions were again aroused.But he could do nothing but
grumble over the situation; it would lead to no good end, of that he
was sure.When the day came for Jennie's departure she had to go without
saying farewell to her father.He was out looking for work until late
in the afternoon, and before he had returned she had been obliged to
leave for the station."I will write a note to him when I get there,"
she said."Lester will take a
better house for us soon," she went on hopefully.The night train bore her to Chicago; the old life had ended and
the new one had begun.The curious fact should be recorded here that, although Lester's
generosity had relieved the stress upon the family finances, the
children and Gerhardt were actually none the wiser.Gerhardt to deceive her husband as to the purchase of necessities
and she had not as yet indulged in any of the fancies which an
enlarged purse permitted.But, after Jennie had
been in Chicago for a few days, she wrote to her mother saying that
Lester wanted them to take a new home.This letter was shown to
Gerhardt, who had been merely biding her return to make a scene.He
frowned, but somehow it seemed an evidence of regularity.If he had
not married her why should he want to help them?Perhaps Jennie was
well married after all.Perhaps she really had been lifted to a high
station in life, and was now able to help the family.Gerhardt almost
concluded to forgive her everything once and for all.The end of it was that a new house was decided upon, and Jennie
returned to Cleveland to help her mother move.Together they searched
the streets for a nice, quiet neighborhood, and finally found one.A
house of nine rooms, with a yard, which rented for thirty dollars, was
secured and suitably furnished.There were comfortable fittings for
the dining-room and sitting-room, a handsome parlor set and bedroom
sets complete for each room.The kitchen was supplied with every
convenience, and there was even a bath-room, a luxury the Gerhardts
had never enjoyed before.Altogether the house was attractive, though
plain, and Jennie was happy to know that her family could be
comfortable in it.When the time came for the actual moving Mrs.Gerhardt was fairly
beside herself with joy, for was not this the realization of her
dreams?All through the long years of her life she had been waiting,
and now it had come.A new house, new furniture, plenty of
room--things finer than she had ever even imagined--think of
it!Her eyes shone as she looked at the new beds and tables and
bureaus and whatnots."Dear, dear, isn't this nice!"Jennie smiled and tried to pretend satisfaction
without emotion, but there were tears in her eyes.She was so glad for
her mother's sake.She could have kissed Lester's feet for his
goodness to her family.Gerhardt, Martha, and
Veronica were on hand to clean and arrange things.At the sight of the
large rooms and pretty yard, bare enough in winter, but giving promise
of a delightful greenness in spring, and the array of new furniture
standing about in excelsior, the whole family fell into a fever of
delight.George rubbed his feet over
the new carpets and Bass examined the quality of the furniture
critically.Gerhardt roved to and fro
like a person in a dream.She could not believe that these bright
bedrooms, this beautiful parlor, this handsome dining-room were
actually hers.Although he tried hard not to show it,
he, too, could scarcely refrain from enthusiastic comment.The sight
of an opal-globed chandelier over the dining-room table was the
finishing touch.He looked grimly around, under his shaggy eyebrows, at the new
carpets under his feet, the long oak extension table covered with a
white cloth and set with new dishes, at the pictures on the walls, the
bright, clean kitchen.We want to be careful now
not to break anything.It's so easy to scratch things up, and then
it's all over."CHAPTER XXVI


It would be useless to chronicle the events of the three years that
followed--events and experiences by which the family grew from an
abject condition of want to a state of comparative self-reliance,
based, of course, on the obvious prosperity of Jennie and the
generosity (through her) of her distant husband.Lester was seen now
and then, a significant figure, visiting Cleveland, and sometimes
coming out to the house where he occupied with Jennie the two best
rooms of the second floor.There were hurried trips on her
part--in answer to telegraph massages--to Chicago, to St.One of his favorite pastimes was to engage
quarters at the great resorts--Hot Springs, Mt.Clemens,
Saratoga--and for a period of a week or two at a stretch enjoy
the luxury of living with Jennie as his wife.There were other times
when he would pass through Cleveland only for the privilege of seeing
her for a day.All the time he was aware that he was throwing on her
the real burden of a rather difficult situation, but he did not see
how he could remedy it at this time.He was not sure as yet that he
really wanted to.The attitude of the Gerhardt family toward this condition of
affairs was peculiar.At first, in spite of the irregularity of it, it
seemed natural enough.No one had seen
her marriage certificate, but she said so, and she seemed to carry
herself with the air of one who holds that relationship.Still, she
never went to Cincinnati, where his family lived, and none of his
relatives ever came near her.Then, too, his attitude, in spite of the
money which had first blinded them, was peculiar.He really did not
carry himself like a married man.There were
weeks in which she appeared to receive only perfunctory notes.There
were times when she would only go away for a few days to meet him.Then there were the long periods in which she absented
herself--the only worthwhile testimony toward a real
relationship, and that, in a way, unnatural.Bass, who had grown to be a young man of twenty-five, with some
business judgment and a desire to get out in the world, was
suspicious.He had come to have a pretty keen knowledge of life, and
intuitively he felt that things were not right.George, nineteen, who
had gained a slight foothold in a wall-paper factory and was looking
forward to a career in that field, was also restless.Martha, seventeen, was still in school, as were
William and Veronica.Each was offered an opportunity to study
indefinitely; but there was unrest with life.The neighbors were obviously drawing conclusions for
themselves.Gerhardt himself finally concluded
that there was something wrong, but he had let himself into this
situation, and was not in much of a position now to raise an argument.He wanted to ask her at times--proposed to make her do better if
he could--but the worst had already been done.It depended on the
man now, he knew that.Things were gradually nearing a state where a general upheaval
would have taken place had not life stepped in with one of its
fortuitous solutions.Although stout
and formerly of a fairly active disposition, she had of late years
become decidedly sedentary in her habits and grown weak, which,
coupled with a mind naturally given to worry, and weighed upon as it
had been by a number of serious and disturbing ills, seemed now to
culminate in a slow but very certain case of systemic poisoning.She
became decidedly sluggish in her motions, wearied more quickly at the
few tasks left for her to do, and finally complained to Jennie that it
was very hard for her to climb stairs."I'm not feeling well," she
said."I think I'm going to be sick."Jennie now took alarm and proposed to take her to some near-by
watering-place, but Mrs."I don't think it would
do any good," she said.She sat about or went driving with her
daughter, but the fading autumn scenery depressed her."I don't like
to get sick in the fall," she said."The leaves coming down make me
think I am never going to get well."said Jennie; but she felt frightened,
nevertheless.How much the average home depends upon the mother was seen when it
was feared the end was near.Bass, who had thought of getting married
and getting out of this atmosphere, abandoned the idea temporarily.Gerhardt, shocked and greatly depressed, hung about like one expectant
of and greatly awed by the possibility of disaster.Jennie, too
inexperienced in death to feel that she could possibly lose her
mother, felt as if somehow her living depended on her.Hoping in spite
of all opposing circumstances, she hung about, a white figure of
patience, waiting and serving.The end came one morning after a month of illness and several days
of unconsciousness, during which silence reigned in the house and all
the family went about on tiptoe.Gerhardt passed away with her
dying gaze fastened on Jennie's face for the last few minutes of
consciousness that life vouchsafed her.Jennie stared into her eyes
with a yearning horror.Gerhardt came running in from the yard, and, throwing himself down
by the bedside, wrung his bony hands in anguish.Gerhardt hastened the final breaking up of the
family.Bass was bent on getting married at once, having had a girl in
town for some time.Martha, whose views of life had broadened and
hardened, was anxious to get out also.She felt that a sort of stigma
attached to the home--to herself, in fact, so long as she
remained there.Martha looked to the public schools as a source of
income; she was going to be a teacher.Gerhardt alone scarcely knew
which way to turn.He was again at work as a night watchman.Jennie
found him crying one day alone in the kitchen, and immediately burst
into tears herself.she pleaded, "it isn't as bad as
that.You will always have a home--you know that--as long as
I have anything.He really did not want to go with her."It
isn't that," he continued.It was some little time before Bass, George and Martha finally
left, but, one by one, they got out, leaving Jennie, her father,
Veronica, and William, and one other--Jennie's child.Of course
Lester knew nothing of Vesta's parentage, and curiously enough he had
never seen the little girl.During the short periods in which he
deigned to visit the house--two or three days at most--Mrs.Gerhardt took good care that Vesta was kept in the background.There
was a play-room on the top floor, and also a bedroom there, and
concealment was easy.Lester rarely left his rooms, he even had his
meals served to him in what might have been called the living-room of
the suite.He was not at all inquisitive or anxious to meet any one of
the other members of the family.He was perfectly willing to shake
hands with them or to exchange a few perfunctory words, but
perfunctory words only.It was generally understood that the child
must not appear, and so it did not.There is an inexplicable sympathy between old age and childhood, an
affinity which is as lovely as it is pathetic.During that first year
in Lorrie Street, when no one was looking, Gerhardt often carried
Vesta about on his shoulders and pinched her soft, red cheeks.When
she got old enough to walk he it was who, with a towel fastened
securely under her arms, led her patiently around the room until she
was able to take a few steps of her own accord.When she actually
reached the point where she could walk he was the one who coaxed her
to the effort, shyly, grimly, but always lovingly.By some strange
leading of fate this stigma on his family's honor, this blotch on
conventional morality, had twined its helpless baby fingers about the
tendons of his heart.He loved this little outcast ardently,
hopefully.She was the one bright ray in a narrow, gloomy life, and
Gerhardt early took upon himself the responsibility of her education
in religious matters.Was it not he who had insisted that the infant
should be baptized?"Say 'Our Father,'" he used to demand of the lisping infant when he
had her alone with him."Ow Fowvaw," was her vowel-like interpretation of his words."'Ooh ah in aven,'" repeated the child.Gerhardt, overhearing
the little one's struggles with stubborn consonants and vowels."Because I want she should learn the Christian faith," returned
Gerhardt determinedly.If she don't
begin now she never will know them."Many of her husband's religious
idiosyncrasies were amusing to her.At the same time she liked to see
this sympathetic interest he was taking in the child's upbringing.If
he were only not so hard, so narrow at times.He made himself a
torment to himself and to every one else.On the earliest bright morning of returning spring he was wont to
take her for her first little journeys in the world."Come, now," he
would say, "we will go for a little walk."Gerhardt would fasten on one of her little hoods, for in these
days Jennie kept Vesta's wardrobe beautifully replete.Taking her by
the hand, Gerhardt would issue forth, satisfied to drag first one foot
and then the other in order to accommodate his gait to her toddling
steps.One beautiful May day, when Vesta was four years old, they started
on one of their walks.Everywhere nature was budding and bourgeoning;
the birds twittering their arrival from the south; the insects making
the best of their brief span of life.Sparrows chirped in the road;
robins strutted upon the grass; bluebirds built in the eaves of the
cottages.Gerhardt took a keen delight in pointing out the wonders of
nature to Vesta, and she was quick to respond.exclaimed Vesta, catching sight of a low,
flashing touch of red as a robin lighted upon a twig nearby.Her hand
was up, and her eyes were wide open."Yes," said Gerhardt, as happy as if he himself had but newly
discovered this marvelous creature."It is going to look for a worm now.We
will see if we cannot find its nest.I think I saw a nest in one of
these trees."He plodded peacefully on, seeking to rediscover an old abandoned
nest that he had observed on a former walk."Here it is," he said at
last, coming to a small and leafless tree, in which a winter-beaten
remnant of a home was still clinging."Here, come now, see," and he
lifted the baby up at arm's length."See," said Gerhardt, indicating the wisp of dead grasses with his
free hand, "nest.repeated Vesta, imitating his pointing finger with one of
her own."Yes," said Gerhardt, putting her down again."That was a wren's
nest.Still further they plodded, he unfolding the simple facts of life,
she wondering with the wide wonder of a child.When they had gone a
block or two he turned slowly about as if the end of the world had
been reached.And so she had come to her fifth year, growing in sweetness,
intelligence, and vivacity.Gerhardt was fascinated by the questions
she asked, the puzzles she pronounced."What is it she doesn't want to know?From rising in the morning, to dress her to laying her
down at night after she had said her prayers, she came to be the chief
solace and comfort of his days.Without Vesta, Gerhardt would have
found his life hard indeed to bear.CHAPTER XXVII


For three years now Lester had been happy in the companionship of
Jennie.Irregular as the connection might be in the eyes of the church
and of society, it had brought him peace and comfort, and he was
perfectly satisfied with the outcome of the experiment.His interest
in the social affairs of Cincinnati was now practically nil, and he
had consistently refused to consider any matrimonial proposition which
had himself as the object.He looked on his father's business
organization as offering a real chance for himself if he could get
control of it; but he saw no way of doing so.Robert's interests were
always in the way, and, if anything, the two brothers were farther
apart than ever in their ideas and aims.Lester had thought once or
twice of entering some other line of business or of allying himself
with another carriage company, but he did not feel that ha could
conscientiously do this.Lester had his salary--fifteen thousand
a year as secretary and treasurer of the company (his brother was
vice-president)--and about five thousand from some outside
investments.He had not been so lucky or so shrewd in speculation as
Robert had been; aside from the principal which yielded his five
thousand, he had nothing.Robert, on the other hand, was
unquestionably worth between three and four hundred thousand dollars,
in addition to his future interest in the business, which both
brothers shrewdly suspected would be divided somewhat in their favor.Robert and Lester would get a fourth each, they thought; their sisters
a sixth.It seemed natural that Kane senior should take this view,
seeing that the brothers were actually in control and doing the work.The old gentleman might do anything or
nothing.The probabilities were that he would be very fair and
liberal.At the same time, Robert was obviously beating Lester in the
game of life.There comes a time in every thinking man's life when he pauses and
"takes stock" of his condition; when he asks himself how it fares with
his individuality as a whole, mental, moral, physical, material.This
time comes after the first heedless flights of youth have passed, when
the initiative and more powerful efforts have been made, and he begins
to feel the uncertainty of results and final values which attaches
itself to everything.There is a deadening thought of uselessness
which creeps into many men's minds--the thought which has been
best expressed by the Preacher in Ecclesiastes.he used to say to himself, "whether I live at the White House,
or here at home, or at the Grand Pacific?"But in the very question
was the implication that there were achievements in life which he had
failed to realize in his own career.The White House represented the
rise and success of a great public character.His home and the Grand
Pacific were what had come to him without effort.He decided for the time being--it was about the period of the
death of Jennie's mother--that he would make some effort to
rehabilitate himself.He would cut out idling--these numerous
trips with Jennie had cost him considerable time.If his brother could find avenues of financial
profit, so could he.He would endeavor to assert his
authority--he would try to make himself of more importance in the
business, rather than let Robert gradually absorb everything.Should
he forsake Jennie?--that thought also, came to him.Somehow he did not see how it
could be done.It seemed cruel, useless; above all (though he disliked
to admit it) it would be uncomfortable for himself.He liked
her--loved her, perhaps, in a selfish way.He didn't see how he
could desert her very well.Just at this time he had a really serious difference with Robert.His brother wanted to sever relations with an old and well established
paint company in New York, which had manufactured paints especially
for the house, and invest in a new concern in Chicago, which was
growing and had a promising future.Lester, knowing the members of the
Eastern firm, their reliability, their long and friendly relations
with the house, was in opposition.His father at first seemed to agree
with Lester.But Robert argued out the question in his cold, logical
way, his blue eyes fixed uncompromisingly upon his brother's face."We
can't go on forever," he said, "standing by old friends, just because
father here has dealt with them, or you like them.The business must be stiffened up; we're going to have more
and stronger competition.""It's just as father feels about it," said Lester at last."I have
no deep feeling in the matter.It won't hurt me one way or the other.You say the house is going to profit eventually.I've stated the
arguments on the other side.""I'm inclined to think Robert is right," said Archibald Kane
calmly."Most of the things he has suggested so far have worked
out.""Well, we won't have any more discussion about it
then," he said.He rose and strolled out of the office.The shock of this defeat, coming at a time when he was considering
pulling himself together, depressed Lester considerably.It wasn't
much but it was a straw, and his father's remark about his brother's
business acumen was even more irritating.He was beginning to wonder
whether his father would discriminate in any way in the distribution
of the property.Had he heard anything about his entanglement with
Jennie?Had he resented the long vacations he had taken from business?It did not appear to Lester that he could be justly chargeable with
either incapacity or indifference, so far as the company was
concerned.He was still the investigator of
propositions put up to the house, the student of contracts, the
trusted adviser of his father and mother--but he was being
worsted.He thought about this, but could reach no
conclusion.Later in this same year Robert came forward with a plan for
reorganization in the executive department of the business.He
proposed that they should build an immense exhibition and storage
warehouse on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, and transfer a portion of
their completed stock there.Buyers from the West and country merchants could be more easily
reached and dealt with there.It would be a big advertisement for the
house, a magnificent evidence of its standing and prosperity.Kane
senior and Lester immediately approved of this.Robert suggested that Lester should undertake the
construction of the new buildings.It would probably be advisable for
him to reside in Chicago a part of the time.The idea appealed to Lester, even though it took him away from
Cincinnati, largely if not entirely.It was dignified and not
unrepresentative of his standing in the company.He could live in
Chicago and he could have Jennie with him.The scheme he had for
taking an apartment could now be arranged without difficulty."I'm sure we'll get good results from this all
around," he said.As construction work was soon to begin, Lester decided to move to
Chicago immediately.He sent word for Jennie to meet him, and together
they selected an apartment on the North Side, a very comfortable suite
of rooms on a side street near the lake, and he had it fitted up to
suit his taste.He figured that living in Chicago he could pose as a
bachelor.He would never need to invite his friends to his rooms.There were his offices, where he could always be found, his clubs and
the hotels.To his way of thinking the arrangement was practically
ideal.Of course Jennie's departure from Cleveland brought the affairs of
the Gerhardt family to a climax.Probably the home would be broken up,
but Gerhardt himself took the matter philosophically.He was an old
man, and it did not matter much where he lived.Bass, Martha, and
George were already taking care of themselves.Veronica and William
were still in school, but some provision could be made for boarding
them with a neighbor.The one real concern of Jennie and Gerhardt was
Vesta.It was Gerhardt's natural thought that Jennie must take the
child with her.he asked her, when the day of her
contemplated departure had been set."No; but I'm going to soon," she assured him."It's too bad," he went on.God will punish you,
I'm afraid.I'm getting old--otherwise
I would keep her.There is no one here all day now to look after her
right, as she should be.""I know," said Jennie weakly.I'm going
to have her live with me soon.I won't neglect her--you know
that.""But the child's name," he insisted.Soon
in another year she goes to school.People will want to know who she
is.Jennie understood well enough that it couldn't.The heaviest cross she had to bear was the constant
separations and the silence she was obliged to maintain about Vesta's
very existence.It did seem unfair to the child, and yet Jennie did
not see clearly how she could have acted otherwise.Vesta had good
clothes, everything she needed.Jennie
hoped to give her a good education.If only she had told the truth to
Lester in the first place.Now it was almost too late, and yet she
felt that she had acted for the best.Finally she decided to find some
good woman or family in Chicago who would take charge of Vesta for a
consideration.In a Swedish colony to the west of La Salle Avenue she
came across an old lady who seemed to embody all the virtues she
required--cleanliness, simplicity, honesty.She was a widow,
doing work by the day, but she was glad to make an arrangement by
which she should give her whole time to Vesta.The latter was to go to
kindergarten when a suitable one should be found.She was to have toys
and kindly attention, and Mrs.Olsen was to inform Jennie of any
change in the child's health.Jennie proposed to call every day, and
she thought that sometimes, when Lester was out of town, Vesta might
be brought to the apartment.She had had her with her at Cleveland,
and he had never found out anything.The arrangements completed, Jennie returned at the first
opportunity to Cleveland to take Vesta away.Gerhardt, who had been
brooding over his approaching loss, appeared most solicitous about her
future."She should grow up to be a fine girl," he said."You should
give her a good education--she is so smart."He spoke of the
advisability of sending her to a Lutheran school and church, but
Jennie was not so sure of that.Time and association with Lester had
led her to think that perhaps the public school was better than any
private institution.She had no particular objection to the church,
but she no longer depended upon its teachings as a guide in the
affairs of life.The next day it was necessary for Jennie to return to Chicago.Vesta, excited and eager, was made ready for the journey.Gerhardt had
been wandering about, restless as a lost spirit, while the process of
dressing was going on; now that the hour had actually struck he was
doing his best to control his feelings.He could see that the
five-year-old child had no conception of what it meant to him.She was
happy and self-interested, chattering about the ride and the
train."Be a good little girl," he said, lifting her up and kissing her."See that you study your catechism and say your prayers.And you won't
forget the grandpa--what?--" He tried to go on, but his
voice failed him.Jennie, whose heart ached for her father, choked back her emotion."There," she said, "if I'd thought you were going to act like
that--" She stopped."Go," said Gerhardt, manfully, "go.And he
stood solemnly by as they went out of the door.Then he turned back to
his favorite haunt, the kitchen, and stood there staring at the floor.One by one they were leaving him--Mrs.Gerhardt, Bass, Martha,
Jennie, Vesta.He clasped his hands together, after his old-time
fashion, and shook his head again and again.CHAPTER XXVIII


During the three years in which Jennie and Lester had been
associated there had grown up between them a strong feeling of mutual
sympathy and understanding.Lester truly loved her in his own way.It
was a strong, self-satisfying, determined kind of way, based solidly
on a big natural foundation, but rising to a plane of genuine
spiritual affinity.The yielding sweetness of her character both
attracted and held him.She was true, and good, and womanly to the
very center of her being; he had learned to trust her, to depend upon
her, and the feeling had but deepened with the passing of the
years.On her part Jennie had sincerely, deeply, truly learned to love
this man.At first when he had swept her off her feet, overawed her
soul, and used her necessity as a chain wherewith to bind her to him,
she was a little doubtful, a little afraid of him, although she had
always liked him.Now, however, by living with him, by knowing him
better, by watching his moods, she had come to love him.He was so
big, so vocal, so handsome.His point of view and opinions of anything
and everything were so positive.His pet motto, "Hew to the line, let
the chips fall where they may," had clung in her brain as something
immensely characteristic.Apparently he was not afraid of
anything--God, man, or devil.He used to look at her, holding her
chin between the thumb and fingers of his big brown hand, and say:
"You're sweet, all right, but you need courage and defiance.And her eyes would meet his in dumb
appeal."Never mind," he would add, "you have other things."One of the most appealing things to Lester was the simple way in
which she tried to avoid exposure of her various social and
educational shortcomings.She could not write very well, and once he
found a list of words he had used written out on a piece of paper with
the meanings opposite.He smiled, but he liked her better for it.Louis he watched her
pretending a loss of appetite because she thought that her lack of
table manners was being observed by nearby diners.She could not
always be sure of the right forks and knives, and the strange-looking
dishes bothered her; how did one eat asparagus and artichokes?"You're
hungry, aren't you?"I wouldn't bring you here if
they weren't.I'd tell
you quick enough when there was anything wrong."His brown eyes held a
friendly gleam."I do feel a little nervous at times," she
admitted.By degrees Jennie grew into an understanding of the usages and
customs of comfortable existence.All that the Gerhardt family had
ever had were the bare necessities of life.Now she was surrounded
with whatever she wanted--trunks, clothes, toilet articles, the
whole varied equipment of comfort--and while she liked it all, it
did not upset her sense of proportion and her sense of the fitness of
things.There was no element of vanity in her, only a sense of joy in
privilege and opportunity.She was grateful to Lester for all that he
had done and was doing for her.If only she could hold
him--always!The details of getting Vesta established once adjusted, Jennie
settled down into the routine of home life.Lester, busy about his
multitudinous affairs, was in and out.He had a suite of rooms
reserved for himself at the Grand Pacific, which was then the
exclusive hotel of Chicago, and this was his ostensible residence.His
luncheon and evening appointments were kept at the Union Club.An
early patron of the telephone, he had one installed in the apartment,
so that he could reach Jennie quickly and at any time.He was home two
or three nights a week, sometimes oftener.He insisted at first on
Jennie having a girl of general housework, but acquiesced in the more
sensible arrangement which she suggested later of letting some one
come in to do the cleaning.Her
natural industry and love of order prompted this feeling.Lester liked his breakfast promptly at eight in the morning.He
wanted dinner served nicely at seven.Silverware, cut glass, imported
china--all the little luxuries of life appealed to him.He kept
his trunks and wardrobe at the apartment.He was in the
habit of taking Jennie to the theater now and then, and if he chanced
to run across an acquaintance he always introduced her as Miss
Gerhardt.When he registered her as his wife it was usually under an
assumed name; where there was no danger of detection he did not mind
using his own signature.Thus far there had been no difficulty or
unpleasantness of any kind.The trouble with this situation was that it was criss-crossed with
the danger and consequent worry which the deception in regard to Vesta
had entailed, as well as with Jennie's natural anxiety about her
father and the disorganized home.Jennie feared, as Veronica hinted,
that she and William would go to live with Martha, who was installed
in a boarding-house in Cleveland, and that Gerhardt would be left
alone.He was such a pathetic figure to her, with his injured hands
and his one ability--that of being a watchman--that she was
hurt to think of his being left alone.She knew
that he would not--feeling as he did at present.Would Lester
have him--she was not sure of that.If he came Vesta would have
to be accounted for.The situation in regard to Vesta was really complicated.Owing to
the feeling that she was doing her daughter a great injustice, Jennie
was particularly sensitive in regard to her, anxious to do a thousand
things to make up for the one great duty that she could not perform.She daily paid a visit to the home of Mrs.Olsen, always taking with
her toys, candy, or whatever came into her mind as being likely to
interest and please the child.She liked to sit with Vesta and tell
her stories of fairy and giant, which kept the little girl wide-eyed.At last she went so far as to bring her to the apartment, when Lester
was away visiting his parents, and she soon found it possible, during
his several absences, to do this regularly.After that, as time went
on and she began to know his habits, she became more
bold--although bold is scarcely the word to use in connection
with Jennie.She became venturesome much as a mouse might; she would
risk Vesta's presence on the assurance of even short
absences--two or three days.She even got into the habit of
keeping a few of Vesta's toys at the apartment, so that she could have
something to play with when she came.During these several visits from her child Jennie could not but
realize the lovely thing life would be were she only an honored wife
and a happy mother.Vesta was a most observant little girl.She could
by her innocent childish questions give a hundred turns to the dagger
of self-reproach which was already planted deeply in Jennie's
heart.was one of her simplest and most
frequently repeated questions.Jennie would reply that mamma could not
have her just yet, but that very soon now, just as soon as she
possibly could, Vesta should come to stay always."No, dearest, not just when.You won't mind waiting
a little while."Yes," replied Vesta; "but then she ain't got any nice things now.And Jennie, stricken to the heart, would
take Vesta to the toy shop, and load her down with a new assortment of
playthings.Of course Lester was not in the least suspicious.His observation
of things relating to the home were rather casual.He went about his
work and his pleasures believing Jennie to be the soul of sincerity
and good-natured service, and it never occurred to him that there was
anything underhanded in her actions.Once he did come home sick in the
afternoon and found her absent--an absence which endured from two
o'clock to five.He was a little irritated and grumbled on her return,
but his annoyance was as nothing to her astonishment and fright when
she found him there.She blanched at the thought of his suspecting
something, and explained as best she could.She had gone to see her
washerwoman.She was sorry, too, that her absence had lost her an
opportunity to serve him.It showed her what a mess she was likely to
make of it all.It happened that about three weeks after the above occurrence
Lester had occasion to return to Cincinnati for a week, and during
this time Jennie again brought Vesta to the flat; for four days there
was the happiest goings on between the mother and child.Nothing would have come of this little reunion had it not been for
an oversight on Jennie's part, the far-reaching effects of which she
could only afterward regret.This was the leaving of a little toy lamb
under the large leather divan in the front room, where Lester was wont
to lie and smoke.A little bell held by a thread of blue ribbon was
fastened about its neck, and this tinkled feebly whenever it was
shaken.Vesta, with the unaccountable freakishness of children had
deliberately dropped it behind the divan, an action which Jennie did
not notice at the time.When she gathered up the various playthings
after Vesta's departure she overlooked it entirely, and there it
rested, its innocent eyes still staring upon the sunlit regions of
toyland, when Lester returned.That same evening, when he was lying on the divan, quietly enjoying
his cigar and his newspaper, he chanced to drop the former, fully
lighted.Wishing to recover it before it should do any damage, he
leaned over and looked under the divan.The cigar was not in sight, so
he rose and pulled the lounge out, a move which revealed to him the
little lamb still standing where Vesta had dropped it.He picked it
up, turning it over and over, and wondering how it had come there.It must belong to some neighbor's child in whom Jennie had
taken an interest, he thought.He would have to go and tease her about
this.Accordingly he held the toy jovially before him, and, coming out
into the dining-room, where Jennie was working at the sideboard, he
exclaimed in a mock solemn voice, "Where did this come from?"Jennie, who was totally unconscious of the existence of this
evidence of her duplicity, turned, and was instantly possessed with
the idea that he had suspected all and was about to visit his just
wrath upon her.Instantly the blood flamed in her cheeks and as
quickly left them.she stuttered, "it's a little toy I bought.""I see it is," he returned genially, her guilty tremor not escaping
his observation, but having at the same time no explicable
significance to him."It's frisking around a mighty lone
sheepfold."He touched the little bell at its throat, while Jennie stood there,
unable to speak.It tinkled feebly, and then he looked at her again.His manner was so humorous that she could tell he suspected nothing.However, it was almost impossible for her to recover her
self-possession."You look as though a lamb was a terrible shock to you.""I forgot to take it out from there, that was all," she went on
blindly."It looks as though it has been played with enough," he added more
seriously, and then seeing that the discussion was evidently painful
to her, he dropped it.The lamb had not furnished him the amusement
that he had expected.Lester went back into the front room, stretched himself out and
thought it over.What was there about a toy to
make her grow pale?Surely there was no harm in her harboring some
youngster of the neighborhood when she was alone--having it come
in and play.He thought it over, but
could come to no conclusion.Nothing more was said about the incident of the toy lamb.Time
might have wholly effaced the impression from Lester's memory had
nothing else intervened to arouse his suspicions; but a mishap of any
kind seems invariably to be linked with others which follow close upon
its heels.One evening when Lester happened to be lingering about the flat
later than usual the door bell rang, and, Jennie being busy in the
kitchen, Lester went himself to open the door.He was greeted by a
middle-aged lady, who frowned very nervously upon him, and inquired in
broken Swedish accents for Jennie."Wait a moment," said Lester; and stepping to the rear door he
called her.Jennie came, and seeing who the visitor was, she stepped nervously
out in the hall and closed the door after her.The action instantly
struck Lester as suspicious.He frowned and determined to inquire
thoroughly into the matter.Her face
was white and her fingers seemed to be nervously seeking something to
seize upon.he inquired, the irritation he had felt the
moment before giving his voice a touch of gruffness."I've got to go out for a little while," she at last managed to
reply."Very well," he assented unwillingly."But you can tell me what's
the trouble with you, can't you?"I--I," began Jennie, stammering."I--have--"

"Yes," he said grimly."I have to go on an errand," she stumbled on.I'll tell you when I come back, Lester.She looked vainly at him, her troubled countenance still marked by
preoccupation and anxiety to get away, and Lester, who had never seen
this look of intense responsibility in her before, was moved and
irritated by it."That's all right," he said, "but what's the use of all this
secrecy?Why can't you come out and tell what's the matter with you?What's the use of this whispering behind doors?He paused, checked by his own harshness, and Jennie, who was
intensely wrought up by the information she had received, as well as
the unwonted verbal castigation she was now enduring, rose to an
emotional state never reached by her before."I will, Lester, I will," she exclaimed.I'll tell you everything when I come back.She hurried to the adjoining chamber to get her wraps, and Lester,
who had even yet no clear conception of what it all meant, followed
her stubbornly to the door."See here," he exclaimed in his vigorous, brutal way, "you're not
acting right.He stood in the doorway, his whole frame exhibiting the pugnacity
and settled determination of a man who is bound to be obeyed.Jennie,
troubled and driven to bay, turned at last."It's my child, Lester," she exclaimed.I'll tell you everything when I
come back.""What the hell are you talking
about?""I couldn't help it," she returned."I was afraid--I should
have told you long ago.I meant to only--only--Oh, let me go
now, and I'll tell you all when I come back!"He stared at her in amazement; then he stepped aside, unwilling to
force her any further for the present."Well, go ahead," he said
quietly."Don't you want some one to go along with you?"She hurried forth, white-faced, and he stood there, pondering.Could this be the woman he had thought he knew?Why, she had been
deceiving him for years.He choked a little as he muttered:

"Well, I'll be damned!"CHAPTER XXIX


The reason why Jennie had been called was nothing more than one of
those infantile seizures the coming and result of which no man can
predict two hours beforehand.Vesta had been seriously taken with
membranous croup only a few hours before, and the development since
had been so rapid that the poor old Swedish mother was half frightened
to death herself, and hastily despatched a neighbor to say that Vesta
was very ill and Mrs.This message,
delivered as it was in a very nervous manner by one whose only object
was to bring her, had induced the soul-racking fear of death in Jennie
and caused her to brave the discovery of Lester in the manner
described.Jennie hurried on anxiously, her one thought being to reach
her child before the arm of death could interfere and snatch it from
her, her mind weighed upon by a legion of fears.What if it should
already be too late when she got there; what if Vesta already should
be no more.Instinctively she quickened her pace and as the street
lamps came and receded in the gloom she forgot all the sting of
Lester's words, all fear that he might turn her out and leave her
alone in a great city with a little child to care for, and remembered
only the fact that her Vesta was very ill, possibly dying, and that
she was the direct cause of the child's absence from her; that perhaps
but for the want of her care and attention Vesta might be well
to-night."If I can only get there," she kept saying to herself; and then,
with that frantic unreason which is the chief characteristic of the
instinct-driven mother: "I might have known that God would punish me
for my unnatural conduct.I might have known--I might have
known."When she reached the gate she fairly sped up the little walk and
into the house, where Vesta was lying pale, quiet, and weak, but
considerably better.Several Swedish neighbors and a middle-aged
physician were in attendance, all of whom looked at her curiously as
she dropped beside the child's bed and spoke to her.She had sinned, and sinned
grievously, against her daughter, but now she would make amends so far
as possible.Lester was very dear to her, but she would no longer
attempt to deceive him in anything, even if he left her--she felt
an agonized stab, a pain at the thought--she must still do the
one right thing.Vesta must not be an outcast any longer.Where Jennie was, there must Vesta be.Sitting by the bedside in this humble Swedish cottage, Jennie
realized the fruitlessness of her deception, the trouble and pain it
had created in her home, the months of suffering it had given her with
Lester, the agony it had heaped upon her this night--and to what
end?She sat there and
meditated, not knowing what next was to happen, while Vesta quieted
down, and then went soundly to sleep.Lester, after recovering from the first heavy import of this
discovery, asked himself some perfectly natural questions."Who was
the father of the child?How did it chance to be in
Chicago, and who was taking care of it?"He could ask, but he could
not answer; he knew absolutely nothing.Curiously, now, as he thought, his first meeting with Jennie at
Mrs.What was it about her then that
had attracted him?What made him think, after a few hours'
observation, that he could seduce her to do his will?What was
it--moral looseness, or weakness, or what?There must have been
art in the sorry affair, the practised art of the cheat, and, in
deceiving such a confiding nature as his, she had done even more than
practise deception--she had been ungrateful.Now the quality of ingratitude was a very objectionable thing to
Lester--the last and most offensive trait of a debased nature,
and to be able to discover a trace of it in Jennie was very
disturbing.It is true that she had not exhibited it in any other way
before--quite to the contrary--but nevertheless he saw
strong evidences of it now, and it made him very bitter in his feeling
toward her.How could she be guilty of any such conduct toward him?Had he not picked her up out of nothing, so to speak, and befriended
her?He moved from his chair in this silent room and began to pace
slowly to and fro, the weightiness of this subject exercising to the
full his power of decision.She was guilty of a misdeed which he felt
able to condemn.The original concealment was evil; the continued
deception more.Lastly, there was the thought that her love after all
had been divided, part for him, part for the child, a discovery which
no man in his position could contemplate with serenity.He moved
irritably as he thought of it, shoved his hands in his pockets and
walked to and fro across the floor.That a man of Lester's temperament should consider himself wronged
by Jennie merely because she had concealed a child whose existence was
due to conduct no more irregular than was involved later in the
yielding of herself to him was an example of those inexplicable
perversions of judgment to which the human mind, in its capacity of
keeper of the honor of others, seems permanently committed.Lester,
aside from his own personal conduct (for men seldom judge with that in
the balance), had faith in the ideal that a woman should reveal
herself completely to the one man with whom she is in love; and the
fact that she had not done so was a grief to him.He had asked her
once tentatively about her past.That
was the time she should have spoken of any child.His first impulse, after he had thought the thing over, was to walk
out and leave her.At the same time he was curious to hear the end of
this business.He did put on his hat and coat, however, and went out,
stopping at the first convenient saloon to get a drink.He took a car
and went down to the club, strolling about the different rooms and
chatting with several people whom he encountered.He was restless and
irritated; and finally, after three hours of meditation, he took a cab
and returned to his apartment.The distraught Jennie, sitting by her sleeping child, was at last
made to realize, by its peaceful breathing that all danger was over.There was nothing more that she could do for Vesta, and now the claims
of the home that she had deserted began to reassert themselves, the
promise to Lester and the need of being loyal to her duties unto the
very end.It was just
probable that he wished to hear the remainder of her story before
breaking with her entirely.Although anguished and frightened by the
certainty, as she deemed it, of his forsaking her, she nevertheless
felt that it was no more than she deserved--a just punishment for
all her misdoings.When Jennie arrived at the flat it was after eleven, and the hall
light was already out.She first tried the door, and then inserted her
key.No one stirred, however, and, opening the door, she entered in
the expectation of seeing Lester sternly confronting her.The burning gas had merely been an oversight on his
part.She glanced quickly about, but seeing only the empty room, she
came instantly to the other conclusion, that he had forsaken
her--and so stood there, a meditative, helpless figure.At this moment his footsteps sounded on the stairs.He came in with
his derby hat pulled low over his broad forehead, close to his sandy
eyebrows, and with his overcoat buttoned up closely about his neck.He
took off the coat without looking at Jennie and hung it on the rack.Then he deliberately took off his hat and hung that up also.When he
was through he turned to where she was watching him with wide
eyes."I want to know about this thing now from beginning to end," he
began.Jennie wavered a moment, as one who might be going to take a leap
in the dark, then opened her lips mechanically and confessed:

"It's Senator Brander's."echoed Lester, the familiar name of the dead but
still famous statesman ringing with shocking and unexpected force in
his ears."We used to do his washing for him," she rejoined simply--"my
mother and I."Lester paused, the baldness of the statements issuing from her
sobering even his rancorous mood."Senator Brander's child," he
thought to himself.So that great representative of the interests of
the common people was the undoer of her--a self-confessed
washerwoman's daughter.A fine tragedy of low life all this was.he demanded, his face the picture of a
darkling mood."It's been nearly six years now," she returned.He calculated the time that had elapsed since he had known her, and
then continued:

"How old is the child?"The need for serious thought made his tone
more peremptory but less bitter."Where have you been keeping her all this time?""She was at home until you went to Cincinnati last spring."Was she there the times I came to Cleveland?""Yes," said Jennie; "but I didn't let her come out anywhere where
you could see her.""I thought you said you told your people that you were married," he
exclaimed, wondering how this relationship of the child to the family
could have been adjusted."I did," she replied, "but I didn't want to tell you about her."I didn't know what was going to become of me when I went with you,
Lester.I didn't want to do her any harm if I could help it.I was
ashamed, afterward; when you said you didn't like children I was
afraid."He stopped, the simplicity of her answers removing a part of the
suspicion of artful duplicity which had originally weighed upon him.After all, there was not so much of that in it as mere wretchedness of
circumstance and cowardice of morals.What queer non-moral natures they must have to have brooked any such a
combination of affairs!"Didn't you know that you'd be found out in the long run?""Surely you might have seen that you couldn't raise her
that way.Why didn't you tell me in the first place?I wouldn't have
thought anything of it then."She stood there, the contradictory aspect of these questions and of
his attitude puzzling even herself.She did try to explain them after
a time, but all Lester could gain was that she had blundered along
without any artifice at all--a condition that was so manifest
that, had he been in any other position than that he was, he might
have pitied her.As it was, the revelation concerning Brander was
hanging over him, and he finally returned to that."You say your mother used to do washing for him.How did you come
to get in with him?"Jennie, who until now had borne his questions with unmoving pain,
winced at this.He was now encroaching upon the period that was by far
the most distressing memory of her life.What he had just asked seemed
to be a demand upon her to make everything clear."I was so young, Lester," she pleaded.I used to go to the hotel where he was stopping and get
his laundry, and at the end of the week I'd take it to him again."She paused, and as he took a chair, looking as if he expected to
hear the whole story, she continued: "We were so poor.He used to give
me money to give to my mother.She paused again, totally unable to go on, and he, seeing that it
would be impossible for her to explain without prompting, took up his
questioning again--eliciting by degrees the whole pitiful story.He had written to her, but before
he could come to her he died.It was followed by a period of five
minutes, in which Lester said nothing at all; he put his arm on the
mantel and stared at the wall, while Jennie waited, not knowing what
would follow--not wishing to make a single plea.Lester's face betrayed no sign of either thought or feeling.He was now quite calm, quite sober, wondering what he should do.Jennie was before him as the criminal at the bar.He, the righteous,
the moral, the pure of heart, was in the judgment seat.Now to
sentence her--to make up his mind what course of action he should
pursue.It was a disagreeable tangle, to be sure, something that a man of
his position and wealth really ought not to have anything to do with.This child, the actuality of it, put an almost unbearable face upon
the whole matter--and yet he was not quite prepared to speak.He
turned after a time, the silvery tinkle of the French clock on the
mantel striking three and causing him to become aware of Jennie, pale,
uncertain, still standing as she had stood all this while."Better go to bed," he said at last, and fell again to pondering
this difficult problem.But Jennie continued to stand there wide-eyed, expectant, ready to
hear at any moment his decision as to her fate.After a long time of musing he turned and went to the
clothes-rack near the door."Better go to bed," he said, indifferently.She turned instinctively, feeling that even in this crisis there
was some little service that she might render, but he did not see her.He went out, vouchsafing no further speech.She looked after him, and as his footsteps sounded on the stair she
felt as if she were doomed and hearing her own death-knell.She stood there a dissonance of
despair, and when the lower door clicked moved her hand out of the
agony of her suppressed hopelessness.In the light of a late dawn she was still sitting there pondering,
her state far too urgent for idle tears.CHAPTER XXX


The sullen, philosophic Lester was not so determined upon his
future course of action as he appeared to be.Stern as was his mood,
he did not see, after all, exactly what grounds he had for complaint.And yet the child's existence complicated matters considerably.He did
not like to see the evidence of Jennie's previous misdeeds walking
about in the shape of a human being; but, as a matter of fact, he
admitted to himself that long ago he might have forced Jennie's story
out of her if he had gone about it in earnest.She would not have
lied, he knew that.At the very outset he might have demanded the
history of her past.He had not done so; well, now it was too late.The one thing it did fix in his mind was that it would be useless to
ever think of marrying her.It couldn't be done, not by a man in his
position.The best solution of the problem was to make reasonable
provision for Jennie and then leave her.He went to his hotel with his
mind made up, but he did not actually say to himself that he would do
it at once.It is an easy thing for a man to theorize in a situation of this
kind, quite another to act.Our comforts, appetites and passions grow
with usage, and Jennie was not only a comfort, but an appetite, with
him.Almost four years of constant association had taught him so much
about her and himself that he was not prepared to let go easily or
quickly.He could think of it bustling
about the work of a great organization during the daytime, but when
night came it was a different matter.He could be lonely, too, he
discovered much to his surprise, and it disturbed him.One of the things that interested him in this situation was
Jennie's early theory that the intermingling of Vesta with him and her
in this new relationship would injure the child.Just how did she come
by that feeling, he wanted to know?His place in the world was better
than hers, yet it dawned on him after a time that there might have
been something in her point of view.She did not know who he was or
what he would do with her.Being
uncertain, she wished to protect her baby.Then
again, he was curious to know what the child was like.The daughter of
a man like Senator Brander might be somewhat of an infant.He was a
brilliant man and Jennie was a charming woman.He thought of this,
and, while it irritated him, it aroused his curiosity.He ought to go
back and see the child--he was really entitled to a view of
it--but he hesitated because of his own attitude in the
beginning.It seemed to him that he really ought to quit, and here he
was parleying with himself.These years of living with Jennie
had made him curiously dependent upon her.Who had ever been so close
to him before?His mother loved him, but her attitude toward him had
not so much to do with real love as with ambition.His
father--well, his father was a man, like himself.All of his
sisters were distinctly wrapped up in their own affairs; Robert and he
were temperamentally uncongenial.With Jennie he had really been
happy, he had truly lived.She was necessary to him; the longer he
stayed away from her the more he wanted her.He finally decided to
have a straight-out talk with her, to arrive at some sort of
understanding.She ought to get the child and take care of it.She
must understand that he might eventually want to quit.She ought to be
made to feel that a definite change had taken place, though no
immediate break might occur.That same evening he went out to the
apartment.Jennie heard him enter, and her heart began to flutter.Then she took her courage in both hands, and went to meet him."There's just one thing to be done about this as far as I can see,"
began Lester, with characteristic directness."Get the child and bring her here where you can take care of her.There's no use leaving her in the hands of strangers.""I will, Lester," said Jennie submissively."Very well, then, you'd better do it at once."He took an evening
newspaper out of his pocket and strolled toward one of the front
windows; then he turned to her."You and I might as well understand
each other, Jennie," he went on."I can see how this thing came about.It was a piece of foolishness on my part not to have asked you before,
and made you tell me.It was silly for you to conceal it, even if you
didn't want the child's life mixed with mine.You might have known
that it couldn't be done.That's neither here nor there, though, now.The thing that I want to point out is that one can't live and hold a
relationship such as ours without confidence.You and I had that, I
thought.I don't see my way clear to ever hold more than a tentative
relationship with you on this basis."Now, I don't propose to do anything hasty.For my part I don't see
why things can't go on about as they are--certainly for the
present--but I want you to look the facts in the face.""I know, Lester," she said, "I know."There were some trees in the
yard, where the darkness was settling.He wondered how this would
really come out, for he liked a home atmosphere.Should he leave the
apartment and go to his club?"You'd better get the dinner," he suggested, after a time, turning
toward her irritably; but he did not feel so distant as he looked.It
was a shame that life could not be more decently organized.He
strolled back to his lounge, and Jennie went about her duties.She was
thinking of Vesta, of her ungrateful attitude toward Lester, of his
final decision never to marry her.So that was how one dream had been
wrecked by folly.She spread the table, lighted the pretty silver candles, made his
favorite biscuit, put a small leg of lamb in the oven to roast, and
washed some lettuce-leaves for a salad.She had been a diligent
student of a cook-book for some time, and she had learned a good deal
from her mother.All the time she was wondering how the situation
would work out.He would leave her eventually--no doubt of that.He would go away and marry some one else."Oh, well," she thought finally, "he is not going to leave me right
away--that is something.She sighed
as she carried the things to the table.If life would only give her
Lester and Vesta together--but that hope was over.CHAPTER XXXI


There was peace and quiet for some time after this storm.Jennie
went the next day and brought Vesta away with her.The joy of the
reunion between mother and child made up for many other worries."Now
I can do by her as I ought," she thought; and three or four times
during the day she found herself humming a little song.He was trying to make
himself believe that he ought to do something toward reforming his
life--toward bringing about that eventual separation which he had
suggested.He did not like the idea of a child being in this
apartment--particularly that particular child.He fought his way
through a period of calculated neglect, and then began to return to
the apartment more regularly.In spite of all its drawbacks, it was a
place of quiet, peace, and very notable personal comfort.During the first days of Lester's return it was difficult for
Jennie to adjust matters so as to keep the playful, nervous, almost
uncontrollable child from annoying the staid, emphatic,
commercial-minded man.Jennie gave Vesta a severe talking to the first
night Lester telephoned that he was coming, telling her that he was a
very bad-tempered man who didn't like children, and that she mustn't
go near him."You mustn't talk," she said.Let mamma ask you what you want.Vesta agreed solemnly, but her childish mind hardly grasped the
full significance of the warning.Jennie, who had taken great pains to array
Vesta as attractively as possible, had gone into her bedroom to give
her own toilet a last touch.As a
matter of fact, she had followed her mother to the door of the
sitting-room, where now she could be plainly seen.Lester hung up his
hat and coat, then, turning, he caught his first glimpse.The child
looked very sweet--he admitted that at a glance.She was arrayed
in a blue-dotted, white flannel dress, with a soft roll collar and
cuffs, and the costume was completed by white stockings and shoes.Her
corn-colored ringlets hung gaily about her face.Blue eyes, rosy lips,
rosy cheeks completed the picture.Lester stared, almost inclined to
say something, but restrained himself.When Jennie came out he commented on the fact that Vesta had
arrived."Rather sweet-looking child," he said."Do you have much
trouble in making her mind?"Jennie went on to the dining-room, and Lester overheard a scrap of
their conversation.Didn't I tell you you mustn't
talk?"What might have followed if the child had been homely, misshapen,
peevish, or all three, can scarcely be conjectured.Had Jennie been
less tactful, even in the beginning, he might have obtained a
disagreeable impression.As it was, the natural beauty of the child,
combined with the mother's gentle diplomacy in keeping her in the
background, served to give him that fleeting glimpse of innocence and
youth which is always pleasant.The thought struck him that Jennie had
been the mother of a child all these years; she had been separated
from it for months at a time; she had never even hinted at its
existence, and yet her affection for Vesta was obviously great."It's
queer," he said.One morning Lester was sitting in the parlor reading his paper when
he thought he heard something stir.He turned, and was surprised to
see a large blue eye fixed upon him through the crack of a neighboring
door--the effect was most disconcerting.It was not like the
ordinary eye, which, under such embarrassing circumstances, would have
been immediately withdrawn; it kept its position with deliberate
boldness.He turned his paper solemnly and looked again.He crossed his
legs and looked again.This little episode, unimportant in itself, was yet informed with
the saving grace of comedy, a thing to which Lester was especially
responsive.Although not in the least inclined to relax his attitude
of aloofness, he found his mind, in the minutest degree, tickled by
the mysterious appearance; the corners of his mouth were animated by a
desire to turn up.He did not give way to the feeling, and stuck by
his paper, but the incident remained very clearly in his mind.The
young wayfarer had made her first really important impression upon
him.Not long after this Lester was sitting one morning at breakfast,
calmly eating his chop and conning his newspaper, when he was aroused
by another visitation--this time not quite so simple.Jennie had
given Vesta her breakfast, and set her to amuse herself alone until
Lester should leave the house.Jennie was seated at the table, pouring
out the coffee, when Vesta suddenly appeared, very business-like in
manner, and marched through the room.Lester looked up, and Jennie
colored and arose.By this time, however, Vesta had reached the kitchen, secured a
little broom, and returned, a droll determination lighting her
face."I want my little broom," she exclaimed and marched sedately past,
at which manifestation of spirit Lester again twitched internally,
this time allowing the slightest suggestion of a smile to play across
his mouth.The final effect of this intercourse was gradually to break down
the feeling of distaste Lester had for the child, and to establish in
its place a sort of tolerant recognition of her possibilities as a
human being.The developments of the next six months were of a kind to further
relax the strain of opposition which still existed in Lester's mind.Although not at all resigned to the somewhat tainted atmosphere in
which he was living, he yet found himself so comfortable that he could
not persuade himself to give it up.It was too much like a bed of
down.The condition of unquestioned
liberty, so far as all his old social relationships were concerned,
coupled with the privilege of quiet, simplicity, and affection in the
home was too inviting.He lingered on, and began to feel that perhaps
it would be just as well to let matters rest as they were.During this period his friendly relations with the little Vesta
insensibly strengthened.He discovered that there was a real flavor of
humor about Vesta's doings, and so came to watch for its development.She was forever doing something interesting, and although Jennie
watched over her with a care that was in itself a revelation to him,
nevertheless Vesta managed to elude every effort to suppress her and
came straight home with her remarks.Once, for example, she was sawing
away at a small piece of meat upon her large plate with her big knife,
when Lester remarked to Jennie that it might be advisable to get her a
little breakfast set.Jennie, who never could tell what was to follow,
reached over and put it down, while Lester with difficulty restrained
a desire to laugh.Another morning, not long after, she was watching Jennie put the
lumps of sugar in Lester's cup, when she broke in with, "I want two
lumps in mine, mamma.""No, dearest," replied Jennie, "you don't need any in yours."Uncle Lester has two," she protested."Yes," returned Jennie; "but you're only a little girl.Besides you
mustn't say anything like that at the table."Uncle Lester eats too much sugar," was her immediate rejoinder, at
which that fine gourmet smiled broadly."I don't know about that," he put in, for the first time deigning
to answer her directly."That sounds like the fox and grapes to me."Vesta smiled back at him, and now that the ice was broken she
chattered on unrestrainedly.One thing led to another, and at last
Lester felt as though, in a way, the little girl belonged to him; he
was willing even that she should share in such opportunities as his
position and wealth might make possible--provided, of course,
that he stayed with Jennie, and that they worked out some arrangement
which would not put him hopelessly out of touch with the world which
was back of him, and which he had to keep constantly in mind.CHAPTER XXXII


The following spring the show-rooms and warehouse were completed,
and Lester removed his office to the new building.Heretofore, he had
been transacting all his business affairs at the Grand Pacific and the
club.From now on he felt himself to be firmly established in
Chicago--as if that was to be his future home.A large number of
details were thrown upon him--the control of a considerable
office force, and the handling of various important transactions.It
took away from him the need of traveling, that duty going to Amy's
husband, under the direction of Robert.The latter was doing his best
to push his personal interests, not only through the influence he was
bringing to bear upon his sisters, but through his reorganization of
the factory.Several men whom Lester was personally fond of were in
danger of elimination.But Lester did not hear of this, and Kane
senior was inclined to give Robert a free hand.He was glad to see some one with a strong policy come up and take
charge.Apparently he and Robert were on
better terms than ever before.Matters might have gone on smoothly enough were it not for the fact
that Lester's private life with Jennie was not a matter which could be
permanently kept under cover.At times he was seen driving with her by
people who knew him in a social and commercial way.He was for
brazening it out on the ground that he was a single man, and at
liberty to associate with anybody he pleased.Jennie might be any
young woman of good family in whom he was interested.He did not
propose to introduce her to anybody if he could help it, and he always
made it a point to be a fast traveler in driving, in order that others
might not attempt to detain and talk to him.At the theater, as has
been said, she was simply "Miss Gerhardt."The trouble was that many of his friends were also keen observers
of life.They had no quarrel to pick with Lester's conduct.Only he
had been seen in other cities, in times past, with this same woman.She must be some one whom he was maintaining irregularly.Wealth and youthful spirits must have their fling.Rumors came
to Robert, who, however, kept his own counsel.If Lester wanted to do
this sort of thing, well and good.But there must come a time when
there would be a show-down.This came about in one form about a year and a half after Lester
and Jennie had been living in the north side apartment.It so happened
that, during a stretch of inclement weather in the fall, Lester was
seized with a mild form of grip.When he felt the first symptoms he
thought that his indisposition would be a matter of short duration,
and tried to overcome it by taking a hot bath and a liberal dose of
quinine.But the infection was stronger than he counted on; by morning
he was flat on his back, with a severe fever and a splitting
headache.His long period of association with Jennie had made him incautious.Policy would have dictated that he should betake himself to his hotel
and endure his sickness alone.As a matter of fact, he was very glad
to be in the house with her.He had to call up the office to say that
he was indisposed and would not be down for a day or so; then he
yielded himself comfortably to her patient ministrations.Jennie, of course, was delighted to have Lester with her, sick or
well.She persuaded him to see a doctor and have him prescribe.She
brought him potions of hot lemonade, and bathed his face and hands in
cold water over and over.Later, when he was recovering, she made him
appetizing cups of beef-tea or gruel.It was during this illness that the first real contretemps
occurred.Lester's sister Louise, who had been visiting friends in St.Paul, and who had written him that she might stop off to see him on
her way, decided upon an earlier return than she had originally
planned.While Lester was sick at his apartment she arrived in
Chicago.Calling up the office, and finding that he was not there and
would not be down for several days, she asked where he could be
reached."I think he is at his rooms in the Grand Pacific," said an
incautious secretary.Louise, a little
disturbed, telephoned to the Grand Pacific, and was told that Mr.Kane
had not been there for several days--did not, as a matter of
fact, occupy his rooms more than one or two days a week.Piqued by
this, she telephoned his club.It so happened that at the club there was a telephone boy who had
called up the apartment a number of times for Lester himself.He had
not been cautioned not to give its number--as a matter of fact,
it had never been asked for by any one else.When Louise stated that
she was Lester's sister, and was anxious to find him, the boy replied,
"I think he lives at 19 Schiller Place.""Whose address is that you're giving?""Well, don't be giving out addresses.The boy apologized, but Louise had hung up the receiver and was
gone.About an hour later, curious as to this third residence of her
brother, Louise arrived at Schiller Place.Ascending the
steps--it was a two-apartment house--she saw the name of
Kane on the door leading to the second floor.Ringing the bell, she
was opened to by Jennie, who was surprised to see so fashionably
attired a young woman.Kane's apartment, I believe," began Louise,
condescendingly, as she looked in at the open door behind Jennie.She
was a little surprised to meet a young woman, but her suspicions were
as yet only vaguely aroused.Jennie, had she had time to collect her thoughts, would have tried
to make some excuse, but Louise, with the audacity of her birth and
station, swept past before Jennie could say a word.Once inside Louise
looked about her inquiringly.She found herself in the sitting-room,
which gave into the bedroom where Lester was lying.Vesta happened to
be playing in one corner of the room, and stood up to eye the
new-comer.The open bedroom showed Lester quite plainly lying in bed,
a window to the left of him, his eyes closed."Oh, there you are, old fellow!"Lester, who at the sound of her voice had opened his eyes, realized
in an instant how things were.He pulled himself up on one elbow, but
words failed him."Why, hello, Louise," he finally forced himself to say.I came back sooner than I thought," she answered lamely,
a sense of something wrong irritating her."I had a hard time finding
you, too.Who's your--" she was about to say "pretty
housekeeper," but turned to find Jennie dazedly gathering up certain
articles in the adjoining room and looking dreadfully distraught.His sister swept the place with an observing eye.It took in the
home atmosphere, which was both pleasing and suggestive.There was a
dress of Jennie's lying across a chair, in a familiar way, which
caused Miss Kane to draw herself up warily.She looked at her brother,
who had a rather curious expression in his eyes--he seemed
slightly nonplussed, but cool and defiant."You shouldn't have come out here," said Lester finally, before
Louise could give vent to the rising question in her mind."You're my brother, aren't you?Why should you have any place that I
couldn't come.Well, I like that--and from you to me.""Listen, Louise," went on Lester, drawing himself up further on one
elbow."You know as much about life as I do.There is no need of our
getting into an argument.I didn't know you were coming, or I would
have made other arrangements.""Other arrangements, indeed," she sneered.She was greatly irritated to think that she had fallen into this
trap; it was really disgraceful of Lester."I wouldn't be so haughty about it," he declared, his color rising."I'm not apologizing to you for my conduct.I'm saying I would have
made other arrangements, which is a very different thing from begging
your pardon.If you don't want to be civil, you needn't.""I thought
better of you, honestly I did.I should think you would be ashamed of
yourself living here in open--" she paused without using the
word--"and our friends scattered all over the city.I thought you had more sense of decency and
consideration.""I tell you I'm not apologizing to
you.If you don't like this you know what you can do."she demanded, savagely and yet
curiously.If it were it wouldn't make any
difference.I wish you wouldn't busy yourself about my affairs."Jennie, who had been moving about the dining-room beyond the
sitting-room, heard the cutting references to herself.I won't any more," retorted Louise."I
should think, though, that you, of all men, would be above anything
like this--and that with a woman so obviously beneath you.Why, I
thought she was--" she was again going to add "your housekeeper,"
but she was interrupted by Lester, who was angry to the point of
brutality."Never mind what you thought she was," he growled."She's better
than some who do the so-called superior thinking.It's neither here nor there, I tell you.I'm doing this, and I
don't care what you think."Well, I won't, I assure you," she flung back."It's quite plain
that your family means nothing to you.But if you had any sense of
decency, Lester Kane, you would never let your sister be trapped into
coming into a place like this.I'm disgusted, that's all, and so will
the others be when they hear of it."She turned on her heel and walked scornfully out, a withering look
being reserved for Jennie, who had unfortunately stepped near the door
of the dining-room.Jennie came in a little
while later and closed the door.Lester,
his thick hair pushed back from his vigorous face, leaned back moodily
on his pillow."What a devilish trick of fortune," he thought.Now she
would go home and tell it to the family.His father would know, and
his mother.Robert, Imogene, Amy all would hear.He would have no
explanation to make--she had seen.Meanwhile Jennie, moving about her duties, also found food for
reflection.So this was her real position in another woman's eyes.Now
she could see what the world thought.This family was as aloof from
her as if it lived on another planet.To his sisters and brothers, his
father and mother, she was a bad woman, a creature far beneath him
socially, far beneath him mentally and morally, a creature of the
streets.And she had hoped somehow to rehabilitate herself in the eyes
of the world.It cut her as nothing before had ever done.The thought
tore a great, gaping wound in her sensibilities.She was really low
and vile in her--Louise's--eyes, in the world's eyes,
basically so in Lester's eyes.She went
about numb and still, but the ache of defeat and disgrace was under it
all.Oh, if she could only see some way to make herself right with the
world, to live honorably, to be decent.How could that possibly be
brought about?CHAPTER XXXIII


Outraged in her family pride, Louise lost no time in returning to
Cincinnati, where she told the story of her discovery, embellished
with many details.According to her, she was met at the door by a
"silly-looking, white-faced woman," who did not even offer to invite
her in when she announced her name, but stood there "looking just as
guilty as a person possibly could."Lester also had acted shamefully,
having outbrazened the matter to her face.When she had demanded to
know whose the child was he had refused to tell her."It isn't mine,"
was all he would say.Kane, who was the first to hear
the story.exclaimed Louise emphatically, as though the
words needed to be reiterated to give them any shadow of reality."I went there solely because I thought I could help him," continued
Louise."I thought when they said he was indisposed that he might be
seriously ill."To think he would come to
anything like that!"Kane turned the difficult problem over in her mind and, having
no previous experiences whereby to measure it, telephoned for old
Archibald, who came out from the factory and sat through the
discussion with a solemn countenance.So Lester was living openly with
a woman of whom they had never heard.He would probably be as defiant
and indifferent as his nature was strong.The standpoint of parental
authority was impossible.Lester was a centralized authority in
himself, and if any overtures for a change of conduct were to be made,
they would have to be very diplomatically executed.Archibald Kane returned to the manufactory sore and disgusted, but
determined that something ought to be done.He held a consultation
with Robert, who confessed that he had heard disturbing rumors from
time to time, but had not wanted to say anything.Kane suggested
that Robert might go to Chicago and have a talk with Lester."He ought to see that this thing, if continued, is going to do him
irreparable damage," said Mr."He cannot hope to carry it off
successfully.He ought to marry her or he ought to quit.I
want you to tell him that for me.""All well and good," said Robert, "but who's going to convince him?I'm sure I don't want the job.""I hope to," said old Archibald, "eventually; but you'd better go
up and try, anyhow."I don't believe it," replied Robert.You see
how much good talk does down here.Still, I'll go if it will relieve
your feelings any."Yes, yes," said his father distractedly, "better go."Without allowing himself to anticipate any
particular measure of success in this adventure, he rode pleasantly
into Chicago confident in the reflection that he had all the powers of
morality and justice on his side.Upon Robert's arrival, the third morning after Louise's interview,
he called up the warerooms, but Lester was not there.He then
telephoned to the house, and tactfully made an appointment.Lester was
still indisposed, but he preferred to come down to the office, and he
did.He met Robert in his cheerful, nonchalant way, and together they
talked business for a time."Well, I suppose you know what brought me up here," began Robert
tentatively."I think I could make a guess at it," Lester replied."They were all very much worried over the fact that you were
sick--mother particularly.You're not in any danger of having a
relapse, are you?""Louise said there was some sort of a peculiar menage
she ran into up here."The young woman Louise saw is just--" Robert waved his hand
expressively."I don't want to be inquisitive, Lester.I'm simply here because the family felt that I ought to come.Mother
was so very much distressed that I couldn't do less than see you for
her sake"--he paused, and Lester, touched by the fairness and
respect of his attitude, felt that mere courtesy at least made some
explanation due."I don't know that anything I can say will help matters much," he
replied thoughtfully.I have the
woman and the family has its objections.The chief difficulty about
the thing seems to be the bad luck in being found out."He stopped, and Robert turned over the substance of this worldly
reasoning in his mind.He seemed, as
usual, to be most convincingly sane."You're not contemplating marrying her, are you?""I hadn't come to that," answered Lester coolly.They looked at each other quietly for a moment, and then Robert
turned his glance to the distant scene of the city."It's useless to ask whether you are seriously in love with her, I
suppose," ventured Robert."I don't know whether I'd be able to discuss that divine afflatus
with you or not," returned Lester, with a touch of grim humor."I have
never experienced the sensation myself.All I know is that the lady is
very pleasing to me.""Well, it's all a question of your own well-being and the family's,
Lester," went on Robert, after another pause."Morality doesn't seem
to figure in it anyway--at least you and I can't discuss that
together.Your feelings on that score naturally relate to you alone.But the matter of your own personal welfare seems to me to be
substantial enough ground to base a plea on.The family's feelings and
pride are also fairly important.Father's the kind of a man who sets
more store by the honor of his family than most men.You know that as
well as I do, of course.""I know how father feels about it," returned Lester."The whole
business is as clear to me as it is to any of you, though off-hand I
don't see just what's to be done about it.These matters aren't always
of a day's growth, and they can't be settled in a day.To a certain extent I'm responsible that she is here.While I'm
not willing to go into details, there's always more in these affairs
than appears on the court calendar.""Of course I don't know what your relations with her have been,"
returned Robert, "and I'm not curious to know, but it does look like a
bit of injustice all around, don't you think--unless you intend
to marry her?"This last was put forth as a feeler."I might be willing to agree to that, too," was Lester's baffling
reply, "if anything were to be gained by it.The point is, the woman
is here, and the family is in possession of the fact.Now if there is
anything to be done I have to do it.There isn't anybody else who can
act for me in this matter."Lester lapsed into a silence, and Robert rose and paced the floor,
coming back after a time to say: "You say you haven't any idea of
marrying her--or rather you haven't come to it.It seems to me you would be making the mistake of your life,
from every point of view.I don't want to orate, but a man of your
position has so much to lose; you can't afford to do it.Aside from
family considerations, you have too much at stake.You'd be simply
throwing your life away--"

He paused, with his right hand held out before him, as was
customary when he was deeply in earnest, and Lester felt the candor
and simplicity of this appeal.He
was making an appeal to him, and this was somewhat different.The appeal passed without comment, however, and then Robert began
on a new tack, this time picturing old Archibald's fondness for Lester
and the hope he had always entertained that he would marry some
well-to-do Cincinnati girl, Catholic, if agreeable to him, but at
least worthy of his station.Kane felt the same way; surely
Lester must realize that."I know just how all of them feel about it," Lester interrupted at
last, "but I don't see that anything's to be done right now.""You mean that you don't think it would be policy for you to give
her up just at present?""I mean that she's been exceptionally good to me, and that I'm
morally under obligations to do the best I can by her.What that may
be, I can't tell.""Certainly not to turn her out bag and baggage if she has been
accustomed to live with me," replied Lester.Robert sat down again, as if he considered his recent appeal
futile."Can't family reasons persuade you to make some amicable
arrangements with her and let her go?""Not without due consideration of the matter; no.""You don't think you could hold out some hope that the thing will
end quickly--something that would give me a reasonable excuse for
softening down the pain of it to the family?""I would be perfectly willing to do anything which would take away
the edge of this thing for the family, but the truth's the truth, and
I can't see any room for equivocation between you and me.As I've said
before, these relationships are involved with things which make it
impossible to discuss them--unfair to me, unfair to the woman.No
one can see how they are to be handled, except the people that are in
them, and even they can't always see.I'd be a damned dog to stand up
here and give you my word to do anything except the best I can."Lester stopped, and now Robert rose and paced the floor again, only
to come back after a time and say, "You don't think there's anything
to be done just at present?""Very well, then, I expect I might as well be going.I don't know
that there's anything else we can talk about.""Won't you stay and take lunch with me?I think I might manage to
get down to the hotel if you'll stay.""I believe I can make that one
o'clock train for Cincinnati.They stood before each other now, Lester pale and rather flaccid,
Robert clear, wax-like, well-knit, and shrewd, and one could see the
difference time had already made.Robert was the clean, decisive man,
Lester the man of doubts.Robert was the spirit of business energy and
integrity embodied, Lester the spirit of commercial self-sufficiency,
looking at life with an uncertain eye.Together they made a striking
picture, which was none the less powerful for the thoughts that were
now running through their minds."Well," said the older brother, after a time, "I don't suppose
there is anything more I can say.I had hoped to make you feel just as
we do about this thing, but of course you are your own best judge of
this.If you don't see it now, nothing I could say would make you.It
strikes me as a very bad move on your part though."He said nothing, but his face expressed an
unchanged purpose.Robert turned for his hat, and they walked to the office door
together."I'll put the best face I can on it," said Robert, and walked
out.CHAPTER XXXIV


In this world of ours the activities of animal life seem to be
limited to a plane or circle, as if that were an inherent necessity to
the creatures of a planet which is perforce compelled to swing about
the sun.A fish, for instance, may not pass out of the circle of the
seas without courting annihilation; a bird may not enter the domain of
the fishes without paying for it dearly.From the parasites of the
flowers to the monsters of the jungle and the deep we see clearly the
circumscribed nature of their movements--the emphatic manner in
which life has limited them to a sphere; and we are content to note
the ludicrous and invariably fatal results which attend any effort on
their part to depart from their environment.In the case of man, however, the operation of this theory of
limitations has not as yet been so clearly observed.The laws
governing our social life are not so clearly understood as to permit
of a clear generalization.Still, the opinions, pleas, and judgments
of society serve as boundaries which are none the less real for being
intangible.When men or women err--that is, pass out from the
sphere in which they are accustomed to move--it is not as if the
bird had intruded itself into the water, or the wild animal into the
haunts of man.People may do
no more than elevate their eyebrows in astonishment, laugh
sarcastically, lift up their hands in protest.And yet so well defined
is the sphere of social activity that he who departs from it is
doomed.Born and bred in this environment, the individual is
practically unfitted for any other state.He is like a bird accustomed
to a certain density of atmosphere, and which cannot live comfortably
at either higher or lower level.Lester sat down in his easy-chair by the window after his brother
had gone and gazed ruminatively out over the flourishing city.Yonder
was spread out before him life with its concomitant phases of energy,
hope, prosperity, and pleasure, and here he was suddenly struck by a
wind of misfortune and blown aside for the time being--his
prospects and purposes dissipated.Could he continue as cheerily in
the paths he had hitherto pursued?Would not his relations with Jennie
be necessarily affected by this sudden tide of opposition?Was not his
own home now a thing of the past so far as his old easy-going
relationship was concerned?All the atmosphere of unstained affection
would be gone out of it now.That hearty look of approval which used
to dwell in his father's eye--would it be there any longer?Robert, his relations with the manufactory, everything that was a part
of his old life, had been affected by this sudden intrusion of
Louise."It's unfortunate," was all that he thought to himself, and
therewith turned from what he considered senseless brooding to the
consideration of what, if anything, was to be done."I'm thinking I'd take a run up to Mt.Clemens to-morrow, or
Thursday anyhow, if I feel strong enough," he said to Jennie after he
had returned."I'm not feeling as well as I might.He wanted to get off by himself and think.Jennie packed his
bag for him at the given time, and he departed, but he was in a
sullen, meditative mood.During the week that followed he had ample time to think it all
over, the result of his cogitations being that there was no need of
making a decisive move at present.A few weeks more, one way or the
other, could not make any practical difference.Neither Robert nor any
other member of the family was at all likely to seek another
conference with him.His business relations would necessarily go on as
usual, since they were coupled with the welfare of the manufactory;
certainly no attempt to coerce him would be attempted.But the
consciousness that he was at hopeless variance with his family weighed
upon him."Bad business," he meditated--"bad business."For the period of a whole year this unsatisfactory state of affairs
continued.Lester did not go home for six months; then an important
business conference demanding his presence, he appeared and carried it
off quite as though nothing important had happened.His mother kissed
him affectionately, if a little sadly; his father gave him his
customary greeting, a hearty handshake; Robert, Louise, Amy, Imogene,
concertedly, though without any verbal understanding, agreed to ignore
the one real issue.But the feeling of estrangement was there, and it
persisted.Hereafter his visits to Cincinnati were as few and far
between as he could possibly make them.CHAPTER XXXV


In the meantime Jennie had been going through a moral crisis of her
own.For the first time in her life, aside from the family attitude,
which had afflicted her greatly, she realized what the world thought
of her.She had yielded on two
occasions to the force of circumstances which might have been fought
out differently.If she did not
always have this haunting sense of fear!If she could only make up her
mind to do the right thing!She loved him, but she could leave him, and it would be better for
him.Probably her father would live with her if she went back to
Cleveland.He would honor her for at last taking a decent stand.Yet
the thought of leaving Lester was a terrible one to her--he had
been so good.As for her father, she was not sure whether he would
receive her or not.After the tragic visit of Louise she began to think of saving a
little money, laying it aside as best she could from her allowance.Lester was generous and she had been able to send home regularly
fifteen dollars a week to maintain the family--as much as they
had lived on before, without any help from the outside.She spent
twenty dollars to maintain the table, for Lester required the best of
everything--fruits, meats, desserts, liquors, and what not.The
rent was fifty-five dollars, with clothes and extras a varying sum.Lester gave her fifty dollars a week, but somehow it had all gone.She
thought how she might economize but this seemed wrong.Better go without taking anything, if she were going, was the
thought that came to her.She thought over this week after week, after the advent of Louise,
trying to nerve herself to the point where she could speak or act.Lester was consistently generous and kind, but she felt at times that
he himself might wish it.Since the
scene with Louise it seemed to her that he had been a little
different.If she could only say to him that she was not satisfied
with the way she was living, and then leave.But he himself had
plainly indicated after his discovery of Vesta that her feelings on
that score could not matter so very much to him, since he thought the
presence of the child would definitely interfere with his ever
marrying her.It was her presence he wanted on another basis.And he
was so forceful, she could not argue with him very well.She decided
if she went it would be best to write a letter and tell him why.Then
maybe when he knew how she felt he would forgive her and think nothing
more about it.The condition of the Gerhardt family was not improving.Since
Jennie had left Martha had married.After several years of teaching in
the public schools of Cleveland she had met a young architect, and
they were united after a short engagement.Martha had been always a
little ashamed of her family, and now, when this new life dawned, she
was anxious to keep the connection as slight as possible.She barely
notified the members of the family of the approaching
marriage--Jennie not at all--and to the actual ceremony she
invited only Bass and George.Gerhardt, Veronica, and William resented
the slight.She hoped that life would give her an
opportunity to pay her sister off.William, of course, did not mind
particularly.He was interested in the possibilities of becoming an
electrical engineer, a career which one of his school-teachers had
pointed out to him as being attractive and promising.Jennie heard of Martha's marriage after it was all over, a note
from Veronica giving her the main details.She was glad from one point
of view, but realized that her brothers and sisters were drifting away
from her.A little while after Martha's marriage Veronica and William went to
reside with George, a break which was brought about by the attitude of
Gerhardt himself.Ever since his wife's death and the departure of the
other children he had been subject to moods of profound gloom, from
which he was not easily aroused.Life, it seemed, was drawing to a
close for him, although he was only sixty-five years of age.The
earthly ambitions he had once cherished were gone forever.He saw
Sebastian, Martha, and George out in the world practically ignoring
him, contributing nothing at all to a home which should never have
taken a dollar from Jennie.They
objected to leaving school and going to work, apparently preferring to
live on money which Gerhardt had long since concluded was not being
come by honestly.He was now pretty well satisfied as to the true
relations of Jennie and Lester.At first he had believed them to be
married, but the way Lester had neglected Jennie for long periods, the
humbleness with which she ran at his beck and call, her fear of
telling him about Vesta--somehow it all pointed to the same
thing.Gerhardt had never had sight
of her marriage certificate.Since she was away she might have been
married, but he did not believe it.The real trouble was that Gerhardt had grown intensely morose and
crotchety, and it was becoming impossible for young people to live
with him.They resented the way in which
he took charge of the expenditures after Martha left.He accused them
of spending too much on clothes and amusements, he insisted that a
smaller house should be taken, and he regularly sequestered a part of
the money which Jennie sent, for what purpose they could hardly guess.As a matter of fact, Gerhardt was saving as much as possible in order
to repay Jennie eventually.He thought it was sinful to go on in this
way, and this was his one method, out side of his meager earnings, to
redeem himself.If his other children had acted rightly by him he felt
that he would not now be left in his old age the recipient of charity
from one, who, despite her other good qualities, was certainly not
leading a righteous life.It ended one winter month when George agreed to receive his
complaining brother and sister on condition that they should get
something to do.Gerhardt was nonplussed for a moment, but invited
them to take the furniture and go their way.His generosity shamed
them for the moment; they even tentatively invited him to come and
live with them, but this he would not do.He would ask the foreman of
the mill he watched for the privilege of sleeping in some
out-of-the-way garret.And this would
save him a little money.So in a fit of pique he did this, and there was seen the spectacle
of an old man watching through a dreary season of nights, in a lonely
trafficless neighborhood while the city pursued its gaiety elsewhere.He had a wee small corner in the topmost loft of a warehouse away from
the tear and grind of the factory proper.In the afternoon he would take a little walk, strolling toward the
business center, or out along the banks of the Cuyahoga, or the lake.As a rule his hands were below his back, his brow bent in meditation.He would even talk to himself a little--an occasional "By chops!"or "So it is" being indicative of his dreary mood.At dusk he would
return, taking his stand at the lonely gate which was his post of
duty.His meals he secured at a nearby workingmen's boarding-house,
such as he felt he must have.The nature of the old German's reflections at this time were of a
peculiarly subtle and somber character.What did it all come to after the struggle, and the
worry, and the grieving?People die; you hear
nothing more from them.Yet he continued to hold some strongly dogmatic convictions.He
believed there was a hell, and that people who sinned would go there.He believed that both had
sinned woefully.He believed that the just would be rewarded in
heaven.Sebastian
was a good boy, but he was cold, and certainly indifferent to his
father.Take Martha--she was ambitious, but obviously selfish.Somehow the children, outside of Jennie, seemed self-centered.Bass
walked off when he got married, and did nothing more for anybody.Martha insisted that she needed all she made to live on.George had
contributed for a little while, but had finally refused to help out.Veronica and William had been content to live on Jennie's money so
long as he would allow it, and yet they knew it was not right.His
very existence, was it not a commentary on the selfishness of his
children?Life was truly strange, and dark, and uncertain.Still he
did not want to go and live with any of his children.Actually they
were not worthy of him--none but Jennie, and she was not good.This woeful condition of affairs was not made known to Jennie for
some time.She had been sending her letters to Martha, but, on her
leaving, Jennie had been writing directly to Gerhardt.After
Veronica's departure Gerhardt wrote to Jennie saying that there was no
need of sending any more money.Veronica and William were going to
live with George.He himself had a good place in a factory, and would
live there a little while.He returned her a moderate sum that he had
saved--one hundred and fifteen dollars--with the word that
he would not need it.Jennie did not understand, but as the others did not write, she was
not sure but what it might be all right--her father was so
determined.But by degrees, however, a sense of what it really must
mean overtook her--a sense of something wrong, and she worried,
hesitating between leaving Lester and going to see about her father,
whether she left him or not.Yet if she did not get some work which paid well
they would have a difficult time.If she could get five
or six dollars a week they could live.This hundred and fifteen
dollars which Gerhardt had saved would tide them over the worst
difficulties perhaps.CHAPTER XXXVI


The trouble with Jennie's plan was that it did not definitely take
into consideration Lester's attitude.He did care for her in an
elemental way, but he was hedged about by the ideas of the
conventional world in which he had been reared.To say that he loved
her well enough to take her for better or worse--to legalize her
anomalous position and to face the world bravely with the fact that he
had chosen a wife who suited him--was perhaps going a little too
far, but he did really care for her, and he was not in a mood, at this
particular time, to contemplate parting with her for good.Lester was getting along to that time of life when his ideas of
womanhood were fixed and not subject to change.Thus far, on his own
plane and within the circle of his own associates, he had met no one
who appealed to him as did Jennie.She was gentle, intelligent,
gracious, a handmaiden to his every need; and he had taught her the
little customs of polite society, until she was as agreeable a
companion as he cared to have.He was comfortable, he was
satisfied--why seek further?But Jennie's restlessness increased day by day.She tried writing
out her views, and started a half dozen letters before she finally
worded one which seemed, partially at least, to express her feelings.It was a long letter for her, and it ran as follows:

"Lester dear, When you get this I won't be here, and I want you
not to think harshly of me until you have read it all.I am taking
Vesta and leaving, and I think it is really better that I should.You know when you met me we were very poor,
and my condition was such that I didn't think any good man would ever
want me.When you came along and told me you loved me I was hardly
able to think just what I ought to do.You made me love you, Lester,
in spite of myself."You know I told you that I oughtn't to do anything wrong any more
and that I wasn't good, but somehow when you were near me I couldn't
think just right, and I didn't see just how I was to get away from
you.Papa was sick at home that time, and there was hardly anything in
the house to eat.My brother George
didn't have good shoes, and mamma was so worried.I have often
thought, Lester, if mamma had not been compelled to worry so much she
might be alive to-day.I thought if you liked me and I really liked
you--I love you, Lester--maybe it wouldn't make so much
difference about me.You know you told me right away you would like to
help my family, and I felt that maybe that would be the right thing to
do."Lester, dear, I am ashamed to leave you this way; it seems so mean,
but if you knew how I have been feeling these days you would forgive
me.Oh, I love you, Lester, I do, I do.But for months past--ever
since your sister came--I felt that I was doing wrong, and that I
oughtn't to go on doing it, for I know how terribly wrong it is.It
was wrong for me ever to have anything to do with Senator Brander, but
I was such a girl then--I hardly knew what I was doing.It was
wrong of me not to tell you about Vesta when I first met you, though I
thought I was doing right when I did it.It was terribly wrong of me
to keep her here all that time concealed, Lester, but I was afraid of
you then--afraid of what you would say and do.When your sister
Louise came it all came over me somehow, clearly, and I have never
been able to think right about it since.It can't be right, Lester,
but I don't blame you."I don't ask you to marry me, Lester.I know how you feel about me
and how you feel about your family, and I don't think it would be
right.They would never want you to do it, and it isn't right that I
should ask you.At the same time I know I oughtn't to go on living
this way.Vesta is getting along where she understands everything.She
thinks you are her really truly uncle.I have thought of it all so
much.I have thought a number of times that I would try to talk to you
about it, but you frighten me when you get serious, and I don't seem
to be able to say what I want to.So I thought if I could just write
you this and then go you would understand.I know it's for the best for you and for
me.Please forgive me, Lester, please; and don't
think of me any more.But I love you--oh yes, I
do--and I will never be grateful enough for all you have done for
me.I wish you all the luck that can come to you."P. S. I expect to go to Cleveland with papa.It's best that you
shouldn't."She put this in an envelope, sealed it, and, having hidden it in
her bosom, for the time being, awaited the hour when she could
conveniently take her departure.It was several days before she could bring herself to the actual
execution of the plan, but one afternoon, Lester, having telephoned
that he would not be home for a day or two, she packed some necessary
garments for herself and Vesta in several trunks, and sent for an
expressman.She thought of telegraphing her father that she was
coming; but, seeing he had no home, she thought it would be just as
well to go and find him.George and Veronica had not taken all the
furniture.The major portion of it was in storage--so Gerhard t
had written.She might take that and furnish a little home or flat.She was ready for the end, waiting for the expressman, when the door
opened and in walked Lester.For some unforeseen reason he had changed his mind.He was not in
the least psychic or intuitional, but on this occasion his feelings
had served him a peculiar turn.He had thought of going for a day's
duck-shooting with some friends in the Kankakee Marshes south of
Chicago, but had finally changed his mind; he even decided to go out
to the house early.As he neared the house he felt a little peculiar about coming home
so early; then at the sight of the two trunks standing in the middle
of the room he stood dumfounded.What did it mean--Jennie dressed
and ready to depart?He stared in
amazement, his brown eyes keen in inquiry."Why--why--" she began, falling back."I thought I would go to Cleveland," she replied."Why--why--I meant to tell you, Lester, that I didn't
think I ought to stay here any longer this way.I thought I'd tell you, but I couldn't."What the deuce are you talking about?"There," she said, mechanically pointing to a small center-table
where the letter lay conspicuous on a large book."And you were really going to leave me, Jennie, with just a
letter?"said Lester, his voice hardening a little as he spoke."I
swear to heaven you are beyond me.He tore open the
envelope and looked at the beginning."Better send Vesta from the
room," he suggested.Then she came back and stood there pale and wide-eyed,
looking at the wall, at the trunks, and at him.He shifted his position once or twice, then dropped the
paper on the floor."Well, I'll tell you, Jennie," he said finally, looking at her
curiously and wondering just what he was going to say.Here again was
his chance to end this relationship if he wished.He couldn't feel
that he did wish it, seeing how peacefully things were running.They
had gone so far together it seemed ridiculous to quit now.He truly
loved her--there was no doubt of that.Still he did not want to
marry her--could not very well."You have this thing wrong," he went on slowly."I don't know
what comes over you at times, but you don't view the situation right.I've told you before that I can't marry you--not now, anyhow.There are too many big things involved in this, which you don't know
anything about.But my family has to be
taken into consideration, and the business.You can't see the
difficulties raised on these scores, but I can.Now I don't want you
to leave me.I can't prevent you, of
course.But I don't think you ought to want
to.Jennie, who had been counting on getting away without being seen,
was now thoroughly nonplussed.To have him begin a quiet
argument--a plea as it were.He, Lester, pleading
with her, and she loved him so.She went over to him, and he took her hand."There's really nothing to be gained by
your leaving me at present."Well, how did you expect to get along?""I thought I'd take papa, if he'd come with me--he's alone
now--and get something to do, maybe.""Well, what can you do, Jennie, different from what you ever have
done?You wouldn't expect to be a lady's maid again, would you?"I thought I might get some place as a housekeeper," she suggested.She had been counting up her possibilities, and this was the most
promising idea that had occurred to her."No, no," he grumbled, shaking his head.There's nothing in this whole move of yours except a notion.Why, you
won't be any better off morally than you are right now.It doesn't make any difference, anyhow.I might in the future, but I can't tell anything about that, and
I don't want to promise anything.You're not going to leave me though
with my consent, and if you were going I wouldn't have you dropping
back into any such thing as you're contemplating.I'll make some
provision for you.You don't really want to leave me, do you,
Jennie?"Against Lester's strong personality and vigorous protest Jennie's
own conclusions and decisions went to pieces.Just the pressure of his
hand was enough to upset her."Don't cry, Jennie," he said."This thing may work out better than
you think.You're not
going to leave me any more, are you?""Let things rest as they are," he went on.I'm putting up with some things myself that I ordinarily
wouldn't stand for."He finally saw her restored to comparative calmness, smiling sadly
through her tears."Now you put those things away," he said genially, pointing to the
trunks."Besides, I want you to promise me one thing.""No more concealment of anything, do you hear?No more thinking
things out for yourself, and acting without my knowing anything about
it.If you have anything on your mind, I want you to come out with it.I'll help you solve it, or, if I can't, at least there won't be any
concealment between us.""I know, Lester," she said earnestly, looking him straight in the
eyes."I promise I'll never conceal anything any more--truly I
won't.I've been afraid, but I won't be now."That sounds like what you ought to be," he replied.A few days later, and in consequence of this agreement, the future
of Gerhardt came up for discussion.Jennie had been worrying about him
for several days; now it occurred to her that this was something to
talk over with Lester.Accordingly, she explained one night at dinner
what had happened in Cleveland."I know he is very unhappy there all
alone," she said, "and I hate to think of it.I was going to get him
if I went back to Cleveland.Now I don't know what to do about
it.""Why don't you send him some money?""He won't take any more money from me, Lester," she explained."He
thinks I'm not good--not acting right."He has pretty good reason, hasn't he?""I hate to think of him sleeping in a factory.He's so old and
lonely.""What's the matter with the rest of the family in Cleveland?Won't
they do anything for him?"I think maybe they don't want him, he's so cross," she said
simply."I hardly know what to suggest in that case," smiled Lester."The
old gentleman oughtn't to be so fussy.""I know," she said, "but he's old now, and he has had so much
trouble."Lester ruminated for a while, toying with his fork."I'll tell you
what I've been thinking, Jennie," he said finally."There's no use
living this way any longer, if we're going to stick it out.I've been
thinking that we might take a house out in Hyde Park.It's something
of a run from the office, but I'm not much for this apartment life.You and Vesta would be better off for a yard.In that case you might
bring your father on to live with us.He couldn't do any harm
pottering about; indeed, he might help keep things straight.""Oh, that would just suit papa, if he'd come," she replied."He
loves to fix things, and he'd cut the grass and look after the
furnace.But he won't come unless he's sure I'm married.""I don't know how that could be arranged unless you could show the
old gentleman a marriage certificate.He seems to want something that
can't be produced very well.A steady job he'd have running the
furnace of a country house," he added meditatively.Jennie did not notice the grimness of the jest.She was too busy
thinking what a tangle she had made of her life.Gerhardt would not
come now, even if they had a lovely home to share with him.And yet he
ought to be with Vesta again.She remained lost in a sad abstraction, until Lester, following the
drift of her thoughts, said: "I don't see how it can be arranged.Marriage certificate blanks aren't easily procurable.It's bad
business--a criminal offense to forge one, I believe.I wouldn't
want to be mixed up in that sort of thing.""Oh, I don't want you to do anything like that, Lester.I'm just
sorry papa is so stubborn.When he gets a notion you can't change
him.""Suppose we wait until we get settled after moving," he suggested."Then you can go to Cleveland and talk to him personally.It was
so decent that he rather wished he could help her carry out her
scheme.While not very interesting, Gerhardt was not objectionable to
Lester, and if the old man wanted to do the odd jobs around a big
place, why not?CHAPTER XXXVII


The plan for a residence in Hyde Park was not long in taking shape.After several weeks had passed, and things had quieted down again,
Lester invited Jennie to go with him to South Hyde Park to look for a
house.On the first trip they found something which seemed to suit
admirably--an old-time home of eleven large rooms, set in a lawn
fully two hundred feet square and shaded by trees which had been
planted when the city was young.It was ornate, homelike, peaceful.Jennie was fascinated by the sense of space and country, although
depressed by the reflection that she was not entering her new home
under the right auspices.She had vaguely hoped that in planning to go
away she was bringing about a condition under which Lester might have
come after her and married her.She had
promised to stay, and she would have to make the best of it.She
suggested that they would never know what to do with so much room, but
he waved that aside."We will very likely have people in now and
then," he said."We can furnish it up anyhow, and see how it looks."He had the agent make out a five-year lease, with an option for
renewal, and set at once the forces to work to put the establishment
in order.The house was painted and decorated, the lawn put in order, and
everything done to give the place a trim and satisfactory appearance.There was a large, comfortable library and sitting-room, a big
dining-room, a handsome reception-hall, a parlor, a large kitchen,
serving-room, and in fact all the ground-floor essentials of a
comfortable home.On the second floor were bedrooms, baths, and the
maid's room.It was all very comfortable and harmonious, and Jennie
took an immense pride and pleasure in getting things in order.Immediately after moving in, Jennie, with Lester's permission,
wrote to her father asking him to come to her.She did not say that
she was married, but left it to be inferred.She descanted on the
beauty of the neighborhood, the size of the yard, and the manifold
conveniences of the establishment."It is so very nice," she added,
"you would like it, papa.Vesta is here and goes to school every day.Won't you come and stay with us?It's so much better than living in a
factory.Gerhardt read this letter with a solemn countenance, Was it really
true?Would they be taking a larger house if they were not permanently
united?Well, it was high time--but should he go?He had lived
alone this long time now--should he go to Chicago and live with
Jennie?Her appeal did touch him, but somehow he decided against it.That would be too generous an acknowledgment of the fact that there
had been fault on his side as well as on hers.Jennie was disappointed at Gerhardt's refusal.She talked it over
with Lester, and decided that she would go on to Cleveland and see
him.Accordingly, she made the trip, hunted up the factory, a great
rumbling furniture concern in one of the poorest sections of the city,
and inquired at the office for her father.The clerk directed her to a
distant warehouse, and Gerhardt was informed that a lady wished to see
him.He crawled out of his humble cot and came down, curious as to who
it could be.When Jennie saw him in his dusty, baggy clothes, his hair
gray, his eye brows shaggy, coming out of the dark door, a keen sense
of the pathetic moved her again.He came
toward her, his inquisitorial eye softened a little by his
consciousness of the affection that had inspired her visit."I want you to come home with me, papa," she pleaded yearningly."I
don't want you to stay here any more.I can't think of you living
alone any longer.""So," he said, nonplussed, "that brings you?""Yes," she replied; "Won't you?"I have a good bed," he explained by way of apology for his
state."I know," she replied, "but we have a good home now and Vesta is
there."Yes," she replied, lying hopelessly."I have been married a long
time.She could scarcely look him
in the face, but she managed somehow, and he believed her."Well," he said, "it is time.""Won't you come, papa?"He threw out his hands after his characteristic manner.The urgency
of her appeal touched him to the quick."Yes, I come," he said, and
turned; but she saw by his shoulders what was happening.For answer he walked back into the dark warehouse to get his
things.CHAPTER XXXVIII


Gerhardt, having become an inmate of the Hyde Park home, at once
bestirred himself about the labors which he felt instinctively
concerned him.He took charge of the furnace and the yard, outraged at
the thought that good money should be paid to any outsider when he had
nothing to do.The trees, he declared to Jennie, were in a dreadful
condition.If Lester would get him a pruning knife and a saw he would
attend to them in the spring.In Germany they knew how to care for
such things, but these Americans were so shiftless.Then he wanted
tools and nails, and in time all the closets and shelves were put in
order.He found a Lutheran Church almost two miles away, and declared
that it was better than the one in Cleveland.The pastor, of course,
was a heaven-sent son of divinity.And nothing would do but that Vesta
must go to church with him regularly.Jennie and Lester settled down into the new order of living with
some misgivings; certain difficulties were sure to arise.On the North
Side it had been easy for Jennie to shun neighbors and say nothing.Now they were occupying a house of some pretensions; their immediate
neighbors would feel it their duty to call, and Jennie would have to
play the part of an experienced hostess.She and Lester had talked
this situation over.It might as well be understood here, he said,
that they were husband and wife.Vesta was to be introduced as
Jennie's daughter by her first marriage, her husband, a Mr.Stover
(her mother's maiden name), having died immediately after the child's
birth.Lester, of course, was the stepfather.This particular
neighborhood was so far from the fashionable heart of Chicago that
Lester did not expect to run into many of his friends.He explained to
Jennie the ordinary formalities of social intercourse, so that when
the first visitor called Jennie might be prepared to receive her.Within a fortnight this first visitor arrived in the person of Mrs.Jacob Stendahl, a woman of considerable importance in this particular
section.She lived five doors from Jennie--the houses of the
neighborhood were all set in spacious lawns--and drove up in her
carriage, on her return from her shopping, one afternoon.she asked of Jeannette, the new maid."I think so, mam," answered the girl."Won't you let me have your
card?"The card was given and taken to Jennie, who looked at it
curiously.When Jennie came into the parlor Mrs.Stendahl, a tall dark,
inquisitive-looking woman, greeted her most cordially."I thought I would take the liberty of intruding on you," she said
most winningly.I live on the other side
of the street, some few doors up.Perhaps you have seen the
house--the one with the white stone gate-posts.""Oh, yes indeed," replied Jennie.Kane and I
were admiring it the first day we came out here.""I know of your husband, of course, by reputation.My husband is
connected with the Wilkes Frog and Switch Company."She knew that the latter concern must be
something important and profitable from the way in which Mrs."We have lived here quite a number of years, and I know how you
must feel coming as a total stranger to a new section of the city.I
hope you will find time to come in and see me some afternoon."Indeed I shall," answered Jennie, a little nervously, for the
ordeal was a trying one.Kane is very busy as a rule, but when he is at home I am sure he would
be most pleased to meet you and your husband.""You must both come over some evening," replied Mrs.Jennie smiled her assurances of good-will.Stendahl to the door, and shook hands with her."I'm so glad to find
you so charming," observed Mrs."Oh, thank you," said Jennie flushing a little."I'm sure I don't
deserve so much praise.""Well, now I will expect you some afternoon.Good-by," and she
waved a gracious farewell."That wasn't so bad," thought Jennie as she watched Mrs.Timothy Ballinger--all of whom left
cards, or stayed to chat a few minutes.Jennie found herself taken
quite seriously as a woman of importance, and she did her best to
support the dignity of her position.And, indeed, she did
exceptionally well.She had a
kindly smile and a manner wholly natural; she succeeded in making a
most favorable impression.She explained to her guests that she had
been living on the North Side until recently, that her husband,
Mr.Kane, had long wanted to have a home in Hyde Park, that her father
and daughter were living here, and that Lester was the child's
stepfather.She said she hoped to repay all these nice attentions and
to be a good neighbor.Lester heard about these calls in the evening, for he did not care
to meet these people.Jennie came to enjoy it in a mild way.She liked
making new friends, and she was hoping that something definite could
be worked out here which would make Lester look upon her as a good
wife and an ideal companion.Perhaps, some day, he might really want
to marry her.First impressions are not always permanent, as Jennie was soon to
discover.The neighborhood had accepted her perhaps a little too
hastily, and now rumors began to fly about.Sommerville,
calling on Mrs.Craig, one of Jennie's near neighbors, intimated that
she knew who Lester was--"oh, yes, indeed.You know, my dear,"
she went on, "his reputation is just a little--" she raised her
eyebrows and her hand at the same time."He looks like
such a staid, conservative person.""Oh, no doubt, in a way, he is," went on Mrs."His
family is of the very best.There was some young woman he went
with--so my husband tells me.I don't know whether this is the
one or not, but she was introduced as a Miss Gorwood, or some such
name as that, when they were living together as husband and wife on
the North Side."Craig with her tongue at this
astonishing news.Come to think of it, it must be
the same woman.It
seems to me that there was some earlier scandal in connection with
her--at least there was a child.Whether he married her afterward
or not, I don't know.Anyhow, I understand his family will not have
anything to do with her.""And to think he
should have married her afterward, if he really did.I'm sure you
can't tell with whom you're coming in contact these days, can
you?""Well, it may be," went on her guest, "that this isn't the same
woman after all.She told me they had been living
on the North Side.""Then I'm sure it's the same person.How curious that you should
speak of her!""It is, indeed," went on Mrs.Craig, who was speculating as to what
her attitude toward Jennie should be in the future.There were people who had
seen Jennie and Lester out driving on the North Side, who had been
introduced to her as Miss Gerhardt, who knew what the Kane family
thought.Of course her present position, the handsome house, the
wealth of Lester, the beauty of Vesta--all these things helped to
soften the situation.She was apparently too circumspect, too much the
good wife and mother, too really nice to be angry with; but she had a
past, and that had to be taken into consideration.An opening bolt of the coming storm fell upon Jennie one day when
Vesta, returning from school, suddenly asked: "Mamma, who was my
papa?""His name was Stover, dear," replied her mother, struck at once by
the thought that there might have been some criticism--that some
one must have been saying something.continued Vesta, ignoring the last inquiry, and
interested in clearing up her own identity."Anita Ballinger said I didn't have any papa, and that you weren't
ever married when you had me.She said I wasn't a really, truly girl
at all--just a nobody.Ballinger had called, and Jennie had thought her peculiarly gracious
and helpful in her offer of assistance, and now her little daughter
had said this to Vesta."You mustn't pay any attention to her, dearie," said Jennie at
last.Stover, and you were born
in Columbus.Of course they say
nasty things when they fight--sometimes things they don't really
mean.Just let her alone and don't go near her any more.Then she
won't say anything to you."It was a lame explanation, but it satisfied Vesta for the time
being."I'll slap her if she tries to slap me," she persisted."You mustn't go near her, pet, do you hear?Then she can't try to
slap you," returned her mother."Just go about your studies, and don't
mind her.She can't quarrel with you if you don't let her."Vesta went away leaving Jennie brooding over her words.It is one thing to nurse a single thrust, another to have the wound
opened from time to time by additional stabs.One day Jennie, having
gone to call on Mrs.Hanson Field, who was her immediate neighbor, met
a Mrs.Williston Baker, who was there taking tea.Baker knew of
the Kanes, of Jennie's history on the North Side, and of the attitude
of the Kane family.She was a thin, vigorous, intellectual woman,
somewhat on the order of Mrs.Bracebridge, and very careful of her
social connections.Field a woman of
the same rigid circumspectness of attitude, and when she found Jennie
calling there she was outwardly calm but inwardly irritated.Field, introducing her guests with a
smiling countenance."Indeed," she went on freezingly."I've heard a great deal about
Mrs.--" accenting the word "Mrs.--Lester Kane."Field, ignoring Jennie completely, and started
an intimate conversation in which Jennie could have no possible share.Jennie stood helplessly by, unable to formulate a thought which would
be suitable to so trying a situation.Baker soon announced her
departure, although she had intended to stay longer."I can't remain
another minute," she said; "I promised Mrs.Neil that I would stop in
to see her to-day.I'm sure I've bored you enough already as it
is."She walked to the door, not troubling to look at Jennie until she
was nearly out of the room.Then she looked in her direction, and gave
her a frigid nod."We meet such curious people now and again," she observed finally
to her hostess as she swept away.Field did not feel able to defend Jennie, for she herself was
in no notable social position, and was endeavoring, like every other
middle-class woman of means, to get along.Williston Baker, who was socially so much more important than
Jennie.She came back to where Jennie was sitting, smiling
apologetically, but she was a little bit flustered.Jennie was out of
countenance, of course.Presently she excused herself and went home.She had been cut deeply by the slight offered her, and she felt that
Mrs.Field realized that she had made a mistake in ever taking her up.There would be no additional exchange of visits there--that she
knew.The old hopeless feeling came over her that her life was a
failure.It couldn't be made right, or, if it could, it wouldn't be.Lester was not inclined to marry her and put her right.Time went on and matters remained very much as they were.To look
at this large house, with its smooth lawn and well grown trees, its
vines clambering about the pillars of the veranda and interlacing
themselves into a transparent veil of green; to see Gerhardt pottering
about the yard, Vesta coming home from school, Lester leaving in the
morning in his smart trap--one would have said that here is peace
and plenty, no shadow of unhappiness hangs over this charming
home.And as a matter of fact existence with Lester and Jennie did run
smoothly.It is true that the neighbors did not call any more, or only
a very few of them, and there was no social life to speak of; but the
deprivation was hardly noticed; there was so much in the home life to
please and interest.Vesta was learning to play the piano, and to play
quite well.Jennie was a charming figure
in blue, lavender, and olive-green house-gowns as she went about her
affairs, sewing, dusting, getting Vesta off to school, and seeing that
things generally were put to rights.Gerhardt busied himself about his
multitudinous duties, for he was not satisfied unless he had his hands
into all the domestic economies of the household.One of his
self-imposed tasks was to go about the house after Lester, or the
servants, turning out the gas-jets or electric-light bulbs which might
accidentally have been left burning.Again, Lester's expensive clothes, which he carelessly threw aside
after a few month's use, were a source of woe to the thrifty old
German.Moreover, he grieved over splendid shoes discarded because of
a few wrinkles in the leather or a slightly run down heel or sole.Gerhardt was for having them repaired, but Lester answered the old
man's querulous inquiry as to what was wrong "with them shoes" by
saying that they weren't comfortable any more.No
good can come of anything like that, It will mean want one of these
days.""He can't help it, papa," Jennie excused."That's the way he was
raised."These Americans, they know nothing of
economy.Then they would know
what a dollar can do."Lester heard something of this through Jennie, but he only smiled.Another grievance was Lester's extravagant use of matches.He had
the habit of striking a match, holding it while he talked, instead of
lighting his cigar, and then throwing it away.Sometimes he would
begin to light a cigar two or three minutes before he would actually
do so, tossing aside match after match.There was a place out in one
corner of the veranda where he liked to sit of a spring or summer
evening, smoking and throwing away half-burned matches.Jennie would
sit with him, and a vast number of matches would be lit and flung out
on the lawn.At one time, while engaged in cutting the grass, Gerhardt
found, to his horror, not a handful, but literally boxes of
half-burned match-sticks lying unconsumed and decaying under the
fallen blades.He gathered up
this damning evidence in a newspaper and carried it back into the
sitting-room where Jennie was sewing.That man,
he has no more sense of economy than a--than a--" the right
term failed him."He sits and smokes, and this is the way he uses
matches.Five cents a box they cost--five cents.How can a man
hope to do well and carry on like that, I like to know."Lester is extravagant," she
said.At least they should be
burned in the furnace.He would have used them as lighters for his own
pipe, sticking them in the fire to catch a blaze, only old newspapers
were better, and he had stacks of these--another evidence of his
lord and master's wretched, spendthrift disposition.It was a sad
world to work in.Still he fought
as valiantly as he could against waste and shameless extravagance.He would wear the same suit of
black--cut down from one of Lester's expensive investments of
years before--every Sunday for a couple of years.Lester's shoes,
by a little stretch of the imagination, could be made to seem to fit,
and these he wore.His old ties also--the black ones--they
were fine.If he could have cut down Lester's shirts he would have
done so; he did make over the underwear, with the friendly aid of the
cook's needle.Lester's socks, of course, were just right.There was
never any expense for Gerhardt's clothing.The remaining stock of Lester's discarded clothing--shoes,
shirts, collars, suits, ties, and what not--he would store away
for weeks and months, and then, in a sad and gloomy frame of mind, he
would call in a tailor, or an old-shoe man, or a ragman, and dispose
of the lot at the best price he could.He learned that all second-hand
clothes men were sharks; that there was no use in putting the least
faith in the protests of any rag dealer or old-shoe man.They all claimed to be very poor, when as a matter of fact they
were actually rolling in wealth.Gerhardt had investigated these
stories; he had followed them up; he had seen what they were doing
with the things he sold them."They offer me ten cents for a pair of
shoes, and then I see them hanging out in front of their places marked
two dollars.They could afford to give me a
dollar."It was only to her that he complained, for he could
expect no sympathy from' Lester.So far as his own meager store of
money was concerned, he gave the most of it to his beloved church,
where he was considered to be a model of propriety, honesty,
faith--in fact, the embodiment of all the virtues.And so, for all the ill winds that were beginning to blow socially,
Jennie was now leading the dream years of her existence.Lester, in
spite of the doubts which assailed him at times as to the wisdom of
his career, was invariably kind and considerate, and he seemed to
enjoy his home life.she would ask when he came in of an
evening.he would answer, and pinch her chin or cheek.She would follow him in while Jeannette, always alert, would take
his coat and hat.In the winter-time they would sit in the library
before the big grate-fire.In the spring, summer, or fall Lester
preferred to walk out on the porch, one corner of which commanded a
sweeping view of the lawn and the distant street, and light his
before-dinner cigar.Jennie would sit on the side of his chair and
stroke his head."Your hair is not getting the least bit thin, Lester;
aren't you glad?"she would say; or, "Oh, see how your brow is
wrinkled now.You didn't change your tie, mister,
this morning."Oh, I forgot," he would answer, or he would cause the wrinkles to
disappear, or laughingly predict that he would soon be getting bald if
he wasn't so now.In the drawing-room or library, before Vesta and Gerhardt, she was
not less loving, though a little more circumspect.She loved odd
puzzles like pigs in clover, the spider's hole, baby billiards, and
the like.He would work by
the hour, if necessary, to make a difficult puzzle come right.Jennie
was clever at solving these mechanical problems.Sometimes she would
have to show him the right method, and then she would be immensely
pleased with herself.At other times she would stand behind him
watching, her chin on his shoulder, her arms about his neck.He seemed
not to mind--indeed, he was happy in the wealth of affection she
bestowed.Her cleverness, her gentleness, her tact created an
atmosphere which was immensely pleasing; above all her youth and
beauty appealed to him.It made him feel young, and if there was one
thing Lester objected to, it was the thought of drying up into an
aimless old age."I want to keep young, or die young," was one of his
pet remarks; and Jennie came to understand.She was glad that she was
so much younger now for his sake.Another pleasant feature of the home life was Lester's steadily
increasing affection for Vesta.The child would sit at the big table
in the library in the evening conning her books, while Jennie would
sew, and Gerhardt would read his interminable list of German Lutheran
papers.It grieved the old man that Vesta should not be allowed to go
to a German Lutheran parochial school, but Lester would listen to
nothing of the sort."We'll not have any thick-headed German training
in this," he said to Jennie, when she suggested that Gerhardt had
complained."The public schools are good enough for any child.There were really some delightful hours among the four.Lester
liked to take the little seven-year-old school-girl between his knees
and tease her.He liked to invert the so-called facts of life, to
propound its paradoxes, and watch how the child's budding mind took
them.he would ask; and being informed that it was
"what we drink," he would stare and say, "That's so, but what is it?Don't they teach you any better than that?""Well, it is what we drink, isn't it?""The fact that we drink it doesn't explain what it is," he would
retort."You ask your teacher what water is"; and then he would leave
her with this irritating problem troubling her young soul.Food, china, her dress, anything was apt to be brought back to its
chemical constituents, and he would leave her to struggle with these
dark suggestions of something else back of the superficial appearance
of things until she was actually in awe of him.She had a way of
showing him how nice she looked before she started to school in the
morning, a habit that arose because of his constant criticism of her
appearance.He wanted her to look smart, he insisted on a big bow of
blue ribbon for her hair, he demanded that her shoes be changed from
low quarter to high boots with the changing character of the seasons'
and that her clothing be carried out on a color scheme suited to her
complexion and disposition."That child's light and gay by disposition.Don't put anything
somber on her," he once remarked.Jennie had come to realize that he must be consulted in this, and
would say, "Run to your papa and show him how you look."Vesta would come and turn briskly around before him, saying,
"See."He grew so proud of her that on Sundays and some week-days when
they drove he would always have her in between them.He insisted that
Jennie send her to dancing-school, and Gerhardt was beside himself
with rage and grief."Such
devil's fol-de-rol.To make a no-good
out of her--a creature to be ashamed of?""Oh no, papa," replied Jennie.A fine lot he knows about what is good
for a child.A card-player, a whisky-drinker!""Now, hush, papa; I won't have you talk like that," Jennie would
reply warmly."He's a good man, and you know it."When Lester was near he said nothing, and
Vesta could wind him around her finger."Oh you," she would say, pulling at his arm or rubbing his grizzled
cheek.There was no more fight in Gerhardt when Vesta did this.He
lost control of himself--something welled up and choked his
throat."Yes, I know how you do," he would exclaim.It was noticeable, however, that she did not have to stop unless
she herself willed it.Gerhardt adored the child, and she could do
anything with him; he was always her devoted servitor.CHAPTER XXXIX


During this period the dissatisfaction of the Kane family with
Lester's irregular habit of life grew steadily stronger.That it could
not help but become an open scandal, in the course of time, was
sufficiently obvious to them.People
seemed to understand in a wise way, though nothing was ever said
directly.Kane senior could scarcely imagine what possessed his son to
fly in the face of conventions in this manner.If the woman had been
some one of distinction--some sorceress of the stage, or of the
world of art, or letters, his action would have been explicable if not
commendable, but with this creature of very ordinary capabilities, as
Louise had described her, this putty-faced nobody--he could not
possibly understand it.Lester was his son, his favorite son; it was too bad that he had
not settled down in the ordinary way.Look at the women in Cincinnati
who knew him and liked him.Why in the
name of common sense had he not married her?She was good looking,
sympathetic, talented.The old man grieved bitterly, and then, by
degrees, he began to harden.It seemed a shame that Lester should
treat him so.It wasn't natural, or justifiable, or decent.Archibald
Kane brooded over it until he felt that some change ought to be
enforced, but just what it should be he could not say.Lester was his
own boss, and he would resent any criticism of his actions.Certain changes helped along an approaching denouement.Louise
married not many months after her very disturbing visit to Chicago,
and then the home property was fairly empty except for visiting
grandchildren.Lester did not attend the wedding, though he was
invited.Kane died, making a readjustment of
the family will necessary.Lester came home on this occasion, grieved
to think he had lately seen so little of his mother--that he had
caused her so much pain--but he had no explanation to make.His
father thought at the time of talking to him, but put it off because
of his obvious gloom.He went back to Chicago, and there were more
months of silence.Kane's death and Louise's marriage, the father went to
live with Robert, for his three grandchildren afforded him his
greatest pleasure in his old age.The business, except for the final
adjustment which would come after his death, was in Robert's hands.The latter was consistently agreeable to his sisters and their
husbands and to his father, in view of the eventual control he hoped
to obtain.He was not a sycophant in any sense of the word, but a
shrewd, cold business man, far shrewder than his brother gave him
credit for.He was already richer than any two of the other children
put together, but he chose to keep his counsel and to pretend modesty
of fortune.He realized the danger of envy, and preferred a Spartan
form of existence, putting all the emphasis on inconspicuous but very
ready and very hard cash.While Lester was drifting Robert was
working--working all the time.Robert's scheme for eliminating his brother from participation in
the control of the business was really not very essential, for his
father, after long brooding over the details of the Chicago situation,
had come to the definite conclusion that any large share of his
property ought not to go to Lester.Obviously, Lester was not so
strong a man as he had thought him to be.Of the two brothers, Lester
might be the bigger intellectually or
sympathetically--artistically and socially there was no
comparison--but Robert got commercial results in a silent,
effective way.If Lester was not going to pull himself together at
this stage of the game, when would he?Better leave his property to
those who would take care of it.Archibald Kane thought seriously of
having his lawyer revise his will in such a way that, unless Lester
should reform, he would be cut off with only a nominal income.But he
decided to give Lester one more chance--to make a plea, in fact,
that he should abandon his false way of living, and put himself on a
sound basis before the world.Old
Archibald wrote Lester that he would like to have a talk with him at
his convenience, and within the lapse of thirty-six hours Lester was
in Cincinnati."I thought I'd have one more talk with you, Lester, on a subject
that's rather difficult for me to bring up," began the elder Kane."Yes, I know," replied Lester, calmly."I used to think, when I was much younger that my son's matrimonial
ventures would never concern me, but I changed my views on that score
when I got a little farther along.I began to see through my business
connections how much the right sort of a marriage helps a man, and
then I got rather anxious that my boys should marry well.I used to
worry about you, Lester, and I'm worrying yet.This recent connection
you've made has caused me no end of trouble.It worried your mother up
to the very last.Don't you think you
have gone far enough with it?What
it is in Chicago I don't know, but it can't be a secret.That can't
help the house in business there.The
whole thing has gone on so long that you have injured your prospects
all around, and yet you continue."I suppose because I love her," Lester replied."You can't be serious in that," said his father."If you had loved
her, you'd have married her in the first place.Surely you wouldn't
take a woman and live with her as you have with this woman for years,
disgracing her and yourself, and still claim that you love her.You
may have a passion for her, but it isn't love.""How do you know I haven't married her?"He
wanted to see how his father would take to that idea.The old gentleman propped himself up on his
arms and looked at him."No, I'm not," replied Lester, "but I might be.I can't believe a man of your intelligence would do a thing like that,
Lester.Why, you've lived in open adultery
with her for years, and now you talk of marrying her.Why, in heaven's
name, if you were going to do anything like that, didn't you do it in
the first place?Disgrace your parents, break your mother's heart,
injure the business, become a public scandal, and then marry the cause
of it?"Don't get excited, father," said Lester quickly."We won't get
anywhere that way.She's not a bad woman, and
I wish you wouldn't talk about her as you do."I know enough," insisted old Archibald, determinedly."I know that
no good woman would act as she has done.Why, man, she's after your
money.It's as plain as the nose on your
face.""Father," said Lester, his voice lowering ominously, "why do you
talk like that?You wouldn't know her from
Adam's off ox.Louise comes down here and gives an excited report, and
you people swallow it whole.She isn't as bad as you think she is, and
I wouldn't use the language you're using about her if I were you.You're doing a good woman an injustice, and you won't, for some
reason, be fair."Is it
fair to me, to your family, to your dead mother to take a woman of the
streets and live with her?Is it--"

"Stop now, father," exclaimed Lester, putting up his hand.You're talking about the woman
that I'm living with--that I may marry.I love you, but I won't
have you saying things that aren't so.She isn't a woman of the
streets.You know, as well as you know anything, that I wouldn't take
up with a woman of that kind.We'll have to discuss this in a calmer
mood, or I won't stay here.But I won't
listen to any such language as that."In spite of his opposition, he
respected his son's point of view.He sat back in his chair and stared
at the floor."No, we've moved out to Hyde Park."Well, that's a God's blessing.""I didn't say that," replied his son.exclaimed his father, his anger bubbling again.How do you
suppose I can seriously contemplate entrusting any share of my fortune
to a man who has so little regard for what the world considers as
right and proper?Why, Lester, this carriage business, your family,
your personal reputation appear to be as nothing at all to you.I
can't understand what has happened to your pride.It seems like some
wild, impossible fancy.""It's pretty hard to explain, father, and I can't do it very well.I simply know that I'm in this affair, and that I'm bound to see it
through.I'm not prepared now to say what I'll do.Old Archibald merely shook his head disapprovingly."You've made a bad mess of this, Lester," he said finally.But I suppose you are determined to go your way.Nothing
that I have said appears to move you.""Well, I warn you, then, that, unless you show some consideration
for the dignity of your family and the honor of your position it will
make a difference in my will.I can't go on countenancing this thing,
and not be a party to it morally and every other way.You can leave her, or you can marry her.You certainly ought to do one
or the other.If you leave her, everything will be all right.You can
make any provision for her you like.I'll
gladly pay whatever you agree to.You will share with the rest of the
children, just as I had planned.If you marry her it will make a
difference.I'm doing what I think is my bounden duty.Now you think
that over and let me know."He felt that
his father probably meant what he said, but how could he leave Jennie,
and justify himself to himself?The old gentleman loved him even now--he could see
it.Lester felt troubled and distressed; this attempt at coercion
irritated him.The idea--he, Lester Kane, being made to do such a
thing to throw Jennie down.Old Archibald saw that he had let fly a telling bullet."Well," said Lester finally, "there's no use of our discussing it
any further now--that's certain, isn't it?I can't say what I'll
do.Lester was sorry for the world's
attitude and for his father's keen feeling about the affair.Kane
senior was sorry for his son, but he was determined to see the thing
through.He wasn't sure whether he had converted Lester or not, but he
was hopeful."Good-by, father," said Lester, holding out his hand."I think I'll
try and make that two-ten train.There isn't anything else you wanted
to see me about?"The old man sat there after Lester had gone, thinking deeply.What a foolhardy
persistence in evil and error!He
was the one to control a business.It was a long time
before he stirred.And still, in the bottom of his heart, his erring
son continued to appeal to him.CHAPTER XL


Lester returned to Chicago.He realized that he had offended his
father seriously, how seriously he could not say.In all his personal
relations with old Archibald he had never seen him so worked up.But
even now Lester did not feel that the breach was irreparable; he
hardly realized that it was necessary for him to act decisively if he
hoped to retain his father's affection and confidence.As for the
world at large, what did it matter how much people talked or what they
said.People turn so
quickly from weakness or the shadow of it.To get away from
failure--even the mere suspicion of it--that seems to be a
subconscious feeling with the average man and woman; we all avoid
non-success as though we fear that it may prove contagious.Lester was
soon to feel the force of this prejudice.One day Lester happened to run across Berry Dodge, the millionaire
head of Dodge, Holbrook & Kingsbury, a firm that stood in the
dry-goods world, where the Kane Company stood in the carriage world.Dodge had been one of Lester's best friends.He knew him as intimately
as he knew Henry Bracebridge, of Cleveland, and George Knowles, of
Cincinnati.He visited at his handsome home on the North Shore Drive,
and they met constantly in a business and social way.But since Lester
had moved out to Hyde Park, the old intimacy had lapsed.Now they came
face to face on Michigan Avenue near the Kane building."Why, Lester, I'm glad to see you again," said Dodge.He extended a formal hand, and seemed just a little cool."I hear
you've gone and married since I saw you.""No, nothing like that," replied Lester, easily, with the air of
one who prefers to be understood in the way of the world sense."Why so secret about it, if you have?"asked Dodge, attempting to
smile, but with a wry twist to the corners of his mouth.He was trying
to be nice, and to go through a difficult situation gracefully."We
fellows usually make a fuss about that sort of thing."Well," said Lester, feeling the edge of the social blade that was
being driven into him, "I thought I'd do it in a new way.I'm not much
for excitement in that direction, anyhow.""It is a matter of taste, isn't it?""You're living in the city, of course?"And he
deftly changed the subject before waving him a perfunctory
farewell.Lester missed at once the inquiries which a man like Dodge would
have made if he had really believed that he was married.Under
ordinary circumstances his friend would have wanted to know a great
deal about the new Mrs.There would have been all those little
familiar touches common to people living on the same social plane.Dodge would have asked Lester to bring his wife over to see them,
would have definitely promised to call.Nothing of the sort happened,
and Lester noticed the significant omission.It was the same with the Burnham Moores, the Henry Aldriches, and a
score of other people whom he knew equally well.Apparently they all
thought that he had married and settled down.They were interested to
know where he was living, and they were rather disposed to joke him
about being so very secretive on the subject, but they were not
willing to discuss the supposed Mrs.He was beginning to see
that this move of his was going to tell against him notably.One of the worst stabs--it was the cruelest because, in a way,
it was the most unintentional--he received from an old
acquaintance, Will Whitney, at the Union Club.Lester was dining there
one evening, and Whitney met him in the main reading-room as he was
crossing from the cloak-room to the cigar-stand.The latter was a
typical society figure, tall, lean, smooth-faced, immaculately garbed,
a little cynical, and to-night a little the worse for liquor.he called out, "what's this talk about a menage
of yours out in Hyde Park?How are you going
to explain all this to your wife when you get married?""I don't have to explain it," replied Lester irritably."Why should
you be so interested in my affairs?You're not living in a stone
house, are you?"that's pretty good now, isn't it?You didn't marry
that little beauty you used to travel around with on the North Side,
did you?You didn't, now,
did you?""Cut it out, Whitney," said Lester roughly."Pardon, Lester," said the other aimlessly, but sobering.Eight whisky-sours
straight in the other room there.I'll talk to you some time
when I'm all right.I'm a little loose,
that's right.Lester could not get over that cacophonous "ha!It cut him,
even though it came from a drunken man's mouth."That little beauty
you used to travel with on the North Side.You didn't marry her, did
you?"He quoted Whitney's impertinences resentfully.He had never endured anything like this
before--he, Lester Kane.Certainly he was
paying dearly for trying to do the kind thing by Jennie.CHAPTER XLI


But worse was to follow.The American public likes gossip about
well-known people, and the Kanes were wealthy and socially prominent.The report was that Lester, one of its principal heirs, had married a
servant girl.What a
piquant morsel for the newspapers!Very soon the paragraphs began to
appear.A small society paper, called the South Side Budget,
referred to him anonymously as "the son of a famous and wealthy
carriage manufacturer of Cincinnati," and outlined briefly what it
knew of the story.----" it went on, sagely, "not
so much is known, except that she once worked in a well-known
Cleveland society family as a maid and was, before that, a
working-girl in Columbus, Ohio.After such a picturesque love-affair
in high society, who shall say that romance is dead?"He did not take the paper, but some kind soul
took good care to see that a copy was marked and mailed to him.It
irritated him greatly, for he suspected at once that it was a scheme
to blackmail him.But he did not know exactly what to do about it.He
preferred, of course, that such comments should cease, but he also
thought that if he made any effort to have them stopped he might make
matters worse.Naturally, the paragraph in the
Budget attracted the attention of other newspapers.It sounded
like a good story, and one Sunday editor, more enterprising than the
others, conceived the notion of having this romance written up.A
full-page Sunday story with a scare-head such as "Sacrifices Millions
for His Servant Girl Love," pictures of Lester, Jennie, the house at
Hyde Park, the Kane manufactory at Cincinnati, the warehouse on
Michigan Avenue--certainly, such a display would make a
sensation.The Kane Company was not an advertiser in any daily or
Sunday paper.If Lester had been
forewarned he might have put a stop to the whole business by putting
an advertisement in the paper or appealing to the publisher.He did
not know, however, and so was without power to prevent the
publication.The editor made a thorough job of the business.Local
newspaper men in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus were instructed
to report by wire whether anything of Jennie's history was known in
their city.The Bracebridge family in Cleveland was asked whether
Jennie had ever worked there.A garbled history of the Gerhardts was
obtained from Columbus.Jennie's residence on the North Side, for
several years prior to her supposed marriage, was discovered and so
the whole story was nicely pieced together.It was not the idea of the
newspaper editor to be cruel or critical, but rather complimentary.All the bitter things, such as the probable illegitimacy of Vesta, the
suspected immorality of Lester and Jennie in residing together as man
and wife, the real grounds of the well-known objections of his family
to the match, were ignored.The idea was to frame up a Romeo and
Juliet story in which Lester should appear as an ardent,
self-sacrificing lover, and Jennie as a poor and lovely working-girl,
lifted to great financial and social heights by the devotion of her
millionaire lover.An exceptional newspaper artist was engaged to make
scenes depicting the various steps of the romance and the whole thing
was handled in the most approved yellow-journal style.There was a
picture of Lester obtained from his Cincinnati photographer for a
consideration; Jennie had been surreptitiously "snapped" by a staff
artist while she was out walking.And so, apparently out of a clear sky, the story
appeared--highly complimentary, running over with sugary phrases,
but with all the dark, sad facts looming up in the background.Jennie
did not see it at first.Lester came across the page accidentally, and
tore it out.He was stunned and chagrined beyond words."To think the
damned newspaper would do that to a private citizen who was quietly
minding his own business!"He went out of the house, the
better to conceal his deep inward mortification.He avoided the more
populous parts of the town, particularly the down-town section, and
rode far out on Cottage Grove Avenue to the open prairie.He wondered,
as the trolley-car rumbled along, what his friends were
thinking--Dodge, and Burnham Moore, and Henry Aldrich, and the
others.The best he could do was to put a
brave face on it and say nothing, or else wave it off with an
indifferent motion of the hand.One thing was sure--he would
prevent further comment.He returned to the house calmer, his
self-poise restored, but he was eager for Monday to come in order that
he might get in touch with his lawyer, Mr.Watson it was soon agreed between the two men that it would be
foolish to take any legal action.It was the part of wisdom to let the
matter drop."But I won't stand for anything more," concluded
Lester."I'll attend to that," said the lawyer, consolingly."It's amazing--this damned country of ours!""A man with a little money hasn't any more privacy than a
public monument.""A man with a little money," said Mr.Watson, "is just like a cat
with a bell around its neck.Every rat knows exactly where it is and
what it is doing.""That's an apt simile," assented Lester, bitterly.Jennie knew nothing of this newspaper story for several days.Lester felt that he could not talk it over, and Gerhardt never read
the wicked Sunday newspapers.Finally, one of Jennie's neighborhood
friends, less tactful than the others, called her attention to the
fact of its appearance by announcing that she had seen it."Why, I hadn't seen it," she said."Are you
sure it was about us?"I'll send Marie over with it when
I get back."I wish you would," she said, weakly.She was wondering where they had secured her picture, what the
article said.Above all, she was dismayed to think of its effect upon
Lester.Why had he not spoken to her about
it?The neighbor's daughter brought over the paper, and Jennie's heart
stood still as she glanced at the title-page.There it all
was--uncompromising and direct.How dreadfully conspicuous the
headline--"This Millionaire Fell in Love With This Lady's Maid,"
which ran between a picture of Lester on the left and Jennie on the
right.There was an additional caption which explained how Lester, son
of the famous carriage family of Cincinnati, had sacrificed great
social opportunity and distinction to marry his heart's desire.Below
were scattered a number of other pictures--Lester addressing
Jennie in the mansion of Mrs.Bracebridge, Lester standing with her
before an imposing and conventional-looking parson, Lester driving
with her in a handsome victoria, Jennie standing beside the window of
an imposing mansion (the fact that it was a mansion being indicated by
most sumptuous-looking hangings) and gazing out on a very modest
working-man's cottage pictured in the distance.Jennie felt as though
she must die for very shame.She did not so much mind what it meant to
her, but Lester, Lester, how must he feel?Now they
would have another club with which to strike him and her.She tried to
keep calm about it, to exert emotional control, but again the tears
would rise, only this time they were tears of opposition to defeat.She did not want to be hounded this way.Why couldn't the world help her,
instead of seeking to push her down?CHAPTER XLII


The fact that Lester had seen this page was made perfectly clear to
Jennie that evening, for he brought it home himself, having concluded,
after mature deliberation, that he ought to.He had told her once that
there was to be no concealment between them, and this thing, coming so
brutally to disturb their peace, was nevertheless a case in point.He
had decided to tell her not to think anything of it--that it did
not make much difference, though to him it made all the difference in
the world.The effect of this chill history could never be undone.The
wise--and they included all his social world and many who were
not of it--could see just how he had been living.The article
which accompanied the pictures told how he had followed Jennie from
Cleveland to Chicago, how she had been coy and distant and that he had
to court her a long time to win her consent.This was to explain their
living together on the North Side.Lester realized that this was an
asinine attempt to sugar-coat the true story and it made him angry.Still he preferred to have it that way rather than in some more brutal
vein.He took the paper out of his pocket when he arrived at the
house, spreading it on the library table.Jennie, who was close by,
watched him, for she knew what was coming."Here's something that will interest you, Jennie," he said dryly,
pointing to the array of text and pictures."I've already seen it, Lester," she said wearily.Stendahl
showed it to me this afternoon."Rather high-flown description of my attitude, isn't it?I didn't
know I was such an ardent Romeo.""I'm awfully sorry, Lester," said Jennie, reading behind the dry
face of humor the serious import of this affair to him.She had long
since learned that Lester did not express his real feeling, his big
ills in words.He was inclined to jest and make light of the
inevitable, the inexorable.This light comment merely meant "this
matter cannot be helped, so we will make the best of it.""Oh, don't feel badly about it," he went on."It isn't anything
which can be adjusted now.We just
happen to be in the limelight.""I understand," said Jennie, coming over to him."I'm sorry,
though, anyway."Dinner was announced a moment later and the incident
was closed.But Lester could not dismiss the thought that matters were getting
in a bad way.His father had pointed it out to him rather plainly at
the last interview, and now this newspaper notoriety had capped the
climax.He might as well abandon his pretension to intimacy with his
old world.It would have none of him, or at least the more
conservative part of it would not.There were a few bachelors, a few
gay married men, some sophisticated women, single and married, who saw
through it all and liked him just the same, but they did not make
society.He was virtually an outcast, and nothing could save him but
to reform his ways; in other words, he must give up Jennie once and
for all.The thought was painful to
him--objectionable in every way.Jennie was growing in mental
acumen.She was beginning to see things quite as clearly as he did.She was not a cheap, ambitious, climbing creature.She was a big woman
and a good one.It would be a shame to throw her down, and besides she
was good-looking.He was forty-six and she was twenty-nine; and she
looked twenty-four or five.It is an exceptional thing to find beauty,
youth, compatibility, intelligence, your own point of
view--softened and charmingly emotionalized--in another.He
had made his bed, as his father had said.It was only a little while after this disagreeable newspaper
incident that Lester had word that his father was quite ill and
failing; it might be necessary for him to go to Cincinnati at any
moment.Pressure of work was holding him pretty close when the news
came that his father was dead.Lester, of course, was greatly shocked
and grieved, and he returned to Cincinnati in a retrospective and
sorrowful mood.His father had been a great character to him--a
fine and interesting old gentleman entirely aside from his
relationship to him as his son.He remembered him now dandling him
upon his knee as a child, telling him stories of his early life in
Ireland, and of his subsequent commercial struggle when he was a
little older, impressing the maxims of his business career and his
commercial wisdom on him as he grew to manhood.Old Archibald had been
radically honest.It was to him that Lester owed his instincts for
plain speech and direct statement of fact."Never lie," was
Archibald's constant, reiterated statement."Never try to make a thing
look different from what it is to you.It's the breath of
life--truth--it's the basis of real worth, while commercial
success--it will make a notable character of any one who will
stick to it."He admired his father intensely
for his rigid insistence on truth, and now that he was really gone he
felt sorry.He wished he might have been spared to be reconciled to
him.He half fancied that old Archibald would have liked Jennie if he
had known her.He did not imagine that he would ever have had the
opportunity to straighten things out, although he still felt that
Archibald would have liked her.When he reached Cincinnati it was snowing, a windy, blustery snow.The traffic of the city
had a muffled sound.When he stepped down from the train he was met by
Amy, who was glad to see him in spite of all their past differences.Of all the girls she was the most tolerant.Lester put his arms about
her, and kissed her."It seems like old times to see you, Amy," he said, "your coming to
meet me this way.Well,
poor father, his time had to come.Still, he lived to see everything
that he wanted to see.I guess he was pretty well satisfied with the
outcome of his efforts.""Yes," replied Amy, "and since mother died he was very lonely."They rode up to the house in kindly good feeling, chatting of old
times and places.All the members of the immediate family, and the
various relatives, were gathered in the old family mansion.Lester
exchanged the customary condolences with the others, realizing all the
while that his father had lived long enough.He had had a successful
life, and had fallen like a ripe apple from the tree.Lester looked at
him where he lay in the great parlor, in his black coffin, and a
feeling of the old-time affection swept over him.He smiled at the
clean-cut, determined, conscientious face."The old gentleman was a big man all the way through," he said to
Robert, who was present."We won't find a better figure of a man
soon.""We will not," said his brother, solemnly.After the funeral it was decided to read the will at once.Louise's
husband was anxious to return to Buffalo; Lester was compelled to be
in Chicago.A conference of the various members of the family was
called for the second day after the funeral, to be held at the offices
of Messrs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien, counselors of the late
manufacturer.As Lester rode to the meeting he had the feeling that his father
had not acted in any way prejudicial to his interests.It had not been
so very long since they had had their last conversation; he had been
taking his time to think about things, and his father had given him
time.He always felt that he had stood well with the old gentleman,
except for his alliance with Jennie.His business judgment had been
valuable to the company.Why should there be any discrimination
against him?When they reached the offices of the law firm, Mr.O'Brien, a
short, fussy, albeit comfortable-looking little person, greeted all
the members of the family and the various heirs and assigns with a
hearty handshake.He had been personal counsel to Archibald Kane for
twenty years.He knew his whims and idiosyncrasies, and considered
himself very much in the light of a father confessor.He liked all the
children, Lester especially."Now I believe we are all here," he said, finally, extracting a
pair of large horn reading-glasses from his coat pocket and looking
sagely about.I will
just read the will without any preliminary remarks."He turned to his desk, picked up a paper lying upon it, cleared his
throat, and began.It was a peculiar document, in some respects, for it began with all
the minor bequests; first, small sums to old employees, servants, and
friends.It then took up a few institutional bequests, and finally
came to the immediate family, beginning with the girls.Imogene, as a
faithful and loving daughter was left a sixth of the stock of the
carriage company and a fourth of the remaining properties of the
deceased, which roughly aggregated (the estate--not her share)
about eight hundred thousand dollars.Amy and Louise were provided for
in exactly the same proportion.The grandchildren were given certain
little bonuses for good conduct, when they should come of age.Then it
took up the cases of Robert and Lester."Owing to certain complications which have arisen in the affairs of
my son Lester," it began, "I deem it my duty to make certain
conditions which shall govern the distribution of the remainder of my
property, to wit: One-fourth of the stock of the Kane Manufacturing
Company and one-fourth of the remainder of my various properties,
real, personal, moneys, stocks and bonds, to go to my beloved son
Robert, in recognition of the faithful performance of his duty, and
one-fourth of the stock of the Kane Manufacturing Company and the
remaining fourth of my various properties, real, personal, moneys,
stocks and bonds, to be held in trust by him for the benefit of his
brother Lester, until such time as such conditions as may hereinafter
be set forth shall have been complied with.And it is my wish and
desire that my children shall concur in his direction of the Kane
Manufacturing Company, and of such other interests as are entrusted to
him, until such time as he shall voluntarily relinquish such control,
or shall indicate another arrangement which shall be better."His cheeks changed color, but he did
not move.It appeared that he was
not even mentioned separately.The conditions "hereinafter set forth" dealt very fully with his
case, however, though they were not read aloud to the family at the
time, Mr.O'Brien stating that this was in accordance with their
father's wish.Lester learned immediately afterward that he was to
have ten thousand a year for three years, during which time he had the
choice of doing either one of two things: First, he was to leave
Jennie, if he had not already married her, and so bring his life into
moral conformity with the wishes of his father.In this event Lester's
share of the estate was to be immediately turned over to him.Secondly, he might elect to marry Jennie, if he had not already done
so, in which case the ten thousand a year, specifically set aside to
him for three years, was to be continued for life--but for his
life only.Jennie was not to have anything of it after his death.The
ten thousand in question represented the annual interest on two
hundred shares of L. S. and M. S. stock which were also to be held in
trust until his decision had been reached and their final disposition
effected.If Lester refused to marry Jennie, or to leave her, he was
to have nothing at all after the three years were up.At Lester's
death the stock on which his interest was drawn was to be divided pro
rata among the surviving members of the family.If any heir or assign
contested the will, his or her share was thereby forfeited
entirely.It was astonishing to Lester to see how thoroughly his father had
taken his case into consideration.He half suspected, on reading these
conditions, that his brother Robert had had something to do with the
framing of them, but of course he could not be sure.Robert had not
given any direct evidence of enmity.he demanded of O'Brien, a little later."Well, we all had a hand in it," replied O'Brien, a little
shamefacedly."It was a very difficult document to draw up.Kane, there was no budging your father.He has
come very near defeating his own wishes in some of these clauses.Of
course, you know, we had nothing to do with its spirit.I hated very much to have to do it."During the reading of the will Lester had sat as stolid as an
ox.He got up after a time, as did the others, assuming an air of
nonchalance.Robert, Amy, Louise and Imogene all felt shocked, but not
exactly, not unqualifiedly regretful."I think the old gentleman has been a little rough in this," said
Robert, who had been sitting next him."I certainly did not expect him
to go as far as that.So far as I am concerned some other arrangement
would have been satisfactory."Imogene, Amy, and Louise were anxious to be consolatory, but they
did not know what to say."I
don't think papa acted quite right, Lester," ventured Amy, but Lester
waved her away almost gruffly.He figured out, as he stood there, what his income would be in case
he refused to comply with his father's wishes.Two hundred shares of
L. S. and M. S., in open market, were worth a little over one thousand
each.They yielded from five to six per cent., sometimes more,
sometimes less.At this rate he would have ten thousand a year, not
more.The family gathering broke up, each going his way, and Lester
returned to his sister's house.He wanted to get out of the city
quickly, gave business as an excuse to avoid lunching with any one,
and caught the earliest train back to Chicago.So this was how much his father really cared for him!He, Lester Kane, ten thousand a year, for only three
years, and then longer only on condition that he married Jennie!"Ten
thousand a year," he thought, "and that for three years!To think he should have done that to
me!"CHAPTER XLIII


This attempt at coercion was the one thing which would definitely
set Lester in opposition to his family, at least for the time being.He had realized clearly enough of late that he had made a big mistake;
first in not having married Jennie, thus avoiding scandal; and in the
second place in not having accepted her proposition at the time when
she wanted to leave him; There were no two ways about it, he had made
a mess of this business.He could not afford to lose his fortune
entirely.He did not have enough money of his own.Jennie was unhappy,
he could see that.Did he want
to accept the shabby ten thousand a year, even if he were willing to
marry her?Finally, did he want to lose Jennie, to have her go out of
his life once and for all?He could not make up his mind; the problem
was too complicated.When Lester returned to his home, after the funeral, Jennie saw at
once that something was amiss with him, something beyond a son's
natural grief for his father's death was weighing upon his spirits.She tried to draw near to him
sympathetically, but his wounded spirit could not be healed so easily.When hurt in his pride he was savage and sullen--he could have
struck any man who irritated him.She watched him interestedly,
wishing to do something for him, but he would not give her his
confidence.He grieved, and she could only grieve with him.Days passed, and now the financial situation which had been created
by his father's death came up for careful consideration.The factory
management had to be reorganized.Robert would have to be made
president, as his father wished.Lester's own relationship to the
business would have to come up for adjudication.Unless he changed his
mind about Jennie, he was not a stockholder.As a matter of fact, he
was not anything.To continue to be secretary and treasurer, it was
necessary that he should own at least one share of the company's
stock.Would the other members of the family care to do
anything which would infringe on Robert's prerogatives under the will?They were all rather unfriendly to Lester at present, and he realized
that he was facing a ticklish situation.The solution was--to get
rid of Jennie.If he did that he would not need to be begging for
stock.If he didn't, he was flying in the face of his father's last
will and testament.He turned the matter over in his mind slowly and
deliberately.He could quite see how things were coming out.He must
abandon either Jennie or his prospects in life.Despite Robert's assertion, that so far as he was concerned another
arrangement would have been satisfactory, he was really very well
pleased with the situation; his dreams were slowly nearing completion.Robert had long had his plans perfected, not only for a thorough
reorganization of the company proper, but for an extension of the
business in the direction of a combination of carriage companies.If
he could get two or three of the larger organizations in the East and
West to join with him, selling costs could be reduced, over-production
would be avoided, and the general expenses could be materially scaled
down.Through a New York representative, he had been picking up stock
in outside carriage companies for some time and he was almost ready to
act.In the first place he would have himself elected president of the
Kane Company, and since Lester was no longer a factor, he could select
Amy's husband as vice-president, and possibly some one other than
Lester as secretary and treasurer.Under the conditions of the will,
the stock and other properties set aside temporarily for Lester, in
the hope that he would come to his senses, were to be managed and
voted by Robert.His father had meant, obviously, that he, Robert,
should help him coerce his brother.He did not want to appear mean,
but this was such an easy way.It gave him a righteous duty to
perform.Lester must come to his senses or he must let Robert run the
business to suit himself.Lester, attending to his branch duties in Chicago, foresaw the
drift of things.He realized now that he was permanently out of the
company, a branch manager at his brother's sufferance, and the thought
irritated him greatly.Nothing had been said by Robert to indicate
that such a change had taken place--things went on very much as
before--but Robert's suggestions were now obviously law.Lester
was really his brother's employee at so much a year.There came a time, after a few weeks, when he felt as if he could
not stand this any longer.Hitherto he had been a free and independent
agent.The approaching annual stockholder's meeting which hitherto had
been a one-man affair and a formality, his father doing all the
voting, would be now a combination of voters, his brother presiding,
his sisters very likely represented by their husbands, and he not
there at all.It was going to be a great come-down, but as Robert had
not said anything about offering to give or sell him any stock which
would entitle him to sit as a director or hold any official position
in the company, he decided to write and resign.That would bring
matters to a crisis.It would show his brother that he felt no desire
to be under obligations to him in any way or to retain anything which
was not his--and gladly so--by right of ability and the
desire of those with whom he was associated.If he wanted to move back
into the company by deserting Jennie he would come in a very different
capacity from that of branch manager.He dictated a simple,
straight-forward business letter, saying:

"DEAR ROBERT, I know the time is drawing near when the company
must be reorganized under your direction.Not having any stock, I am
not entitled to sit as a director, or to hold the joint position of
secretary and treasurer.I want you to accept this letter as formal
notice of my resignation from both positions, and I want to have your
directors consider what disposition should be made of this position
and my services.I am not anxious to retain the branch-managership as
a branch-managership merely; at the same time I do not want to do
anything which will embarrass you in your plans for the future.You
see by this that I am not ready to accept the proposition laid down in
father's will--at least, not at present.I would like a definite
understanding of how you feel in this matter."Yours,

"LESTER."Robert, sitting in his office at Cincinnati, considered this letter
gravely.It was like his brother to come down to "brass tacks."If
Lester were only as cautious as he was straightforward and direct,
what a man he would be!But there was no guile in the man--no
subtlety.He would never do a snaky thing--and Robert knew, in
his own soul, that to succeed greatly one must."You have to be
ruthless at times--you have to be subtle," Robert would say to
himself."Why not face the facts to yourself when you are playing for
big stakes?"He would, for one, and he did.Robert felt that although Lester was a tremendously decent fellow
and his brother, he wasn't pliable enough to suit his needs.He was
too outspoken, too inclined to take issue.If Lester yielded to his
father's wishes, and took possession of his share of the estate, he
would become, necessarily, an active partner in the affairs of the
company.Lester would be a barrier in Robert's path.He much preferred that Lester should hold
fast to Jennie, for the present at least, and so be quietly shelved by
his own act.After long consideration, Robert dictated a politic letter.He
hadn't made up his mind yet just what he wanted to do.He did not know
what his sisters' husbands would like.For his part, he would be very glad to have Lester remain as
secretary and treasurer, if it could be arranged.Perhaps it would be
better to let the matter rest for the present.What did Robert mean by beating around the bush?He
knew well enough how it could be arranged.One share of stock would be
enough for Lester to qualify.Robert was afraid of him--that was
the basic fact.Well, he would not retain any branch-managership,
depend on that.Lester accordingly wrote
back, saying that he had considered all sides, and had decided to look
after some interests of his own, for the time being.If Robert could
arrange it, he would like to have some one come on to Chicago and take
over the branch agency.In a few
days came a regretful reply, saying that Robert was awfully sorry, but
that if Lester was determined he did not want to interfere with any
plans he might have in view.Imogene's husband, Jefferson Midgely, had
long thought he would like to reside in Chicago.He could undertake
the work for the time being.Evidently Robert was making the best of a very
subtle situation.Robert knew that he, Lester, could sue and tie
things up, and also that he would be very loath to do so.The
newspapers would get hold of the whole story.This matter of his
relationship to Jennie was in the air, anyhow.He could best solve the
problem by leaving her.CHAPTER XLIV


For a man of Lester's years--he was now forty-six--to be
tossed out in the world without a definite connection, even though he
did have a present income (including this new ten thousand) of fifteen
thousand a year, was a disturbing and discouraging thing.He realized
now that, unless he made some very fortunate and profitable
arrangements in the near future, his career was virtually at an end.That would give him the ten thousand
for the rest of his life, but it would also end his chance of getting
his legitimate share of the Kane estate.Again, he might sell out the
seventy-five thousand dollars' worth of moderate interest-bearing
stocks, which now yielded him about five thousand, and try a practical
investment of some kind--say a rival carriage company.But did he
want to jump in, at this stage of the game, and begin a running fight
on his father's old organization?Moreover, it would be a hard row to
hoe.There was the keenest rivalry for business as it was, with the
Kane Company very much in the lead.Lester's only available capital
was his seventy-five thousand dollars.Did he want to begin in a
picayune, obscure way?It took money to get a foothold in the carriage
business as things were now.The trouble with Lester was that, while blessed with a fine
imagination and considerable insight, he lacked the ruthless,
narrow-minded insistence on his individual superiority which is a
necessary element in almost every great business success.To be a
forceful figure in the business world means, as a rule, that you must
be an individual of one idea, and that idea the God-given one that
life has destined you for a tremendous future in the particular field
you have chosen.It means that one thing, a cake of soap, a new
can-opener, a safety razor, or speed-accelerator, must seize on your
imagination with tremendous force, burn as a raging flame, and make
itself the be-all and end-all of your existence.As a rule, a man
needs poverty to help him to this enthusiasm, and youth.The thing he
has discovered, and with which he is going to busy himself, must be
the door to a thousand opportunities and a thousand joys.Happiness
must be beyond or the fire will not burn as brightly as it
might--the urge will not be great enough to make a great
success.Lester did not possess this indispensable quality of enthusiasm.Life had already shown him the greater part of its so-called joys.He
saw through the illusions that are so often and so noisily labeled
pleasure.Money, of course, was essential, and he had already had
money--enough to keep him comfortably.Certainly he could not
comfortably contemplate the thought of sitting by and watching other
people work for the rest of his days.In the end he decided that he would bestir himself and look into
things.He was, as he said to himself, in no hurry; he was not going
to make a mistake.He would first give the trade, the people who were
identified with v he manufacture and sale of carriages, time to
realize that he was out of the Kane Company, for the time being,
anyhow, and open to other connections.So he announced that he was
leaving the Kane Company and going to Europe, ostensibly for a rest.He had never been abroad, and Jennie, too, would enjoy it.Vesta could
be left at home with Gerhardt and a maid, and he and Jennie would
travel around a bit, seeing what Europe had to show.He wanted to
visit Venice and Baden-Baden, and the great watering-places that had
been recommended to him.Cairo and Luxor and the Parthenon had always
appealed to his imagination.After he had had his outing he could come
back and seriously gather up the threads of his intentions.The spring after his father died, he put his plan into execution.He had wound up the work of the warerooms and with a pleasant
deliberation had studied out a tour.He made Jennie his confidante,
and now, having gathered together their traveling comforts they took a
steamer from New York to Liverpool.After a few weeks in the British
Isles they went to Egypt.From there they came back, through Greece
and Italy, into Austria and Switzerland, and then later, through
France and Paris, to Germany and Berlin.Lester was diverted by the
novelty of the experience and yet he had an uncomfortable feeling that
he was wasting his time.Great business enterprises were not built by
travelers, and he was not looking for health.Jennie, on the other hand, was transported by what she saw, and
enjoyed the new life to the full.Before Luxor and Karnak--places
which Jennie had never dreamed existed--she learned of an older
civilization, powerful, complex, complete.Millions of people had
lived and died here, believing in other gods, other forms of
government, other conditions of existence.For the first time in her
life Jennie gained a clear idea of how vast the world is.Now from
this point of view--of decayed Greece, of fallen Rome, of
forgotten Egypt, she saw how pointless are our minor difficulties, our
minor beliefs.Her father's Lutheranism--it did not seem so
significant any more; and the social economy of Columbus,
Ohio--rather pointless, perhaps.Her mother had worried so of
what people--her neighbors--thought, but here were dead
worlds of people, some bad, some good.Lester explained that their
differences in standards of morals were due sometimes to climate,
sometimes to religious beliefs, and sometimes to the rise of peculiar
personalities like Mohammed.Lester liked to point out how small
conventions bulked in this, the larger world, and vaguely she began to
see.Admitting that she had been bad--locally it was important,
perhaps, but in the sum of civilization, in the sum of big forces,
what did it all amount to?They would be dead after a little while,
she and Lester and all these people.Did anything matter except
goodness--goodness of heart?CHAPTER XLV


It was while traveling abroad that Lester came across, first at the
Carlton in London and later at Shepheards in Cairo, the one girl,
before Jennie, whom it might have been said he truly
admired--Letty Pace.He had not seen her for a long time, and she
had been Mrs.Malcolm Gerald for nearly four years, and a charming
widow for nearly two years more.Malcolm Gerald had been a wealthy
man, having amassed a fortune in banking and stock-brokering in
Cincinnati, and he had left Mrs.She was
the mother of one child, a little girl, who was safely in charge of a
nurse and maid at all times, and she was invariably the picturesque
center of a group of admirers recruited from every capital of the
civilized world.Letty Gerald was a talented woman, beautiful,
graceful, artistic, a writer of verse, an omnivorous reader, a student
of art, and a sincere and ardent admirer of Lester Kane.In her day she had truly loved him, for she had been a wise
observer of men and affairs, and Lester had always appealed to her as
a real man.He was so sane, she thought, so calm.He was always
intolerant of sham, and she liked him for it.He was inclined to wave
aside the petty little frivolities of common society conversation, and
to talk of simple and homely things.Many and many a time, in years
past, they had deserted a dance to sit out on a balcony somewhere, and
talk while Lester smoked.He had argued philosophy with her, discussed
books, described political and social conditions in other
cities--in a word, he had treated her like a sensible human
being, and she had hoped and hoped and hoped that he would propose to
her.More than once she had looked at his big, solid head with its
short growth of hardy brown hair, and wished that she could stroke it.It was a hard blow to her when he finally moved away to Chicago; at
that time she knew nothing of Jennie, but she felt instinctively that
her chance of winning him was gone.Then Malcolm Gerald, always an ardent admirer, proposed for
something like the sixty-fifth time, and she took him.She did not
love him, but she was getting along, and she had to marry some one.He
was forty-four when he married her, and he lived only four
years--just long enough to realize that he had married a
charming, tolerant, broad-minded woman.Gerald was a rich widow, sympathetic, attractive, delightful in
her knowledge of the world, and with nothing to do except to live and
to spend her money.She was not inclined to do either indifferently.She had long since
had her ideal of a man established by Lester.These whipper-snappers
of counts, earls, lords, barons, whom she met in one social world and
another (for her friendship and connections had broadened notably with
the years), did not interest her a particle.She was terribly weary of
the superficial veneer of the titled fortune-hunter whom she met
abroad.A good judge of character, a student of men and manners, a
natural reasoner along sociologic and psychologic lines, she saw
through them and through the civilization which they represented."I
could have been happy in a cottage with a man I once knew out in
Cincinnati," she told one of her titled women friends who had been an
American before her marriage."He was the biggest, cleanest, sanest
fellow.If he had proposed to me I would have married him if I had had
to work for a living myself."He was comfortably rich, but that did not make
any difference to me."It would have made a difference in the long run," said the
other."You misjudge me," replied Mrs."I waited for him for a
number of years, and I know."Lester had always retained pleasant impressions and kindly memories
of Letty Pace, or Mrs.He had been fond of her
in a way, very fond.He had asked himself
that question time and again.She would have made him an ideal wife,
his father would have been pleased, everybody would have been
delighted.Instead he had drifted and drifted, and then he had met
Jennie; and somehow, after that, he did not want her any more.Now
after six years of separation he met her again.She was vaguely aware he had had some sort of an
affair--she had heard that he had subsequently married the woman
and was living on the South Side.She did not know of the loss of his
fortune.She ran across him first in the Carlton one June evening.The
windows were open, and the flowers were blooming everywhere, odorous
with that sense of new life in the air which runs through the world
when spring comes back.For the moment she was a little beside
herself.Something choked in her throat; but she collected herself and
extended a graceful arm and hand.It seems truly like a breath
of spring to see you again.Kane, but
I'm delighted to see your husband.I'm ashamed to say how many years
it is, Lester, since I saw you last!I feel quite old when I think of
it.Why, Lester, think; it's been all of six or seven years!And I've
been married and had a child, and poor Mr.Gerald has died, and oh,
dear, I don't know what all hasn't happened to me.""You don't look it," commented Lester, smiling.He was pleased to
see her again, for they had been good friends.She liked him
still--that was evident, and he truly liked her.She was glad to see this old friend of Lester's.This woman, trailing a magnificent yellow lace train over pale,
mother-of-pearl satin, her round, smooth arms bare to the shoulder,
her corsage cut low and a dark red rose blowing at her waist, seemed
to her the ideal of what a woman should be.She liked looking at
lovely women quite as much as Lester; she enjoyed calling his
attention to them, and teasing him, in the mildest way, about their
charms."Wouldn't you like to run and talk to her, Lester, instead of
to me?"she would ask when some particularly striking or beautiful
woman chanced to attract her attention.Lester would examine her
choice critically, for he had come to know that her judge of feminine
charms was excellent."Oh, I'm pretty well off where I am," he would
retort, looking into her eyes; or, jestingly, "I'm not as young as I
used to be, or I'd get in tow of that.""What would you do if I really should?""Why, Lester, I wouldn't do anything.You'd come back to me,
maybe."But if you felt that you wanted to, I wouldn't
try to stop you.I wouldn't expect to be all in all to one man, unless
he wanted me to be.""Where do you get those ideas, Jennie?"he asked her once, curious
to test the breadth of her philosophy."Oh, I don't know, why?""They're so broad, so good-natured, so charitable.They're not
common, that's sure.""Why, I don't think we ought to be selfish, Lester.Some women think differently, I know, but a man and a woman ought
to want to live together, or they ought not to--don't you think?It doesn't make so much difference if a man goes off for a little
while--just so long as he doesn't stay--if he wants to come
back at all."Lester smiled, but he respected her for the sweetness of her point
of view--he had to.To-night, when she saw this woman so eager to talk to Lester, she
realized at once that they must have a great deal in common to talk
over; whereupon she did a characteristic thing."Won't you excuse me
for a little while?""I left some things uncared
for in our rooms.She went away, remaining in her room as long as she reasonably
could, and Lester and Letty fell to discussing old times in earnest.He recounted as much of his experiences as he deemed wise, and Letty
brought the history of her life up to date."Now that you're safely
married, Lester," she said daringly, "I'll confess to you that you
were the one man I always wanted to have propose to me--and you
never did.""Maybe I never dared," he said, gazing into her superb black eyes,
and thinking that perhaps she might know that he was not married.He
felt that she had grown more beautiful in every way.She seemed to him
now to be an ideal society figure-perfection itself--gracious,
natural, witty, the type of woman who mixes and mingles well, meeting
each new-comer upon the plane best suited to him or her."Anyhow, I allow you some credit."Jennie has her good points," he replied simply.Yes, I suppose I'm happy--as happy as any one
can be who sees life as it is.You know I'm not troubled with many
illusions.""Not any, I think, kind sir, if I know you.""Very likely, not any, Letty; but sometimes I wish I had a few.Really, I look on my life as a kind of
failure, you know, in spite of the fact that I'm almost as rich as
Croesus--not quite.I think he had some more than I have.""What talk from you--you, with your beauty and talent, and
money--good heavens!"Travel, talk, shoo away silly
fortune-hunters.Oh, dear, sometimes I get so tired!"In spite of Jennie, the old feeling came
back.They were as
comfortable together as old married people, or young lovers.She looked at him, and her eyes fairly spoke."We'll have to brace up and talk of
other things."Yes, I know," she replied, and turned on Jennie a radiant
smile.Jennie felt a faint sense of misgiving.She thought vaguely that
this might be one of Lester's old flames.This was the kind of woman
he should have chosen--not her.She was suited to his station in
life, and he would have been as happy--perhaps happier.Then she put away the uncomfortable thought;
pretty soon she would be getting jealous, and that would be
contemptible.Gerald continued to be most agreeable in her attitude toward
the Kanes.She invited them the next day to join her on a drive
through Rotten Row.There was a dinner later at Claridge's, and then
she was compelled to keep some engagement which was taking her to
Paris.She bade them both an affectionate farewell, and hoped that
they would soon meet again.She was envious, in a sad way, of Jennie's
good fortune.Lester had lost none of his charm for her.If anything,
he seemed nicer, more considerate, more wholesome.She wished
sincerely that he were free.And Lester--subconsciously
perhaps--was thinking the same thing.No doubt because of the fact that she was thinking of it, he had
been led over mentally all of the things which might have happened if
he had married her.They were so congenial now, philosophically,
artistically, practically.There was a natural flow of conversation
between them all the time, like two old comrades among men.She knew
everybody in his social sphere, which was equally hers, but Jennie did
not.They could talk of certain subtle characteristics of life in a
way which was not possible between him and Jennie, for the latter did
not have the vocabulary.Her ideas did not flow as fast as those of
Mrs.Jennie had actually the deeper, more comprehensive,
sympathetic, and emotional note in her nature, but she could not show
it in light conversation.Actually she was living the thing she was,
and that was perhaps the thing which drew Lester to her.Just now, and
often in situations of this kind, she seemed at a disadvantage, and
she was.It seemed to Lester for the time being as if Mrs.Gerald
would perhaps have been a better choice after all--certainly as
good, and he would not now have this distressing thought as to his
future.In the
gardens about the hotel they suddenly encountered her, or rather
Lester did, for he was alone at the time, strolling and smoking."Well, this is good luck," he exclaimed.I didn't know I was coming until last
Thursday.You know I
wondered where you might be.Then I remembered that you said you were
going to Egypt."In her bath, I fancy, at this moment.This warm weather makes
Jennie take to water.Letty was in light blue silk, with
a blue and white parasol held daintily over her shoulder, and looked
very pretty.she suddenly ejaculated, "I wonder sometimes
what I am to do with myself.I think
I'll go back to the States to live."I haven't
any one to marry now--that I want."She glanced at Lester
significantly, then looked away."Oh, you'll find some one eventually," he said, somewhat awkwardly."You can't escape for long--not with your looks and money."she inquired lightly, thinking of a ball
which was to be given at the hotel that evening.He had danced so well
a few years before."Now, Lester, you don't mean to say that you have gone and
abandoned that last charming art.Come to
think of it, I suppose that is my fault.I haven't thought of dancing
in some time."It occurred to him that he hadn't been going to functions of any
kind much for some time.The opposition his entanglement had generated
had put a stop to that."Come and dance with me to-night."I'll have to think about that," replied Lester.Dancing will probably go hard with me at my time of
life.""Oh, hush, Lester," replied Mrs.Mercy alive, you'd think you were an old
man!""Pshaw, that simply makes us more attractive," replied his old
flame.CHAPTER XLVI


That night after dinner the music was already sounding in the
ball-room of the great hotel adjacent to the palm-gardens when Mrs.Gerald found Lester smoking on one of the verandas with Jennie by his
side.The latter was in white satin and white slippers, her hair lying
a heavy, enticing mass about her forehead and ears.Lester was
brooding over the history of Egypt, its successive tides or waves of
rather weak-bodied people; the thin, narrow strip of soil along either
side of the Nile that had given these successive waves of population
sustenance; the wonder of heat and tropic life, and this hotel with
its modern conveniences and fashionable crowd set down among ancient,
soul-weary, almost despairing conditions.He and Jennie had looked
this morning on the pyramids.They had taken a trolley to the Sphinx!They had watched swarms of ragged, half-clad, curiously costumed men
and boys moving through narrow, smelly, albeit brightly colored, lanes
and alleys."It all seems such a mess to me," Jennie had said at one place.I like it, but somehow they seem tangled
up, like a lot of worms."Lester chuckled, "You're almost right.Life is always mushy and sensual under these conditions.To-night he was brooding over this, the moon shining down into the
grounds with an exuberant, sensuous luster."Well, at last I've found you!""I couldn't
get down to dinner, after all.I've made your husband agree to dance with me, Mrs.Kane," she went on
smilingly.She, like Lester and Jennie, was under the sensuous
influence of the warmth, the spring, the moonlight.There were rich
odors abroad, floating subtly from groves and gardens; from the remote
distance camel-bells were sounding and exotic cries, "Ayah!"as though a drove of strange animals were
being rounded up and driven through the crowded streets."You're welcome to him," replied Jennie pleasantly."You ought to take lessons right away then," replied Lester
genially."I'll do my best to keep you company.I'm not as light on my
feet as I was once, but I guess I can get around.""Oh, I don't want to dance that badly," smiled Jennie."But you two
go on, I'm going up-stairs in a little while, anyway.""Why don't you come sit in the ball-room?I can't do more than a
few rounds.Then we can watch the others," said Lester rising.Gerald in dark wine-colored silk, covered with
glistening black beads, her shapely arms and neck bare, and a flashing
diamond of great size set just above her forehead in her dark hair.Her lips were red, and she had an engaging smile, showing an even row
of white teeth between wide, full, friendly lips.Lester's strong,
vigorous figure was well set off by his evening clothes, he looked
distinguished."That is the woman he should have married," said Jennie to herself
as he disappeared.She fell into a reverie, going over the steps of
her past life.Sometimes it seemed to her now as if she had been
living in a dream.At other times she felt as though she were in that
dream yet.Life sounded in her ears much as this night did.But back of it were
subtleties that shaded and changed one into the other like the
shifting of dreams.Why had
Lester been so eager to follow her?She
thought of her life in Columbus, when she carried coal; to-night she
was in Egypt, at this great hotel, the chatelaine of a suite of rooms,
surrounded by every luxury, Lester still devoted to her.He had
endured so many things for her!Still she felt humble, out of place,
holding handfuls of jewels that did not belong to her.Again she
experienced that peculiar feeling which had come over her the first
time she went to New York with Lester--namely, that this fairy
existence could not endure.She would go back to simple things, to a side street, a poor
cottage, to old clothes.And then as she thought of her home in Chicago, and the attitude of
his friends, she knew it must be so.She would never be received, even
if he married her.She could look into
the charming, smiling face of this woman who was now with Lester, and
see that she considered her very nice, perhaps, but not of Lester's
class.She was saying to herself now no doubt as she danced with
Lester that he needed some one like her.He needed some one who had
been raised in the atmosphere of the things to which he had been
accustomed.He couldn't very well expect to find in her, Jennie, the
familiarity with, the appreciation of the niceties to, which he had
always been accustomed.Her mind had
awakened rapidly to details of furniture, clothing, arrangement,
decorations, manner, forms, customs, but--she was not to the
manner born.If she went away Lester would return to his old world, the world of
the attractive, well-bred, clever woman who now hung upon his arm.The
tears came into Jennie's eyes; she wished, for the moment, that she
might die.Gerald, or sitting out between the waltzes talking over old
times, old places, and old friends.As he looked at Letty he marveled
at her youth and beauty.She was more developed than formerly, but
still as slender and shapely as Diana.She had strength, too, in this
smooth body of hers, and her black eyes were liquid and lusterful."I swear, Letty," he said impulsively, "you're really more
beautiful than ever."You know I do, or I wouldn't say so."Oh, Lester, you bear, can't you allow a woman just a little
coyness?Don't you know we all love to sip our praise, and not be
compelled to swallow it in one great mouthful?"You're such a big, determined,
straightforward boy.They strolled into the garden as the music ceased, and he squeezed
her arm softly.He couldn't help it; she made him feel as if he owned
her.She said to herself, as they sat
looking at the lanterns in the gardens, that if ever he were free, and
would come to her, she would take him.She was almost ready to take
him anyhow--only he probably wouldn't.He was so straight-laced,
so considerate.He wouldn't, like so many other men she knew, do a
mean thing.He
and Jennie were going farther up the Nile in the morning--toward
Karnak and Thebes and the water-washed temples at Phylae.They
would have to start at an unearthly early hour, and he must get to
bed."Yes; we sail from Hamburg on the ninth--the
Fulda.""I may be going back in the fall," laughed Letty."Don't be
surprised if I crowd in on the same boat with you.I'm very unsettled
in my mind.""Come along, for goodness sake," replied Lester."I hope you do....
I'll see you to-morrow before we leave."He paused, and she looked at
him wistfully."Cheer up," he said, taking her hand."You never can tell what life
will do.We sometimes find ourselves right when we thought we were all
wrong."He was thinking that she was sorry to lose him, and he was sorry
that she was not in a position to have what she wanted.As for
himself, he was saying that here was one solution that probably he
would never accept; yet it was a solution.Why had he not seen this
years before?"And yet she wasn't as beautiful then as she is now, nor as wise,
nor as wealthy."But he couldn't be unfaithful to Jennie
nor wish her any bad luck.She had had enough without his willing, and
had borne it bravely.CHAPTER XLVII


The trip home did bring another week with Mrs.Gerald, for after
mature consideration she had decided to venture to America for a
while.Chicago and Cincinnati were her destinations, and she hoped to
see more of Lester.Her presence was a good deal of a surprise to
Jennie, and it started her thinking again.Gerald would marry Lester;
that was certain.As it was--well, the question was a complicated
one.Letty was Lester's natural mate, so far as birth, breeding, and
position went.And yet Jennie felt instinctively that, on the large
human side, Lester preferred her.Perhaps time would solve the
problem; in the mean time the little party of three continued to
remain excellent friends.Gerald went
her way, and Jennie and Lester took up the customary thread of their
existence.On his return from Europe Lester set to work in earnest to find a
business opening.None of the big companies made him any overtures,
principally because he was considered a strong man who was looking for
a control in anything he touched.The nature of his altered fortunes
had not been made public.All the little companies that he
investigated were having a hand-to-mouth existence, or manufacturing a
product which was not satisfactory to him.He did find one company in
a small town in northern Indiana which looked as though it might have
a future.It was controlled by a practical builder of wagons and
carriages--such as Lester's father had been in his day--who,
however, was not a good business man.He was making some small money
on an investment of fifteen thousand dollars and a plant worth, say,
twenty-five thousand.Lester felt that something could be done here if
proper methods were pursued and business acumen exercised.There would never be a great fortune in it.He was thinking of making an offer to the small manufacturer
when the first rumors of a carriage trust reached him.Robert had gone ahead rapidly with his scheme for reorganizing the
carriage trade.He showed his competitors how much greater profits
could be made through consolidation than through a mutually
destructive rivalry.So convincing were his arguments that one by one
the big carriage manufacturing companies fell into line.Within a few
months the deal had been pushed through, and Robert found himself
president of the United Carriage and Wagon Manufacturers' Association,
with a capital stock of ten million dollars, and with assets
aggregating nearly three-fourths of that sum at a forced sale.While all this was going forward Lester was completely in the dark.His trip to Europe prevented him from seeing three or four minor
notices in the newspapers of some of the efforts that were being made
to unite the various carriage and wagon manufactories.He returned to
Chicago to learn that Jefferson Midgely, Imogene's husband, was still
in full charge of the branch and living in Evanston, but because of
his quarrel with his family he was in no position to get the news
direct.Accident brought it fast enough, however, and that rather
irritatingly.The individual who conveyed this information was none other than
Mr.Henry Bracebridge, of Cleveland, into whom he ran at the Union
Club one evening after he had been in the city a month."I hear you're out of the old company," Bracebridge remarked,
smiling blandly."Yes," said Lester, "I'm out.""Oh, I have a deal of my own under consideration, I'm thinking
something of handling an independent concern.""Surely you won't run counter to your brother?He has a pretty good
thing in that combination of his."I hadn't heard of it," said Lester."I've just got
back from Europe.""Well, you want to wake up, Lester," replied Bracebridge."He's got
the biggest thing in your line.The
Lyman-Winthrop Company, the Myer-Brooks Company, the Woods
Company--in fact, five or six of the big companies are all in.Your brother was elected president of the new concern.I dare say he
cleaned up a couple of millions out of the deal."Bracebridge could see that he had given him a vital stab."Well, so long, old man," he exclaimed."When you're in Cleveland
look us up.You know how fond my wife is of you."He strolled away to the smoking-room, but the news took all the
zest out of his private venture.Where would he be with a shabby
little wagon company and his brother president of a carriage trust?Robert could put him out of business in a year.Why, he
himself had dreamed of such a combination as this.It is one thing to have youth, courage, and a fighting spirit to
meet the blows with which fortune often afflicts the talented.It is
quite another to see middle age coming on, your principal fortune
possibly gone, and avenue after avenue of opportunity being sealed to
you on various sides.Jennie's obvious social insufficiency, the
quality of newspaper reputation which had now become attached to her,
his father's opposition and death, the loss of his fortune, the loss
of his connection with the company, his brother's attitude, this
trust, all combined in a way to dishearten and discourage him.He
tried to keep a brave face--and he had succeeded thus far, he
thought, admirably, but this last blow appeared for the time being a
little too much.He went home, the same evening that he heard the
news, sorely disheartened.She realized it, as a matter
of fact, all during the evening that he was away.She felt blue and
despondent herself.When he came home she saw what it
was--something had happened to him.Her first impulse was to say,
"What is the matter, Lester?"but her next and sounder one was to
ignore it until he was ready to speak, if ever.She tried not to let
him see that she saw, coming as near as she might affectionately
without disturbing him."Vesta is so delighted with herself to-day," she volunteered by way
of diversion."That's good," he replied solemnly.She showed me some of her
new dances to-night.You haven't any idea how sweet she looks.""I'm glad of it," he grumbled."I always wanted her to be perfect
in that.It's time she was going into some good girls' school, I
think.""And papa gets in such a rage.She teases him
about it--the little imp.She offered to teach him to dance
to-night.If he didn't love her so he'd box her ears.""I can see that," said Lester, smiling."She's not the least bit disturbed by his storming, either."He was very fond of Vesta, who was now
quite a girl.So Jennie tripped on until his mood was modified a little, and then
some inkling of what had happened came out.It was when they were
retiring for the night."Robert's formulated a pretty big thing in a
financial way since we've been away," he volunteered."Oh, he's gotten up a carriage trust.It's something which will
take in every manufactory of any importance in the country.Bracebridge was telling me that Robert was made president, and that
they have nearly eight millions in capital.""Well, then you won't want to do
much with your new company, will you?""No; there's nothing in that, just now," he said."Later on I fancy
it may be all right.I'll wait and see how this thing comes out.You
never can tell what a trust like that will do."She wished sincerely that she might do
something to comfort him, but she knew that her efforts were useless."Oh, well," she said, "there are so many interesting things in this
world.If I were you I wouldn't be in a hurry to do anything, Lester.She didn't trust herself to say anything more, and he felt that it
was useless to worry.After all, he had an ample income
that was absolutely secure for two years yet.He could have more if he
wanted it.Only his brother was moving so dazzlingly onward, while he
was standing still--perhaps "drifting" would be the better word.It did seem a pity; worst of all, he was beginning to feel a little
uncertain of himself.CHAPTER XLVIII


Lester had been doing some pretty hard thinking, but so far he had
been unable to formulate any feasible plan for his re-entrance into
active life.The successful organization of Robert's carriage trade
trust had knocked in the head any further thought on his part of
taking an interest in the small Indiana wagon manufactory.He could
not be expected to sink his sense of pride and place, and enter a
petty campaign for business success with a man who was so obviously
his financial superior.He had looked up the details of the
combination, and he found that Bracebridge had barely indicated how
wonderfully complete it was.It
would have every little manufacturer by the throat.Should he begin
now in a small way and "pike along" in the shadow of his giant
brother?He would be
running around the country trying to fight a new trust, with his own
brother as his tolerant rival and his own rightful capital arrayed
against him.If not--well, he had his
independent income and the right to come back into the Kane Company if
he wished.It was while Lester was in this mood, drifting, that he received a
visit from Samuel E. Ross, a real estate dealer, whose great, wooden
signs might be seen everywhere on the windy stretches of prairie about
the city.Lester had seen Ross once or twice at the Union Club, where
he had been pointed out as a daring and successful real estate
speculator, and he had noticed his rather conspicuous offices at La
Salle and Washington streets.Ross was a magnetic-looking person of
about fifty years of age, tall, black-bearded, black-eyed, an arched,
wide-nostriled nose, and hair that curled naturally, almost
electrically.Lester was impressed with his lithe, cat-like figure,
and his long, thin, impressive white hands.Ross had a real estate proposition to lay before Mr.Ross admitted fully that he
knew all about Mr.Norman
Yale, of the wholesale grocery firm of Yale, Simpson & Rice, he
had developed "Yalewood."Only within six weeks the last lots in the Ridgewood section of
"Yalewood" had been closed out at a total profit of forty-two per
cent.He went over a list of other deals in real estate which he had
put through, all well-known properties.He admitted frankly that there
were failures in the business; he had had one or two himself.But the
successes far outnumbered the bad speculations, as every one knew.Now
Lester was no longer connected with the Kane Company.He was probably
looking for a good investment, and Mr.Ross had a proposition to lay
before him.Lester consented to listen, and Mr.Ross blinked his
cat-like eyes and started in.The idea was that he and Lester should enter into a one-deal
partnership, covering the purchase and development of a forty-acre
tract of land lying between Fifty-fifth, Seventy-first, Halstead
streets, and Ashland Avenue, on the southwest side.There were
indications of a genuine real estate boom there--healthy,
natural, and permanent.The city was about to pave Fifty-fifth Street.There was a plan to extend the Halstead Street car line far below its
present terminus.The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, which ran near
there, would be glad to put a passenger station on the property.The
initial cost of the land would be forty thousand dollars which they
would share equally.Grading, paving, lighting, tree planting,
surveying would cost, roughly, an additional twenty-five thousand.There would be expenses for advertising--say ten per cent, of the
total investment for two years, or perhaps three--a total of
nineteen thousand five hundred or twenty thousand dollars.All told,
they would stand to invest jointly the sum of ninety-five thousand, or
possibly one hundred thousand dollars, of which Lester's share would
be fifty thousand.The character of the land, its salability, and the likelihood of a
rise in value could be judged by the property adjacent, the sales that
had been made north of Fifty-fifth Street and east of Halstead.Take,
for instance, the Mortimer plot, at Halstead and Fifty-fifth streets,
on the south-east corner.Here was a piece of land that in 1882 was
held at forty-five dollars an acre.In 1886 it had risen to five
hundred dollars an acre, as attested by its sale to a Mr.John L.
Slosson at that time.In 1889, three years later, it had been sold to
Mr.Mortimer for one thousand per acre, precisely the figure at which
this tract was now offered.It could be parceled out into lots fifty
by one hundred feet at five hundred dollars per lot.Ross went on, somewhat boastfully, to explain just how real estate
profits were made.It was useless for any outsider to rush into the
game, and imagine that he could do in a few weeks or years what
trained real estate speculators like himself had been working on for a
quarter of a century.There was something in prestige, something in
taste, something in psychic apprehension.Supposing that they went
into the deal, he, Ross, would be the presiding genius.He had a
trained staff, he controlled giant contractors, he had friends in the
tax office, in the water office, and in the various other city
departments which made or marred city improvements.If Lester would
come in with him he would make him some money--how much he would
not say exactly--fifty thousand dollars at the lowest--one
hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand in all likelihood.Would
Lester let him go into details, and explain just how the scheme could
be worked out?After a few days of quiet cogitation, Lester decided to
accede to Mr.Ross's request; he would look into this thing.CHAPTER XLIX


The peculiarity of this particular proposition was that it had the
basic elements of success.Ross had the experience and the
judgment which were quite capable of making a success of almost
anything he undertook.He was in a field which was entirely familiar.He could convince almost any able man if he could get his ear
sufficiently long to lay his facts before him.Lester was not convinced at first, although, generally speaking, he
was interested in real estate propositions.He
considered it a sound investment providing you did not get too much of
it.He had never invested in any, or scarcely any, solely because he
had not been in a realm where real estate propositions were talked of.As it was he was landless and, in a way, jobless.It was easy
to verify his statements, and he did verify them in several
particulars.There were his signs out on the prairie stretches, and
here were his ads in the daily papers.It seemed not a bad way at all
in his idleness to start and make some money.The trouble with Lester was that he had reached the time where he
was not as keen for details as he had formerly been.All his work in
recent years--in fact, from the very beginning--had been
with large propositions, the purchasing of great quantities of
supplies, the placing of large orders, the discussion of things which
were wholesale and which had very little to do with the minor details
which make up the special interests of the smaller traders of the
world.In the factory his brother Robert had figured the pennies and
nickels of labor-cost, had seen to it that all the little leaks were
shut off.Lester had been left to deal with larger things, and he had
consistently done so.When it came to this particular proposition his
interest was in the wholesale phases of it, not the petty details of
selling.He could not help seeing that Chicago was a growing city, and
that land values must rise.What was now far-out prairie property
would soon, in the course of a few years, be well built-up suburban
residence territory.Scarcely any land that could be purchased now
would fall in value.It might drag in sales or increase, but it
couldn't fall.He knew it of his own
judgment to be true.The several things on which he did not speculate sufficiently were
the life or health of Mr.Ross; the chance that some obnoxious
neighborhood growth would affect the territory he had selected as
residence territory; the fact that difficult money situations might
reduce real estate values--in fact, bring about a flurry of real
estate liquidation which would send prices crashing down and cause the
failure of strong promoters, even such promoters for instance, as Mr.For several months he studied the situation as presented by his new
guide and mentor, and then, having satisfied himself that he was
reasonably safe, decided to sell some of the holdings which were
netting him a beggarly six per cent, and invest in this new
proposition.The first cash outlay was twenty thousand dollars for the
land, which was taken over under an operative agreement between
himself and Ross; this was run indefinitely--so long as there was
any of this land left to sell.The next thing was to raise twelve
thousand five hundred dollars for improvements, which he did, and then
to furnish some twenty-five hundred dollars more for taxes and
unconsidered expenses, items which had come up in carrying out the
improvement work which had been planned.It seemed that hard and soft
earth made a difference in grading costs, that trees would not always
flourish as expected, that certain members of the city water and gas
departments had to be "seen" and "fixed" before certain other
improvements could be effected.Ross attended to all this, but the
cost of the proceedings was something which had to be discussed, and
Lester heard it all.After the land was put in shape, about a year after the original
conversation, it was necessary to wait until spring for the proper
advertising and booming of the new section; and this advertising began
to call at once for the third payment.Lester disposed of an
additional fifteen thousand dollars worth of securities in order to
follow this venture to its logical and profitable conclusion.Up to this time he was rather pleased with his venture.Ross had
certainly been thorough and business-like in his handling of the
various details.It was given a
rather attractive title--"Inwood," although, as Lester noted,
there was precious little wood anywhere around there.But Ross assured
him that people looking for a suburban residence would be attracted by
the name; seeing the vigorous efforts in tree-planting that had been
made to provide for shade in the future, they would take the will for
the deed.The first chill wind that blew upon the infant project came in the
form of a rumor that the International Packing Company, one of the big
constituent members of the packing house combination at Halstead and
Thirty-ninth streets, had determined to desert the old group and lay
out a new packing area for itself.The papers explained that the
company intended to go farther south, probably below Fifty-fifth
Street and west of Ashland Avenue.This was the territory that was
located due west of Lester's property, and the mere suspicion that the
packing company might invade the territory was sufficient to blight
the prospects of any budding real estate deal.He decided, after quick
deliberation, that the best thing to do would be to boom the property
heavily, by means of newspaper advertising, and see if it could not be
disposed of before any additional damage was likely to be done to it.He laid the matter before Lester, who agreed that this would be
advisable.They had already expended six thousand dollars in
advertising, and now the additional sum of three thousand dollars was
spent in ten days, to make it appear that In wood was an ideal
residence section, equipped with every modern convenience for the
home-lover, and destined to be one of the most exclusive and beautiful
suburbs of the city.A few lots were sold, but the
rumor that the International Packing Company might come was persistent
and deadly; from any point of view, save that of a foreign population
neighborhood, the enterprise was a failure.To say that Lester was greatly disheartened by this blow is to put
it mildly.Practically fifty thousand dollars, two-thirds of all his
earthly possessions, outside of his stipulated annual income, was tied
up here; and there were taxes to pay, repairs to maintain, actual
depreciation in value to face.He suggested to Ross that the area
might be sold at its cost value, or a loan raised on it, and the whole
enterprise abandoned; but that experienced real estate dealer was not
so sanguine.He had had one or two failures of this kind before.He
was superstitious about anything which did not go smoothly from the
beginning.If it didn't go it was a hoodoo--a black
shadow--and he wanted no more to do with it.Other real estate
men, as he knew to his cost, were of the same opinion.Some three years later the property was sold under the sheriff's
hammer.Lester, having put in fifty thousand dollars all told,
recovered a trifle more than eighteen thousand; and some of his wise
friends assured him that he was lucky in getting off so easily.CHAPTER L


While the real estate deal was in progress Mrs.She had been staying in Cincinnati for a few months,
and had learned a great deal as to the real facts of Lester's
irregular mode of life.The question whether or not he was really
married to Jennie remained an open one.The garbled details of
Jennie's early years, the fact that a Chicago paper had written him up
as a young millionaire who was sacrificing his fortune for love of
her, the certainty that Robert had practically eliminated him from any
voice in the Kane Company, all came to her ears.She hated to think
that Lester was making such a sacrifice of himself.He had let nearly
a year slip by without doing anything.In two more years his chance
would be gone.He had said to her in London that he was without many
illusions.Did he really love her, or was he just
sorry for her?Letty wanted very much to find out for sure.Gerald leased in Chicago was a most imposing
one on Drexel Boulevard."I'm going to take a house in your town this
winter, and I hope to see a lot of you," she wrote to Lester."I'm
awfully bored with life here in Cincinnati.After Europe it's
so--well, you know.You ought to know that you have a loving friend in her.Her
daughter is going to marry Jimmy Severance in the spring."Lester thought of her coming with mingled feelings of pleasure and
uncertainty.Would she
foolishly begin by attempting to invite him and Jennie?That meant that Jennie would have to
be eliminated.He would have to make a clean breast of the whole
affair to Letty.Then she could do as she pleased about their future
intimacy.Seated in Letty's comfortable boudoir one afternoon, facing
a vision of loveliness in pale yellow, he decided that he might as
well have it out with her.Just at this time he
was beginning to doubt the outcome of the real estate deal, and
consequently he was feeling a little blue, and, as a concomitant, a
little confidential.He could not as yet talk to Jennie about his
troubles."You know, Lester," said Letty, by way of helping him to his
confession--the maid had brought tea for her and some brandy and
soda for him, and departed--"that I have been hearing a lot of
things about you since I've been back in this country.Aren't you
going to tell me all about yourself?You know I have your real
interests at heart.""What have you been hearing, Letty?""Oh, about your father's will for one thing, and the fact that
you're out of the company, and some gossip about Mrs.Kane which
doesn't interest me very much.Aren't you going
to straighten things out, so that you can have what rightfully belongs
to you?It seems to me such a great sacrifice, Lester, unless, of
course, you are very much in love.Lester paused and deliberated before replying."I really don't know
how to answer that last question, Letty," he said."Sometimes I think
that I love her; sometimes I wonder whether I do or not.I'm going to
be perfectly frank with you.I was never in such a curious position in
my life before.You like me so much, and I--well, I don't say
what I think of you," he smiled."But anyhow, I can talk to you
frankly."I thought as much," she said, as he paused."And I'm not married because I have never been able to make up my
mind just what to do about it.When I first met Jennie I thought her
the most entrancing girl I had ever laid eyes on.""That speaks volumes for my charms at that time," interrupted his
vis-a-vis."Don't interrupt me if you want to hear this," he smiled."Tell me one thing," she questioned, "and then I won't."There was something about her so--"

"Love at first sight," again interpolated Letty foolishly."Are you going to let me tell this?"I can't help a twinge or two.""Well, anyhow, I lost my head.I thought she was the most perfect
thing under the sun, even if she was a little out of my world.I thought that I could just take her, and
then--well, you know.I didn't
think that would prove as serious as it did.I never cared for any
other woman but you before and--I'll be frank--I didn't know
whether I wanted to marry you.I thought I didn't want to marry any
woman.I said to myself that I could just take Jennie, and then, after
a while, when things had quieted down some, we could separate."Yes, I understand," replied his confessor."Well, you see, Letty, it hasn't worked out that way.She's a woman
of a curious temperament.She possesses a world of feeling and
emotion.She's not educated in the sense in which we understand that
word, but she has natural refinement and tact.She's the most affectionate
creature under the sun.Her devotion to her mother and father was
beyond words.Her love for her--daughter she's hers, not
mine--is perfect.She hasn't any of the graces of the smart
society woman.She can't join in any
rapid-fire conversation.Some of
her big thoughts never come to the surface at all, but you can feel
that she is thinking and that she is feeling.""You pay her a lovely tribute, Lester," said Letty."She's a good woman, Letty; but, for all
that I have said, I sometimes think that it's only sympathy that's
holding me.""Don't be too sure," she said warningly."Yes, but I've gone through with a great deal.The thing for me to
have done was to have married her in the first place.There have been
so many entanglements since, so much rowing and discussion, that I've
rather lost my bearings.I
stand to lose eight hundred thousand if I marry her--really, a
great deal more, now that the company has been organized into a trust.If I don't marry her, I lose
everything outright in about two more years.Of course, I might
pretend that I have separated from her, but I don't care to lie.I
can't work it out that way without hurting her feelings, and she's
been the soul of devotion.Right down in my heart, at this minute, I
don't know whether I want to give her up.Honestly, I don't know what
the devil to do."Lester looked, lit a cigar in a far-off, speculative fashion, and
looked out of the window.questioned Letty, staring at the
floor.She rose, after a few moments of silence, and put her hands on
his round, solid head.Her yellow, silken house-gown, faintly scented,
touched his shoulders."You certainly have
tied yourself up in a knot.But it's a Gordian knot, my dear, and it
will have to be cut.Why don't you discuss this whole thing with her,
just as you have with me, and see how she feels about it?""It seems such an unkind thing to do," he replied."You must take some action, Lester dear," she insisted.Frankly, I
can't advise you to marry her; and I'm not speaking for myself in
that, though I'll take you gladly, even if you did forsake me in the
first place.I'll be perfectly honest--whether you ever come to
me or not--I love you, and always shall love you.""I know it," said Lester, getting up.He took her hands in his, and
studied her face curiously."But you're too big a man, Lester, to settle down on ten thousand a
year," she continued."You're too much of a social figure to drift.You ought to get back into the social and financial world where you
belong.All that's happened won't injure you, if you reclaim your
interest in the company.And if you
tell her the truth she won't object, I'm sure.If she cares for you,
as you think she does, she will be glad to make this sacrifice.You can provide for her handsomely, of course.""It isn't the money that Jennie wants," said Lester, gloomily."Well, even if it isn't, she can live without you and she can live
better for having an ample income.""She will never want if I can help it," he said solemnly."You must leave her," she urged, with a new touch of decisiveness.Why don't you make
up your mind to act at once--to-day, for that matter?To tell
you the truth, I hate to do it.I'm not one to run around and discuss my affairs with other people.I've refused to talk about this to any one heretofore--my father,
my mother, any one.But somehow you have always seemed closer to me
than any one else, and, since I met you this time, I have felt as
though I ought to explain--I have really wanted to.I don't know whether you understand how that can be under the
circumstances.You're nearer to me intellectually and
emotionally than I thought you were.You want the truth,
don't you?Now explain me to myself, if you
can.""I don't want to argue with you, Lester," she said softly, laying
her hand on his arm.I understand quite
well how it has all come about.I'm sorry--" she hesitated--"for Mrs.But she isn't the woman for
you, Lester; she really isn't.It seems so
unfair for us two to discuss her in this way, but really it isn't.We
all have to stand on our merits.And I'm satisfied, if the facts in
this case were put before her, as you have put them before me, she
would see just how it all is, and agree.Why, Lester, if I were in her position I would let you go.It would
hurt me, but I'd do it.It will hurt her, but she'll do it.Now, mark
you my words, she will.I think I understand her as well as you
do--better--for I am a woman.Oh," she said, pausing, "I
wish I were in a position to talk to her.Lester looked at Letty, wondering at her eagerness.She was
beautiful, magnetic, immensely worth while.She paused, a little crestfallen but determined."This is the time to act," she repeated, her whole soul in her
eyes.She wanted this man, and she was not ashamed to let him see that
she wanted him."Well, I'll think of it," he said uneasily, then, rather hastily,
he bade her good-by and went away.CHAPTER LI


Lester had thought of his predicament earnestly enough, and he
would have been satisfied to act soon if it had not been that one of
those disrupting influences which sometimes complicate our affairs
entered into his Hyde Park domicile.Gerhardt's health began rapidly
to fail.Little by little he had been obliged to give up his various duties
about the place; finally he was obliged to take to his bed.He lay in
his room, devotedly attended by Jennie and visited constantly by
Vesta, and occasionally by Lester.There was a window not far from his
bed, which commanded a charming view of the lawn and one of the
surrounding streets, and through this he would gaze by the hour,
wondering how the world was getting on without him.He suspected that
Woods, the coachman, was not looking after the horses and harnesses as
well as he should, that the newspaper carrier was getting negligent in
his delivery of the papers, that the furnace man was wasting coal, or
was not giving them enough heat.A score of little petty worries,
which were nevertheless real enough to him.He knew how a house should
be kept.He was always rigid in his performance of his self-appointed
duties, and he was so afraid that things would not go right.Jennie
made for him a most imposing and sumptuous dressing-gown of basted
wool, covered with dark-blue silk, and bought him a pair of soft,
thick, wool slippers to match, but he did not wear them often.He
preferred to lie in bed, read his Bible and the Lutheran papers, and
ask Jennie how things were getting along."I want you should go down in the basement and see what that feller
is doing.He's not giving us any heat," he would complain."I bet I
know what he does.He sits down there and reads, and then he forgets
what the fire is doing until it is almost out.The beer is right there
where he can take it.You don't know what kind
of a man he is.Jennie would protest that the house was fairly comfortable, that
the man was a nice, quiet, respectable-looking American--that if
he did drink a little beer it would not matter.Gerhardt would
immediately become incensed."That is always the way," he declared vigorously.You are always so ready to let things go if I am not
there.How do you know he is a nice man?If you don't watch
him he will be just like the others, no good.You should go around and
see how things are for yourself.""All right, papa," she would reply in a genial effort to soothe
him, "I will.Don't you
want a cup of coffee now and some toast?""No," Gerhardt would sigh immediately, "my stomach it don't do
right.I don't know how I am going to come out of this."Makin, the leading physician of the vicinity, and a man of
considerable experience and ability, called at Jennie's request and
suggested a few simple things--hot milk, a wine tonic, rest, but
he told Jennie that she must not expect too much."You know he is
quite well along in years now.If he were twenty
years younger we might do a great deal for him.As it is he is quite
well off where he is.He may get up and be
around again, and then he may not.I
have never any care as to what may happen to me.Jennie felt sorry to think that her father might die, but she was
pleased to think that if he must it was going to be under such
comfortable circumstances.It soon became evident that this was Gerhardt's last illness, and
Jennie thought it her duty to communicate with her brothers and
sisters.She wrote Bass that his father was not well, and had a letter
from him saying that he was very busy and couldn't come on unless the
danger was an immediate one.He went on to say that George was in
Rochester, working for a wholesale wall-paper house--the
Sheff-Jefferson Company, he thought.Martha and her husband had gone
to Boston.Her address was a little suburb named Belmont, just outside
the city.William was in Omaha, working for a local electric company.Veronica was married to a man named Albert Sheridan, who was connected
with a wholesale drug company in Cleveland."She never comes to see
me," complained Bass, "but I'll let her know."They
were very sorry, and would she let them know if anything happened.George wrote that he could not think of coming to Chicago unless his
father was very ill indeed, but that he would like to be informed from
time to time how he was getting along.William, as he told Jennie some
time afterward, did not get her letter.The progress of the old German's malady toward final dissolution
preyed greatly on Jennie's mind; for, in spite of the fact that they
had been so far apart in times past, they had now grown very close
together.Gerhardt had come to realize clearly that his outcast
daughter was goodness itself--at least, so far as he was
concerned.She never quarreled with him, never crossed him in any way.Now that he was sick, she was in and out of his room a dozen times in
an evening or an afternoon, seeing whether he was "all right," asking
how he liked his breakfast, or his lunch, or his dinner.As he grew
weaker she would sit by him and read, or do her sewing in his room.One day when she was straightening his pillow he took her hand and
kissed it.He was feeling very weak--and despondent.She looked
up in astonishment, a lump in her throat."You're a good girl, Jennie," he said brokenly.I've been hard and cross, but I'm an old man."Oh, papa, please don't," she pleaded, tears welling from her eyes.I'm the one who has been all
wrong.""No, no," he said; and she sank down on her knees beside him and
cried.He put his thin, yellow hand on her hair."There, there," he
said brokenly, "I understand a lot of things I didn't.She left the room, ostensibly to wash her face and hands, and cried
her eyes out.She tried to be more attentive, but that was impossible.But
after this reconciliation he seemed happier and more contented, and
they spent a number of happy hours together, just talking.Once he
said to her, "You know I feel just like I did when I was a boy.If it
wasn't for my bones I could get up and dance on the grass."Jennie fairly smiled and sobbed in one breath."You'll get
stronger, papa," she said.She was so glad she had been able to make him
comfortable these last few years.As for Lester, he was affectionate and considerate."Well, how is it to-night?"he would ask the moment he entered the
house, and he would always drop in for a few minutes before dinner to
see how the old man was getting along."He looks pretty well," he
would tell Jennie."He's apt to live some time yet.Vesta also spent much time with her grandfather, for she had come
to love him dearly.She would bring her books, if it didn't disturb
him too much, and recite some of her lessons, or she would leave his
door open, and play for him on the piano.Lester had bought her a
handsome music-box also, which she would sometimes carry to his room
and play for him.At times he wearied of everything and everybody save
Jennie; he wanted to be alone with her.She would sit beside him quite
still and sew.She could see plainly that the end was only a little
way off.Gerhardt, true to his nature, took into consideration all the
various arrangements contingent upon his death.He wished to be buried
in the little Lutheran cemetery, which was several miles farther out
on the South Side, and he wanted the beloved minister of his church to
officiate."Just my black suit and those
Sunday shoes of mine, and that black string tie.Jennie begged him not to talk of it, but he would.One day at four
o'clock he had a sudden sinking spell, and at five he was dead.Jennie
held his hands, watching his labored breathing; once or twice he
opened his eyes to smile at her."I don't mind going," he said, in
this final hour."Don't talk of dying, papa," she pleaded.The finish which time thus put to this troubled life affected
Jennie deeply.Strong in her kindly, emotional relationships, Gerhardt
had appealed to her not only as her father, but as a friend and
counselor.She saw him now in his true perspective, a hard-working,
honest, sincere old German, who had done his best to raise a
troublesome family and lead an honest life.Truly she had been his one
great burden, and she had never really dealt truthfully with him to
the end.She wondered now if where he was he could see that she had
lied.Telegrams were sent to all the children.Bass wired that he was
coming, and arrived the next day.The others wired that they could not
come, but asked for details, which Jennie wrote.The Lutheran minister
was called in to say prayers and fix the time of the burial service.A
fat, smug undertaker was commissioned to arrange all the details.Some
few neighborhood friends called--those who had remained most
faithful--and on the second morning following his death the
services were held.Lester accompanied Jennie and Vesta and Bass to
the little red brick Lutheran church, and sat stolidly through the
rather dry services.He listened wearily to the long discourse on the
beauties and rewards of a future life and stirred irritably when
reference was made to a hell.Bass was rather bored, but considerate.He looked upon his father now much as he would on any other man.Only
Jennie wept sympathetically.She saw her father in perspective, the
long years of trouble he had had, the days in which he had had to saw
wood for a living, the days in which he had lived in a factory loft,
the little shabby house they had been compelled to live in in
Thirteenth Street, the terrible days of suffering they had spent in
Lorrie Street, in Cleveland, his grief over her, his grief over Mrs.Gerhardt, his love and care of Vesta, and finally these last days."Oh, he was a good man," she thought.They sang
a hymn, "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God," and then she sobbed.He was moved to the danger-line himself
by her grief."You'll have to do better than this," he whispered."My
God, I can't stand it.I'll have to get up and get out."Jennie
quieted a little, but the fact that the last visible ties were being
broken between her and her father was almost too much.At the grave in the Cemetery of the Redeemer, where Lester had
immediately arranged to purchase a lot, they saw the plain coffin
lowered and the earth shoveled in.Lester looked curiously at the bare
trees, the brown dead grass, and the brown soil of the prairie turned
up at this simple graveside.There was no distinction to this burial
plot.It was commonplace and shabby, a working-man's resting-place,
but so long as he wanted it, it was all right.He studied Bass's keen,
lean face, wondering what sort of a career he was cutting out for
himself.Bass looked to him like some one who would run a cigar store
successfully.He watched Jennie wiping her red eyes, and then he said
to himself again, "Well, there is something to her."The woman's
emotion was so deep, so real."There's no explaining a good woman," he
said to himself.On the way home, through the wind-swept, dusty streets, he talked
of life in general, Bass and Vesta being present."Jennie takes things
too seriously," he said.Life isn't as
bad as she makes out with her sensitive feelings.We all have our
troubles, and we all have to stand them, some more, some less.We
can't assume that any one is so much better or worse off than any one
else."I can't help it," said Jennie."I feel so sorry for some
people.""Jennie always was a little gloomy," put in Bass.He was thinking what a fine figure of a man Lester was, how
beautifully they lived, how Jennie had come up in the world.He was
thinking that there must be a lot more to her than he had originally
thought.At one time he thought Jennie
was a hopeless failure and no good."You ought to try to steel yourself to take things as they come
without going to pieces this way," said Lester finally.Jennie stared thoughtfully out of the carriage window.There was
the old house now, large and silent without Gerhardt.Just think, she
would never see him any more.They finally turned into the drive and
entered the library.Jeannette, nervous and sympathetic, served tea.She wondered curiously
where she would be when she died.CHAPTER LII


The fact that Gerhardt was dead made no particular difference to
Lester, except as it affected Jennie.He had liked the old German for
his many sterling qualities, but beyond that he thought nothing of him
one way or the other.He took Jennie to a watering-place for ten days
to help her recover her spirits, and it was soon after this that he
decided to tell her just how things stood with him; he would put the
problem plainly before her.It would be easier now, for Jennie had
been informed of the disastrous prospects of the real-estate deal.She
was also aware of his continued interest in Mrs.Lester did
not hesitate to let Jennie know that he was on very friendly terms
with her.Gerald had, at first, formally requested him to bring
Jennie to see her, but she never had called herself, and Jennie
understood quite clearly that it was not to be.Now that her father
was dead, she was beginning to wonder what was going to become of her;
she was afraid that Lester might not marry her.Certainly he showed no
signs of intending to do so.By one of those curious coincidences of thought, Robert also had
reached the conclusion that something should be done.He did not, for
one moment, imagine that he could directly work upon Lester--he
did not care to try--but he did think that some influence might
be brought to bear on Jennie.If
Lester had not married her already, she must realize full well that he
did not intend to do so.Suppose that some responsible third person
were to approach her, and explain how things were, including, of
course, the offer of an independent income?Might she not be willing
to leave Lester, and end all this trouble?After all, Lester was his
brother, and he ought not to lose his fortune.Robert had things very
much in his own hands now, and could afford to be generous.O'Brien, of Knight, Keatley & O'Brien, would be
the proper intermediary, for O'Brien was suave, good-natured, and
well-meaning, even if he was a lawyer.He might explain to Jennie very
delicately just how the family felt, and how much Lester stood to lose
if he continued to maintain his connection with her.If Lester had
married Jennie, O'Brien would find it out.A liberal provision would
be made for her--say fifty or one hundred thousand, or even one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars.O'Brien and gave
him his instructions.As one of the executors of Archibald Kane's
estate, it was really the lawyer's duty to look into the matter of
Lester's ultimate decision.On reaching the city, he called
up Lester, and found out to his satisfaction that he was out of town
for the day.He went out to the house in Hyde Park, and sent in his
card to Jennie.She came down-stairs in a few minutes quite
unconscious of the import of his message; he greeted her most
blandly.he asked, with an interlocutory jerk of his
head."I am, as you see by my card, Mr.O'Brien, of Knight, Keatley &
O'Brien," he began."We are the attorneys and executors of the late
Mr.You'll think it's
rather curious, my coming to you, but under your husband's father's
will there were certain conditions stipulated which affect you and Mr.These provisions are so important that I think
you ought to know about them--that is if Mr.I--pardon me--but the peculiar nature of them
makes me conclude that--possibly--he hasn't."He paused, a
very question-mark of a man--every feature of his face an
interrogation."I don't quite understand," said Jennie."I don't know anything
about the will.If there's anything that I ought to know, I suppose
Mr.Now, if you will allow me I'll go into the matter briefly.Then you
can judge for yourself whether you wish to hear the full particulars.Jennie seated
herself, and Mr.O'Brien pulled up a chair near to hers."I need not say to you, of course, that
there was considerable opposition on the part of Mr.Kane's father, to
this--ah--union between yourself and his son.""I know--" Jennie started to say, but checked herself.She was
puzzled, disturbed, and a little apprehensive.Kane senior died," he went on, "he indicated to
your--ah--to Mr.Lester Kane, that he felt this way.In his
will he made certain conditions governing the distribution of his
property which made it rather hard for his son,
your--ah--husband, to come into his rightful share.Ordinarily, he would have inherited one-fourth of the Kane
Manufacturing Company, worth to-day in the neighborhood of a million
dollars, perhaps more; also one-fourth of the other properties, which
now aggregate something like five hundred thousand dollars.Kane senior was really very anxious that his son should inherit
this property.But owing to the conditions which
your--ah--which Mr.Lester Kane
cannot possibly obtain his share, except by complying with
a--with a--certain wish which his father had expressed."O'Brien paused, his eyes moving back and forth side wise in
their sockets.In spite of the natural prejudice of the situation, he
was considerably impressed with Jennie's pleasing appearance.He could
see quite plainly why Lester might cling to her in the face of all
opposition.He continued to study her furtively as he sat there
waiting for her to speak.she finally asked, her nerves becoming
just a little tense under the strain of the silence."I am glad you were kind enough to ask me that," he went on."The
subject is a very difficult one for me to introduce--very
difficult.I come as an emissary of the estate, I might say as one of
the executors under the will of Mr.I know how keenly
your--ah--how keenly Mr.I know how
keenly you will probably feel about it.But it is one of those very
difficult things which cannot be helped--which must be got over
somehow.And while I hesitate very much to say so, I must tell you
that Mr.Kane senior stipulated in his will that unless,
unless"--again his eyes were moving sidewise to and fro--"he
saw fit to separate from--ah--you" he paused to get
breath--"he could not inherit this or any other sum or, at least,
only a very minor income of ten thousand a year; and that only on
condition that he should marry you.""I should add,"
he went on, "that under the will he was given three years in which to
indicate his intentions.He paused, half expecting some outburst of feeling from Jennie, but
she only looked at him fixedly, her eyes clouded with surprise,
distress, unhappiness.Lester was sacrificing his
fortune for her.His recent commercial venture was an effort to
rehabilitate himself, to put himself in an independent position.The
recent periods of preoccupation, of subtle unrest, and of
dissatisfaction over which she had grieved were now explained.He was
unhappy, he was brooding over this prospective loss, and he had never
told her.So his father had really disinherited him!O'Brien sat before her, troubled himself.He was very sorry for
her, now that he saw the expression of her face."I'm sorry," he said, when he saw that she was not going to make
any immediate reply, "that I have been the bearer of such unfortunate
news.It is a very painful situation that I find myself in at this
moment, I assure you.I bear you no ill will personally--of
course you understand that.The family really bears you no ill will
now--I hope you believe that.As I told your--ah--as I
told Mr.Kane, at the time the will was read, I considered it most
unfair, but, of course, as a mere executive under it and counsel for
his father, I could do nothing.I really think it best that you should
know how things stand, in order that you may help your--your
husband"--he paused, significantly--"if possible, to some
solution.It seems a pity to me, as it does to the various other
members of his family, that he should lose all this money."Jennie had turned her head away and was staring at the floor."He mustn't lose it," she said; "it isn't fair
that he should.""I am most delighted to hear you say that, Mrs.--Mrs.Kane,"
he went on, using for the first time her improbable title as Lester's
wife, without hesitation."I may as well be very frank with you, and
say that I feared you might take this information in quite another
spirit.Of course you know to begin with that the Kane family is very
clannish.Kane, your--ah--your husband's mother, was a
very proud and rather distant woman, and his sisters and brothers are
rather set in their notions as to what constitute proper family
connections.They look upon his relationship to you as irregular,
and--pardon me if I appear to be a little cruel--as not
generally satisfactory.As you know, there had been so much talk in
the last few years that Mr.Kane senior did not believe that the
situation could ever be nicely adjusted, so far as the family was
concerned.He felt that his son had not gone about it right in the
first place.One of the conditions of his will was that if your
husband--pardon me--if his son did not accept the
proposition in regard to separating from you and taking up his
rightful share of the estate, then to inherit anything at
all--the mere ten thousand a year I mentioned before--he
must--ah--he must pardon me, I seem a little brutal, but not
intentionally so--marry you."It was such a cruel thing to say this to her face.This whole attempt to live together illegally had proved disastrous at
every step.There was only one solution to the unfortunate
business--she could see that plainly.She must leave him, or he
must leave her.Lester living on ten
thousand dollars a year!He was thinking that Lester
both had and had not made a mistake.Why had he not married her in the
first place?"There is just one other point which I wish to make in this
connection, Mrs.Kane," he went on softly and easily."I see now that
it will not make any difference to you, but I am commissioned and in a
way constrained to make it.I hope you will take it in the manner in
which it is given.I don't know whether you are familiar with your
husband's commercial interests or not?""Well, in order to simplify matters, and to make it easier for you,
should you decide to assist your husband to a solution of this very
difficult situation--frankly, in case you might possibly decide
to leave on your own account, and maintain a separate establishment of
your own I am delighted to say that--ah--any sum,
say--ah--"

Jennie rose and walked dazedly to one of the windows, clasping her
hands as she went.In the event of your deciding to end the
connection it has been suggested that any reasonable sum you might
name, fifty, seventy-five, a hundred thousand dollars"--Mr.O'Brien was feeling very generous toward her--"would be gladly
set aside for your benefit--put in trust, as it were, so that you
would have it whenever you needed it."Please don't," said Jennie, hurt beyond the power to express
herself, unable mentally and physically to listen to another word.But please don't talk to
me any more, will you?"O'Brien, coming
to a keen realization of her sufferings.It has been very hard for me to do
this--very hard.I will come any time you suggest, or you can write me.I hope you will see fit
to say nothing to your husband of my visit--it will be advisable
that you should keep your own counsel in the matter.I value his
friendship very highly, and I am sincerely sorry."O'Brien went out into the hall to get his coat.Jennie touched
the electric button to summon the maid, and Jeannette came.Jennie
went back into the library, and Mr.O'Brien paced briskly down the
front walk.When she was really alone she put her doubled hands to her
chin, and stared at the floor, the queer design of the silken Turkish
rug resolving itself into some curious picture.She saw herself in a
small cottage somewhere, alone with Vesta; she saw Lester living in
another world, and beside him Mrs.She saw this house vacant,
and then a long stretch of time, and then--

"Oh," she sighed, choking back a desire to cry.With her hands she
brushed away a hot tear from each eye."It must be," she said to herself in thought.And then--"Oh, thank God that papa
is dead Anyhow, he did not live to see this."CHAPTER LIII


The explanation which Lester had concluded to be inevitable,
whether it led to separation or legalization of their hitherto banal
condition, followed quickly upon the appearance of Mr.O'Brien called he had gone on a journey to Hegewisch, a small
manufacturing town in Wisconsin, where he had been invited to witness
the trial of a new motor intended to operate elevators--with a
view to possible investment.When he came out to the house, interested
to tell Jennie something about it even in spite of the fact that he
was thinking of leaving her, he felt a sense of depression everywhere,
for Jennie, in spite of the serious and sensible conclusion she had
reached, was not one who could conceal her feelings easily.She was
brooding sadly over her proposed action, realizing that it was best to
leave but finding it hard to summon the courage which would let her
talk to him about it.She could not go without telling him what she
thought.She was absolutely convinced
that this one course of action--separation--was necessary
and advisable.She could not think of him as daring to make a
sacrifice of such proportions for her sake even if he wanted to.It was astonishing to her that he had let things go
along as dangerously and silently as he had.When he came in Jennie did her best to greet him with her
accustomed smile, but it was a pretty poor imitation.she asked, using her customary phrase of
inquiry.She walked with him to the library, and he
poked at the open fire with a long-handled poker before turning around
to survey the room generally.It was five o'clock of a January
afternoon.Jennie had gone to one of the windows to lower the shade.As she came back he looked at her critically."You're not quite your
usual self, are you?"he asked, sensing something out of the common in
her attitude."Why, yes, I feel all right," she replied, but there was a peculiar
uneven motion to the movement of her lips--a rippling tremor
which was unmistakable to him."I think I know better than that," he said, still gazing at her
steadily.She turned away from him a moment to get her breath and collect her
senses."There is something," she managed to
say."I know you have," he agreed, half smiling, but with a feeling that
there was much of grave import back of this.She was silent for a moment, biting her lips.She did not quite
know how to begin.Finally she broke the spell with: "There was a man
here yesterday--a Mr."He came to talk to me about you and your father's will."She paused, for his face clouded immediately."Why the devil should
he be talking to you about my father's will!""Please don't get angry, Lester," said Jennie calmly, for she
realized that she must remain absolute mistress of herself if anything
were to be accomplished toward the resolution of her problem."He
wanted to tell me what a sacrifice you are making," she went on."He
wished to show me that there was only a little time left before you
would lose your inheritance."What the devil does he mean by
putting his nose in my private affairs?"This is some
of Robert's work.Why should Knight, Keatley & O'Brien be meddling
in my affairs?This whole business is getting to be a nuisance!"He
was in a boiling rage in a moment, as was shown by his darkening skin
and sulphurous eyes.He came to himself sufficiently after a time to add:

"Well."He said that if you married me you would only get ten thousand a
year.That if you didn't and still lived with me you would get nothing
at all.If you would leave me, or I would leave you, you would get all
of a million and a half.Don't you think you had better leave me
now?"She had not intended to propound this leading question so quickly,
but it came out as a natural climax to the situation.She realized
instantly that if he were really in love with her he would answer with
an emphatic "no."If he didn't care, he would hesitate, he would
delay, he would seek to put off the evil day of reckoning."I don't see that," he retorted irritably."I don't see that
there's any need for either interference or hasty action.What I
object to is their coming here and mixing in my private affairs."Jennie was cut to the quick by his indifference, his wrath instead
of affection.To her the main point at issue was her leaving him or
his leaving her.To him this recent interference was obviously the
chief matter for discussion and consideration.The meddling of others
before he was ready to act was the terrible thing.She had hoped, in
spite of what she had seen, that possibly, because of the long time
they had lived together and the things which (in a way) they had
endured together, he might have come to care for her deeply--that
she had stirred some emotion in him which would never brook real
separation, though some seeming separation might be necessary.He had
not married her, of course, but then there had been so many things
against them.Now, in this final hour, anyhow, he might have shown
that he cared deeply, even if he had deemed it necessary to let her
go.She felt for the time being as if, for all that she had lived with
him so long, she did not understand him, and yet, in spite of this
feeling, she knew also that she did.He could
not care for any one enthusiastically and demonstratively.He could
care enough to seize her and take her to himself as he had, but he
could not care enough to keep her if something more important
appeared.She was in a quandary, hurt,
bleeding, but for once in her life, determined.Whether he wanted to
or not, she must not let him make this sacrifice.She must leave
him--if he would not leave her.It was not important enough that
she should stay."Don't you think you had better act soon?"she continued, hoping
that some word of feeling would come from him."There is only a little
time left, isn't there?"Jennie nervously pushed a book to and fro on the table, her fear
that she would not be able to keep up appearances troubling her
greatly.It was hard for her to know what to do or say.Lester was so
terrible when he became angry.Still it ought not to be so hard for
him to go, now that he had Mrs.Gerald, if he only wished to do
so--and he ought to.His fortune was so much more important to
him than anything she could be."Don't worry about that," he replied stubbornly, his wrath at his
brother, and his family, and O'Brien still holding him.I don't know what I want to do yet.I like the effrontery of
these people!But I won't talk any more about it; isn't dinner nearly
ready?"He was so injured in his pride that he scarcely took the
trouble to be civil.He was forgetting all about her and what she was
feeling.He hated his brother Robert for this affront.He would have
enjoyed wringing the necks of Messrs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien,
singly and collectively.The question could not be dropped for good and all, and it came up
again at dinner, after Jennie had done her best to collect her
thoughts and quiet her nerves.They could not talk very freely because
of Vesta and Jeannette, but she managed to get in a word or two."I could take a little cottage somewhere," she suggested softly,
hoping to find him in a modified mood.I would not know what to do with a big house like this alone.""I wish you wouldn't discuss this business any longer, Jennie," he
persisted.I don't know that I'm going to do
anything of the sort.I don't know what I'm going to do."He was so
sour and obstinate, because of O'Brien, that she finally gave it up.Vesta was astonished to see her stepfather, usually so courteous, in
so grim a mood.Jennie felt a curious sense that she might hold him if she would,
for he was doubting; but she knew also that she should not wish.It was not fair to herself, or kind, or
decent."Oh yes, Lester, you must," she pleaded, at a later time."I won't
talk about it any more, but you must.I won't let you do anything
else."There were hours when it came up afterward--every day, in
fact--in their boudoir, in the library, in the dining-room, at
breakfast, but not always in words.She was sure that he should be made to
act.Since he was showing more kindly consideration for her, she was
all the more certain that he should act soon.Just how to go about it
she did not know, but she looked at him longingly, trying to help him
make up his mind.She would be happy, she assured herself--she
would be happy thinking that he was happy once she was away from him.He was a good man, most delightful in everything, perhaps, save his
gift of love.He really did not love her--could not perhaps,
after all that had happened, even though she loved him most earnestly.But his family had been most brutal in their opposition, and this had
affected his attitude.She could see
now how his big, strong brain might be working in a circle.He was too
decent to be absolutely brutal about this thing and leave her, too
really considerate to look sharply after his own interests as he
should, or hers--but he ought to."You must decide, Lester," she kept saying to him, from time to
time.Maybe, when this thing is all over you might want to come back
to me."I'm not ready to come to a decision," was his invariable reply."I
don't know that I want to leave you.This money is important, of
course, but money isn't everything.I can live on ten thousand a year
if necessary."Oh, but you're so much more placed in the world now, Lester," she
argued.Look how much it costs to run this house
alone.And a million and a half of dollars--why, I wouldn't let
you think of losing that."Where would you think of going if it came to that?"Do you remember that little town of
Sandwood, this side of Kenosha?I have often thought it would be a
pleasant place to live.""I don't like to think of this," he said finally in an outburst of
frankness.The conditions have all been against
this union of ours.I suppose I should have married you in the first
place.Jennie choked in her throat, but said nothing."Anyhow, this won't be the last of it, if I can help it," he
concluded.He was thinking that the storm might blow over; once he had
the money, and then--but he hated compromises and
subterfuges.It came by degrees to be understood that, toward the end of
February, she should look around at Sandwood and see what she could
find.She was to have ample means, he told her, everything that she
wanted.After a time he might come out and visit her occasionally.And
he was determined in his heart that he would make some people pay for
the trouble they had caused him.O'Brien
shortly and talk things over.He wanted for his personal satisfaction
to tell him what he thought of him.At the same time, in the background of his mind, moved the shadowy
figure of Mrs.Gerald--charming, sophisticated, well placed in
every sense of the word.He did not want to give her the broad reality
of full thought, but she was always there."Perhaps I'd better," he half concluded.When February came he was
ready to act.CHAPTER LIV


The little town of Sandwood, "this side of Kenosha," as Jennie had
expressed it, was only a short distance from Chicago, an hour and
fifteen minutes by the local train.It had a population of some three
hundred families, dwelling in small cottages, which were scattered
over a pleasant area of lake-shore property.The houses were not worth more than from three to five
thousand dollars each, but, in most cases, they were harmoniously
constructed, and the surrounding trees, green for the entire year,
gave them a pleasing summery appearance.Jennie, at the time they had
passed by there--it was an outing taken behind a pair of fast
horses--had admired the look of a little white church steeple,
set down among green trees, and the gentle rocking of the boats upon
the summer water."I should like to live in a place like this some time," she had
said to Lester, and he had made the comment that it was a little too
peaceful for him."I can imagine getting to the place where I might
like this, but not now.It came to her when
she thought that the world was trying.If she had to be alone ever and
could afford it she would like to live in a place like Sandwood.There
she would have a little garden, some chickens, perhaps, a tall pole
with a pretty bird-house on it, and flowers and trees and green grass
everywhere about.If she could have a little cottage in a place like
this which commanded a view of the lake she could sit of a summer
evening and sew.Vesta could play about or come home from school.She
might have a few friends, or not any.She was beginning to think that
she could do very well living alone if it were not for Vesta's social
needs.Books were pleasant things--she was finding that
out--books like Irving's Sketch Book, Lamb's Elia,
and Hawthorne's Twice Told Tales.Vesta was coming to be quite
a musician in her way, having a keen sense of the delicate and refined
in musical composition.She had a natural sense of harmony and a love
for those songs and instrumental compositions which reflect
sentimental and passionate moods; and she could sing and play quite
well.Her voice was, of course, quite untrained--she was only
fourteen--but it was pleasant to listen to.She was beginning to
show the combined traits of her mother and father--Jennie's
gentle, speculative turn of mind, combined with Brander's vivacity of
spirit and innate executive capacity.She could talk to her mother in
a sensible way about things, nature, books, dress, love, and from her
developing tendencies Jennie caught keen glimpses of the new worlds
which Vesta was to explore.The nature of modern school life, its
consideration of various divisions of knowledge, music, science, all
came to Jennie watching her daughter take up new themes.Vesta was
evidently going to be a woman of considerable ability--not
irritably aggressive, but self-constructive.She would be able to take
care of herself.All this pleased Jennie and gave her great hopes for
Vesta's future.The cottage which was finally secured at Sandwood was only a story
and a half in height, but it was raised upon red brick piers between
which were set green lattices and about which ran a veranda.The house
was long and narrow, its full length--some five rooms in a
row--facing the lake.There was a dining-room with windows
opening even with the floor, a large library with built-in shelves for
books, and a parlor whose three large windows afforded air and
sunshine at all times.The plot of ground in which this cottage stood was one hundred feet
square and ornamented with a few trees.The former owner had laid out
flower-beds, and arranged green hardwood tubs for the reception of
various hardy plants and vines.The house was painted white, with
green shutters and green shingles.It had been Lester's idea, since this thing must be, that Jennie
might keep the house in Hyde Park just as it was, but she did not want
to do that.At first, she did not think she would take
anything much with her, but she finally saw that it was advisable to
do as Lester suggested--to fit out the new place with a selection
of silverware, hangings, and furniture from the Hyde Park house."You have no idea what you will or may want," he said.A lease of the cottage was taken for two years, together with an
option for an additional five years, including the privilege of
purchase.So long as he was letting her go, Lester wanted to be
generous.He could not think of her as wanting for anything, and he
did not propose that she should.His one troublesome thought was, what
explanation was to be made to Vesta.He liked her very much and wanted
her "life kept free of complications."Why not send her off to a boarding-school until spring?"he
suggested once; but owing to the lateness of the season this was
abandoned as inadvisable.Later they agreed that business affairs made
it necessary for him to travel and for Jennie to move.Later Vesta
could be told that Jennie had left him for any reason she chose to
give.It was a trying situation, all the more bitter to Jennie because
she realized that in spite of the wisdom of it indifference to her was
involved.He really did not care enough, as much as he
cared.The relationship of man and woman which we study so passionately in
the hope of finding heaven knows what key to the mystery of existence
holds no more difficult or trying situation than this of mutual
compatibility broken or disrupted by untoward conditions which in
themselves have so little to do with the real force and beauty of the
relationship itself.These days of final dissolution in which this
household, so charmingly arranged, the scene of so many pleasant
activities, was literally going to pieces was a period of great trial
to both Jennie and Lester.On her part it was one of intense
suffering, for she was of that stable nature that rejoices to fix
itself in a serviceable and harmonious relationship, and then stay so.For her life was made up of those mystic chords of sympathy and memory
which bind up the transient elements of nature into a harmonious and
enduring scene.One of those chords--this home was her home,
united and made beautiful by her affection and consideration for each
person and every object.Now the time had come when it must cease.If she had ever had anything before in her life which had been like
this it might have been easier to part with it now, though, as she had
proved, Jennie's affections were not based in any way upon material
considerations.Her love of life and of personality were free from the
taint of selfishness.She went about among these various rooms
selecting this rug, that set of furniture, this and that ornament,
wishing all the time with all her heart and soul that it need not be.Just to think, in a little while Lester would not come any more of an
evening!She would not need to get up first of a morning and see that
coffee was made for her lord, that the table in the dining-room looked
just so.It had been a habit of hers to arrange a bouquet for the
table out of the richest blooming flowers of the conservatory, and she
had always felt in doing it that it was particularly for him.Now it
would not be necessary any more--not for him.When one is
accustomed to wait for the sound of a certain carriage-wheel of an
evening grating upon your carriage drive, when one is used to listen
at eleven, twelve, and one, waking naturally and joyfully to the echo
of a certain step on the stair, the separation, the ending of these
things, is keen with pain.These were the thoughts that were running
through Jennie's brain hour after hour and day after day.Lester on his part was suffering in another fashion.His was not
the sorrow of lacerated affection, of discarded and despised love, but
of that painful sense of unfairness which comes to one who knows that
he is making a sacrifice of the virtues--kindness, loyalty,
affection--to policy.Policy was dictating a very splendid course
of action from one point of view.Free of Jennie, providing for her
admirably, he was free to go his way, taking to himself the mass of
affairs which come naturally with great wealth.He could not help
thinking of the thousand and one little things which Jennie had been
accustomed to do for him, the hundred and one comfortable and pleasant
and delightful things she meant to him.The virtues which she
possessed were quite dear to his mind.He had gone over them time and
again.Now he was compelled to go over them finally, to see that she
was suffering without making a sign.Her manner and attitude toward
him in these last days were quite the same as they had always
been--no more, no less.She was not indulging in private
hysterics, as another woman might have done; she was not pretending a
fortitude in suffering she did not feel, showing him one face while
wishing him to see another behind it.She was calm, gentle,
considerate--thoughtful of him--where he would go and what
he would do, without irritating him by her inquiries.He was struck
quite favorably by her ability to take a large situation largely, and
he admired her.There was something to this woman, let the world think
what it might.It was a shame that her life was passed under such a
troubled star.The sound of its
voice was in his ears.It had on occasion shown him its bared teeth.The last hour came, when having made excuses to this and that
neighbor, when having spread the information that they were going
abroad, when Lester had engaged rooms at the Auditorium, and the mass
of furniture which could not be used had gone to storage, that it was
necessary to say farewell to this Hyde Park domicile.Jennie had
visited Sandwood in company with Lester several times.He had
carefully examined the character of the place.He was satisfied that
it was nice but lonely.Spring was at hand, the flowers would be
something.She was going to keep a gardener and man of all work."Very well," he said, "only I want you to be comfortable."In the mean time Lester had been arranging his personal affairs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien through his own
attorney, Mr.Watson, that he would expect them to deliver his share
of his father's securities on a given date.He had made up his mind
that as long as he was compelled by circumstances to do this thing he
would do a number of other things equally ruthless.He would sit as a director in the United Carriage
Company--with his share of the stock it would be impossible to
keep him out.Gerald's money he would become a
controlling factor in the United Traction of Cincinnati, in which his
brother was heavily interested, and in the Western Steel Works, of
which his brother was now the leading adviser.What a different figure
he would be now from that which he had been during the past few
years!Jennie was depressed to the point of despair.When she first came here
and neighbors had begun to drop in she had imagined herself on the
threshold of a great career, that some day, possibly, Lester would
marry her.Now, blow after blow had been delivered, and the home and
dream were a ruin.Jeannette, Harry Ward, and Mrs.Frissell had been discharged, the furniture for a good part was in
storage, and for her, practically, Lester was no more.She realized
clearly that he would not come back.If he could do this thing now,
even considerately, he could do much more when he was free and away
later.Immersed in his great affairs, he would forget, of course.Had not everything--everything
illustrated that to her?Love was not enough in this world--that
was so plain.One needed education, wealth, training, the ability to
fight and scheme, She did not want to do that.The day came when the house was finally closed and the old life was
at an end.Lester traveled with Jennie to Sandwood.He spent some
little while in the house trying to get her used to the idea of
change--it was not so bad.He intimated that he would come again
soon, but he went away, and all his words were as nothing against the
fact of the actual and spiritual separation.When Jennie saw him going
down the brick walk that afternoon, his solid, conservative figure
clad in a new tweed suit, his overcoat on his arm, self-reliance and
prosperity written all over him, she thought that she would die.She
had kissed Lester good-by and had wished him joy, prosperity, peace;
then she made an excuse to go to her bedroom.Vesta came after a time,
to seek her, but now her eyes were quite dry; everything had subsided
to a dull ache.The new life was actually begun for her--a life
without Lester, without Gerhardt, without any one save Vesta.she thought, as she went
into the kitchen, for she had determined to do at least some of her
own work.If it
were not for Vesta she would have sought some regular outside
employment.Anything to keep from brooding, for in that direction lay
madness.CHAPTER LV


The social and business worlds of Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland,
and other cities saw, during the year or two which followed the
breaking of his relationship with Jennie, a curious rejuvenation in
the social and business spirit of Lester Kane.He had become rather
distant and indifferent to certain personages and affairs while he was
living with her, but now he suddenly appeared again, armed with
authority from a number of sources, looking into this and that matter
with the air of one who has the privilege of power, and showing
himself to be quite a personage from the point of view of finance and
commerce.It must be admitted that he was in
some respects a mentally altered Lester.Up to the time he had met
Jennie he was full of the assurance of the man who has never known
defeat.To have been reared in luxury as he had been, to have seen
only the pleasant side of society, which is so persistent and so
deluding where money is concerned, to have been in the run of big
affairs not because one has created them, but because one is a part of
them and because they are one's birthright, like the air one breathes,
could not help but create one of those illusions of solidarity which
is apt to befog the clearest brain.It is so hard for us to know what
we have not seen.It is so difficult for us to feel what we have not
experienced.Like this world of ours, which seems so solid and
persistent solely because we have no knowledge of the power which
creates it, Lester's world seemed solid and persistent and real enough
to him.It was only when the storms set in and the winds of adversity
blew and he found himself facing the armed forces of convention that
he realized he might be mistaken as to the value of his personality,
that his private desires and opinions were as nothing in the face of a
public conviction; that he was wrong.The race spirit, or social
avatar, the "Zeitgeist" as the Germans term it, manifested itself as
something having a system in charge, and the organization of society
began to show itself to him as something based on possibly a
spiritual, or, at least, superhuman counterpart.He could not fly in
the face of it.The
people of his time believed that some particular form of social
arrangement was necessary, and unless he complied with that he could,
as he saw, readily become a social outcast.His own father and mother
had turned on him--his brother and sisters, society, his friends.Dear heaven, what a to-do this action of his had created!Why, even
the fates seemed adverse.His real estate venture was one of the most
fortuitously unlucky things he had ever heard of.Were the gods
battling on the side of a to him unimportant social arrangement?Anyhow, he had been compelled to quit, and here he was,
vigorous, determined, somewhat battered by the experience, but still
forceful and worth while.And it was a part of the penalty that he had become measurably
soured by what had occurred.He was feeling that he had been compelled
to do the first ugly, brutal thing of his life.It was a shame to forsake her after all the devotion she had
manifested.Truly she had played a finer part than he.Worst of all,
his deed could not be excused on the grounds of necessity.He could
have lived on ten thousand a year; he could have done without the
million and more which was now his.He could have done without the
society, the pleasures of which had always been a lure.He could have,
but he had not, and he had complicated it all with the thought of
another woman.That was a question which always rose
before him.Wasn't she deliberately scheming under
his very eyes to win him away from the woman who was as good as his
wife?Was it the thing a truly big woman would do?Ought he
to marry any one seeing that he really owed a spiritual if not a legal
allegiance to Jennie?Was it worth while for any woman to marry him?He could not shut
out the fact that he was doing a cruel and unlovely thing.Material error in the first place was now being complicated with
spiritual error.He was attempting to right the first by committing
the second.He was
thinking, thinking, all the while he was readjusting his life to the
old (or perhaps better yet, new) conditions, and he was not feeling
any happier.As a matter of fact he was feeling worse--grim,
revengeful.If he married Letty he thought at times it would be to use
her fortune as a club to knock other enemies over the head, and he
hated to think he was marrying her for that.He took up his abode at
the Auditorium, visited Cincinnati in a distant and aggressive spirit,
sat in council with the board of directors, wishing that he was more
at peace with himself, more interested in life.But he did not change
his policy in regard to Jennie.Gerald had been vitally interested in Lester's
rehabilitation.She waited tactfully some little time before sending
him any word; finally she ventured to write to him at the Hyde Park
address (as if she did not know where he was), asking, "Where are
you?"By this time Lester had become slightly accustomed to the change
in his life.He was saying to himself that he needed sympathetic
companionship, the companionship of a woman, of course.Social
invitations had begun to come to him now that he was alone and that
his financial connections were so obviously restored.He had made his
appearance, accompanied only by a Japanese valet, at several country
houses, the best sign that he was once more a single man.No reference
was made by any one to the past.Gerald's note he decided that he ought to go and
see her.For months preceding his
separation from Jennie he had not gone near her.Even now he waited
until time brought a 'phoned invitation to dinner.Gerald was at her best as a hostess at her perfectly appointed
dinner-table.Alboni, the pianist, was there on this occasion,
together with Adam Rascavage, the sculptor, a visiting scientist from
England, Sir Nelson Keyes, and, curiously enough, Mr.Berry
Dodge, whom Lester had not met socially in several years.Gerald
and Lester exchanged the joyful greetings of those who understand each
other thoroughly and are happy in each other's company."Aren't you
ashamed of yourself, sir," she said to him when he made his
appearance, "to treat me so indifferently?You are going to be
punished for this."I
suppose something like ninety stripes will serve me about right."What is it they do to evil-doers in Siam?""Boil them in oil, I suppose.""Well, anyhow, that's more like."Be sure and tell me when you decide," he laughed, and passed on to
be presented to distinguished strangers by Mrs.Lester was always at his ease
intellectually, and this mental atmosphere revived him.Presently he
turned to greet Berry Dodge, who was standing at his elbow."We
haven't seen you in--oh, when?Dodge is waiting to have a
word with you."Lester noticed the change in Dodge's attitude."Some time, that's sure," he replied easily."I'm living at the
Auditorium.""I was asking after you the other day.We were thinking of running up into Canada for some
hunting.He had seen Lester's election as a
director of the C. H.& D. Obviously he was coming back into the
world.But dinner was announced and Lester sat at Mrs."Aren't you coming to pay me a dinner call some afternoon after
this?"Gerald confidentially when the conversation was
brisk at the other end of the table."I am, indeed," he replied, "and shortly.Seriously, I've been
wanting to look you up.He felt as if he must talk with her; he
was feeling bored and lonely; his long home life with Jennie had made
hotel life objectionable.He felt as though he must find a
sympathetic, intelligent ear, and where better than here?Letty was
all ears for his troubles.She would have pillowed his solid head upon
her breast in a moment if that had been possible."Well," he said, when the usual fencing preliminaries were over,
"what will you have me say in explanation?""I'm not so sure," he replied gravely."And I can't say that I'm
feeling any too joyous about the matter as a whole.""I knew how it would be with you.I can see you wading through this mentally, Lester.I have been
watching you, every step of the way, wishing you peace of mind.These
things are always so difficult, but don't you know I am still sure
it's for the best.You couldn't afford to sink back into a mere shell-fish life.You
are not organized temperamentally for that any more than I am.You may
regret what you are doing now, but you would have regretted the other
thing quite as much and more.You couldn't work your life out that
way--now, could you?""I don't know about that, Letty.I've wanted to
come and see you for a long time, but I didn't think that I ought to.The fight was outside--you know what I mean.""Yes, indeed, I do," she said soothingly.I don't know whether
this financial business binds me sufficiently or not.I'll be frank
and tell you that I can't say I love her entirely; but I'm sorry, and
that's something.""She's comfortably provided for, of course," she commented rather
than inquired.She's retiring by nature and doesn't care for show.I've taken a cottage for her at Sandwood, a little place north of here
on the lake; and there's plenty of money in trust, but, of course, she
knows she can live anywhere she pleases.""I understand exactly how she feels, Lester.She is going to suffer very keenly for a while--we all do when we
have to give up the thing we love.But we can get over it, and we do.It will go hard at first, but after a
while she will see how it is, and she won't feel any the worse toward
you.""Jennie will never reproach me, I know that," he replied."I'm the
one who will do the reproaching.The trouble is with my particular turn of mind.I can't tell, for the
life of me, how much of this disturbing feeling of mine is
habit--the condition that I'm accustomed to--and how much is
sympathy.I sometimes think I'm the the most pointless individual in
the world.You're lonely living where you are, aren't you?""Why not come and spend a few days down at West Baden?"I could come Thursday, for a few days."We can walk and talk things out
down there.She came toward him, trailing a lavender lounging robe."You're
such a solemn philosopher, sir," she observed comfortably, "working
through all the ramifications of things."I can't help it," he replied."Well, one thing I know--" and she tweaked his ear gently."You're not going to make another mistake through sympathy if I can
help it," she said daringly."You're going to stay disentangled long
enough to give yourself a chance to think out what you want to do.And I wish for one thing you'd take over the management of my
affairs.You could advise me so much better than my lawyer."He arose and walked to the window, turning to look back at her
solemnly."I know what you want," he said doggedly.She
looked at him pleadingly, defiantly."You don't know what you're doing," he grumbled; but he kept on
looking at her; she stood there, attractive as a woman of her age
could be, wise, considerate, full of friendship and affection."You ought not to want to marry me.It won't be
worth anything in the long run.""It will be worth something to me," she insisted.Finally he drew her to him, and
put his arms about her waist.he said; "I'm not worth
it."No, I'll not," she replied.I don't care
what you think you are worth.""If you keep on I venture to say you'll have me," he returned."Oh," she exclaimed, and hid her hot face against his breast."This is bad business," he thought, even as he held her within the
circle of his arms."It isn't what I ought to be doing."Still he held her, and now when she offered her lips coaxingly he
kissed her again and again.CHAPTER LVI


It is difficult to say whether Lester might not have returned to
Jennie after all but for certain influential factors.After a time,
with his control of his portion of the estate firmly settled in his
hands and the storm of original feeling forgotten, he was well aware
that diplomacy--if he ignored his natural tendency to fulfil even
implied obligations--could readily bring about an arrangement
whereby he and Jennie could be together.But he was haunted by the
sense of what might be called an important social opportunity in the
form of Mrs.He was compelled to set over against his natural
tendency toward Jennie a consciousness of what he was ignoring in the
personality and fortunes of her rival, who was one of the most
significant and interesting figures on the social horizon.For think
as he would, these two women were now persistently opposed in his
consciousness.The one polished, sympathetic,
philosophic--schooled in all the niceties of polite society, and
with the means to gratify her every wish; the other natural,
sympathetic, emotional, with no schooling in the ways of polite
society, but with a feeling for the beauty of life and the lovely
things in human relationship which made her beyond any question an
exceptional woman.Her criticism
of Lester's relationship with Jennie was not that she was not worth
while, but that conditions made it impolitic.On the other hand, union
with her was an ideal climax for his social aspirations.He would be as happy with her as he would
be with Jennie--almost--and he would have the satisfaction
of knowing that this Western social and financial world held no more
significant figure than himself.It was not wise to delay either this
latter excellent solution of his material problems, and after thinking
it over long and seriously he finally concluded that he would not.He
had already done Jennie the irreparable wrong of leaving her.What
difference did it make if he did this also?She was possessed of
everything she could possibly want outside of himself.She had herself
deemed it advisable for him to leave.By such figments of the brain,
in the face of unsettled and disturbing conditions, he was becoming
used to the idea of a new alliance.The thing which prevented an eventual resumption of relationship in
some form with Jennie was the constant presence of Mrs.Circumstances conspired to make her the logical solution of his mental
quandary at this time.Alone he could do nothing save to make visits
here and there, and he did not care to do that.He was too indifferent
mentally to gather about him as a bachelor that atmosphere which he
enjoyed and which a woman like Mrs.Their home then, wherever it
was, would be full of clever people.He would need to do little save
to appear and enjoy it.She understood quite as well as any one how he
liked to live.She enjoyed to meet the people he enjoyed meeting.There were so many things they could do together nicely.He visited
West Baden at the same time she did, as she suggested.He gave himself
over to her in Chicago for dinners, parties, drives.Her house was
quite as much his own as hers--she made him feel so.She talked
to him about her affairs, showing him exactly how they stood and why
she wished him to intervene in this and that matter.She did not wish
him to be much alone.She did not want him to think or regret.She
came to represent to him comfort, forgetfulness, rest from care.With
the others he visited at her house occasionally, and it gradually
became rumored about that he would marry her.Because of the fact that
there had been so much discussion of his previous relationship, Letty
decided that if ever this occurred it should be a quiet affair.She
wanted a simple explanation in the papers of how it had come about,
and then afterward, when things were normal again and gossip had
subsided, she would enter on a dazzling social display for his
sake."Why not let us get married in April and go abroad for the summer?"she asked once, after they had reached a silent understanding that
marriage would eventually follow.Then we can come
back in the fall, and take a house on the drive."Lester had been away from Jennie so long now that the first severe
wave of self-reproach had passed.He was still doubtful, but he
preferred to stifle his misgivings."Very well," he replied, almost
jokingly."Only don't let there be any fuss about it."she exclaimed, looking over at
him; they had been spending the evening together quietly reading and
chatting."I've thought about it a long while," he replied.She came over to him and sat on his knee, putting her arms upon his
shoulders."I can scarcely believe you said that," she said, looking at him
curiously.But my, what a
trousseau I will prepare!"He smiled a little constrainedly as she tousled his head; there was
a missing note somewhere in this gamut of happiness; perhaps it was
because he was getting old.CHAPTER LVII


In the meantime Jennie was going her way, settling herself in the
markedly different world in which henceforth she was to move.It
seemed a terrible thing at first--this life without Lester.Despite her own strong individuality, her ways had become so involved
with his that there seemed to be no possibility of disentangling them.Constantly she was with him in thought and action, just as though they
had never separated.In the mornings when she woke it was with
the sense that he must be beside her.At night as if she could not go
to bed alone.He would come after a while surely--ah, no, of
course he would not come.Again there were so many little trying things to adjust, for a
change of this nature is too radical to be passed over lightly.The
explanation she had to make to Vesta was of all the most important.This little girl, who was old enough now to see and think for herself,
was not without her surmises and misgivings.Vesta recalled that her
mother had been accused of not being married to her father when she
was born.She had seen the article about Jennie and Lester in the
Sunday paper at the time it had appeared--it had been shown to
her at school--but she had had sense enough to say nothing about
it, feeling somehow that Jennie would not like it.Lester's
disappearance was a complete surprise; but she had learned in the last
two or three years that her mother was very sensitive, and that she
could hurt her in unexpected ways.Jennie was finally compelled to
tell Vesta that Lester's fortune had been dependent on his leaving
her, solely because she was not of his station.Vesta listened soberly
and half suspected the truth.She felt terribly sorry for her mother,
and, because of Jennie's obvious distress, she was trebly gay and
courageous.She refused outright the suggestion of going to a
boarding-school and kept as close to her mother as she could.She
found interesting books to read with her, insisted that they go to see
plays together, played to her on the piano, and asked for her mother's
criticisms on her drawing and modeling.She found a few friends in the
excellent Sand wood school, and brought them home of an evening to add
lightness and gaiety to the cottage life.Jennie, through her growing
appreciation of Vesta's fine character, became more and more drawn
toward her.Lester was gone, but at least she had Vesta.That prop
would probably sustain her in the face of a waning existence.There was also her history to account for to the residents of
Sandwood.In many cases where one is content to lead a secluded life
it is not necessary to say much of one's past, but as a rule something
must be said.People have the habit of inquiring--if they are no
more than butchers and bakers.By degrees one must account for this
and that fact, and it was so here.She could not say that her husband
was dead.She had to say that she had left
him--to give the impression that it would be she, if any one, who
would permit him to return.This put her in an interesting and
sympathetic light in the neighborhood.It was the most sensible thing
to do.She then settled down to a quiet routine of existence, waiting
what denouement to her life she could not guess.Sandwood life was not without its charms for a lover of nature, and
this, with the devotion of Vesta, offered some slight solace.There
was the beauty of the lake, which, with its passing boats, was a
never-ending source of joy, and there were many charming drives in the
surrounding country.Jennie had her own horse and carryall--one
of the horses of the pair they had used in Hyde Park.Other household
pets appeared in due course of time, including a collie, that Vesta
named Rats; she had brought him from Chicago as a puppy, and he had
grown to be a sterling watch-dog, sensible and affectionate.There was
also a cat, Jimmy Woods, so called after a boy Vesta knew, and to whom
she insisted the cat bore a marked resemblance.There was a singing
thrush, guarded carefully against a roving desire for bird-food on the
part of Jimmy Woods, and a jar of goldfish.So this little household
drifted along quietly and dreamily indeed, but always with the
undercurrent of feeling which ran so still because it was so deep.There was no word from Lester for the first few weeks following his
departure; he was too busy following up the threads of his new
commercial connections and too considerate to wish to keep Jennie in a
state of mental turmoil over communications which, under the present
circumstances, could mean nothing.He preferred to let matters rest
for the time being; then a little later he would write her sanely and
calmly of how things were going.He did this after the silence of a
month, saying that he had been pretty well pressed by commercial
affairs, that he had been in and out of the city frequently (which was
the truth), and that he would probably be away from Chicago a large
part of the time in the future.He inquired after Vesta and the
condition of affairs generally at Sandwood."I may get up there one of
these days," he suggested, but he really did not mean to come, and
Jennie knew that he did not.Another month passed, and then there was a second letter from him,
not so long as the first one.Jennie had written him frankly and
fully, telling him just how things stood with her.She concealed
entirely her own feelings in the matter, saying that she liked the
life very much, and that she was glad to be at Sand wood.She
expressed the hope that now everything was coming out for the best for
him, and tried to show him that she was really glad matters had been
settled."You mustn't think of me as being unhappy," she said in one
place, "for I'm not.I am sure it ought to be just as it is, and I
wouldn't be happy if it were any other way.Lay out your life so as to
give yourself the greatest happiness, Lester," she added.Whatever you do will be just right for me.Gerald in mind, and he suspected as much, but he felt that her
generosity must be tinged greatly with self-sacrifice and secret
unhappiness.It was the one thing which made him hesitate about taking
that final step.The written word and the hidden thought--how they conflict!After six months the correspondence was more or less perfunctory on
his part, and at eight it had ceased temporarily.One morning, as she was glancing over the daily paper, she saw
among the society notes the following item:

The engagement of Mrs.Malcolm Gerald, of 4044 Drexel Boulevard,
to Lester Kane, second son of the late Archibald Kane, of Cincinnati,
was formally announced at a party given by the prospective bride on
Tuesday to a circle of her immediate friends.For a few minutes she sat perfectly
still, looking straight ahead of her.She had known that it must
come, and yet--and yet she had always hoped that it would not.Had not she
herself suggested this very thing in a roundabout way?The idea was
objectionable to her.And yet he had set aside a goodly sum to be hers
absolutely.In the hands of a trust company in La Salle Street were
railway certificates aggregating seventy-five thousand dollars, which
yielded four thousand five hundred annually, the income being paid to
her direct.Jennie felt hurt through and through by this denouement, and yet as
she sat there she realized that it was foolish to be angry.Life was
always doing this sort of a thing to her.If she went out in the world and earned her own living
what difference would it make to him?Here she was walled in this little place, leading an
obscure existence, and there was he out in the great world enjoying
life in its fullest and freest sense.Her eyes indeed were dry, but her very soul seemed to be torn in
pieces within her.She rose carefully, hid the newspaper at the bottom
of a trunk, and turned the key upon it.CHAPTER LVIII


Now that his engagement to Mrs.Gerald was an accomplished, fact,
Lester found no particular difficulty in reconciling himself to the
new order of things; undoubtedly it was all for the best.He was sorry
for Jennie--very sorry.Gerald; but there was a
practical unguent to her grief in the thought that it was best for
both Lester and the girl.And
Jennie would eventually realize that she had done a wise and kindly
thing; she would be glad in the consciousness that she had acted so
unselfishly.Gerald, because of her indifference to the
late Malcolm Gerald, and because she was realizing the dreams of her
youth in getting Lester at last--even though a little
late--she was intensely happy.She could think of nothing finer
than this daily life with him--the places they would go, the
things they would see.Lester Kane
the following winter was going to be something worth remembering.And
as for Japan--that was almost too good to be true.Lester wrote to Jennie of his coming marriage to Mrs.He
said that he had no explanation to make.It wouldn't be worth anything
if he did make it.He
thought he ought to let her (Jennie) know.He
wanted her always to feel that he had her real interests at heart.He
would do anything in his power to make life as pleasant and agreeable
for her as possible.And would she
remember him affectionately to Vesta?She ought to be sent to a
finishing school.She knew that Lester had
been drawn to Mrs.Gerald from the time he met her at the Carlton in
London.She was glad to write and tell him
so, explaining that she had seen the announcement in the papers.Lester read her letter thoughtfully; there was more between the lines
than the written words conveyed.Her fortitude was a charm to him even
in this hour.In spite of all he had done and what he was now going to
do, he realized that he still cared for Jennie in a way.She was a
noble and a charming woman.If everything else had been all right he
would not be going to marry Mrs.The ceremony was performed on April fifteenth, at the residence of
Mrs.Gerald, a Roman Catholic priest officiating.Lester was a poor
example of the faith he occasionally professed.He was an agnostic,
but because he had been reared in the church he felt that he might as
well be married in it.Some fifty guests, intimate friends, had been
invited.There were
jubilant congratulations and showers of rice and confetti.While the
guests were still eating and drinking Lester and Letty managed to
escape by a side entrance into a closed carriage, and were off.Fifteen minutes later there was pursuit pell-mell on the part of the
guests to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific depot; but by that time
the happy couple were in their private car, and the arrival of the
rice throwers made no difference.More champagne was opened; then the
starting of the train ended all excitement, and the newly wedded pair
were at last safely off."Well, now you have me," said Lester, cheerfully pulling Letty down
beside him into a seat, "what of it?""This of it," she exclaimed, and hugged him close, kissing him
fervently.In four days they were in San Francisco, and two days later
on board a fast steamship bound for the land of the Mikado.In the meanwhile Jennie was left to brood.The original
announcement in the newspapers had said that he was to be married in
April, and she had kept close watch for additional information.Finally she learned that the wedding would take place on April
fifteenth at the residence of the prospective bride, the hour being
high noon.In spite of her feeling of resignation, Jennie followed it
all hopelessly, like a child, hungry and forlorn, looking into a
lighted window at Christmas time.On the day of the wedding she waited miserably for twelve o'clock
to strike; it seemed as though she were really present--and
looking on.She could see in her mind's eye the handsome residence,
the carriages, the guests, the feast, the merriment, the
ceremony--all.Telepathically and psychologically she received
impressions of the private car and of the joyous journey they were
going to take.The papers had stated that they would spend their
honeymoon in Japan.She could see her now--the new Mrs.Kane that ever was, lying in his arms.There was a solid lump in
her throat as she thought of this.She sighed to herself,
and clasped her hands forcefully; but it did no good.She was just as
miserable as before.When the day was over she was actually relieved; anyway, the deed
was done and nothing could change it.Vesta was sympathetically aware
of what was happening, but kept silent.She too had seen the report in
the newspaper.When the first and second day after had passed Jennie
was much calmer mentally, for now she was face to face with the
inevitable.But it was weeks before the sharp pain dulled to the old
familiar ache.Then there were months before they would be back again,
though, of course, that made no difference now.Only Japan seemed so
far off, and somehow she had liked the thought that Lester was near
her--somewhere in the city.The spring and summer passed, and now it was early in October.One
chilly day Vesta came home from school complaining of a headache.When
Jennie had given her hot milk--a favorite remedy of her
mother's--and had advised a cold towel for the back of her head,
Vesta went to her room and lay down.The following morning she had a
slight fever.This lingered while the local physician, Dr.Emory,
treated her tentatively, suspecting that it might be typhoid, of which
there were several cases in the village.This doctor told Jennie that
Vesta was probably strong enough constitutionally to shake it off, but
it might be that she would have a severe siege.Mistrusting her own
skill in so delicate a situation, Jennie sent to Chicago for a trained
nurse, and then began a period of watchfulness which was a combination
of fear, longing, hope, and courage.Now there could be no doubt; the disease was typhoid.Jennie
hesitated about communicating with Lester, who was supposed to be in
New York; the papers had said that he intended to spend the winter
there.But when the doctor, after watching the case for a week,
pronounced it severe, she thought she ought to write anyhow, for no
one could tell what would happen.Lester had been so fond of Vesta.The letter sent to him did not reach him, for at the time it
arrived he was on his way to the West Indies.Jennie was compelled to
watch alone by Vesta's sick-bed, for although sympathetic neighbors,
realizing the pathos of the situation were attentive, they could not
supply the spiritual consolation which only those who truly love us
can give.There was a period when Vesta appeared to be rallying, and
both the physician and the nurse were hopeful; but afterward she
became weaker.Emory that her heart and kidneys had
become affected.There came a time when the fact had to be faced that death was
imminent.The doctor's face was grave, the nurse was non-committal in
her opinion.Jennie hovered about, praying the only prayer that is
prayer--the fervent desire of her heart concentrated on the one
issue--that Vesta should get well.The child had come so close to
her during the last few years!She was
beginning to realize clearly what her life had been.And Jennie,
through her, had grown to a broad understanding of responsibility.She
knew now what it meant to be a good mother and to have children.If
Lester had not objected to it, and she had been truly married, she
would have been glad to have others.Again, she had always felt that
she owed Vesta so much--at least a long and happy life to make up
to her for the ignominy of her birth and rearing.Jennie had been so
happy during the past few years to see Vesta growing into beautiful,
graceful, intelligent womanhood.Emory
finally sent to Chicago for a physician friend of his, who came to
consider the case with him.He was an old man, grave, sympathetic,
understanding."The treatment has been correct," he
said."Her system does not appear to be strong enough to endure the
strain.Some physiques are more susceptible to this malady than
others."It was agreed that if within three days a change for the
better did not come the end was close at hand.No one can conceive the strain to which Jennie's spirit was
subjected by this intelligence, for it was deemed best that she should
know.She hovered about white-faced--feeling intensely, but
scarcely thinking.She seemed to vibrate consciously with Vesta's
altering states.If there was the least improvement she felt it
physically.If there was a decline her barometric temperament
registered the fact.Davis, a fine, motherly soul of fifty, stout and
sympathetic, who lived four doors from Jennie, and who understood
quite well how she was feeling.She had co-operated with the nurse and
doctor from the start to keep Jennie's mental state as nearly normal
as possible."Now, you just go to your room and lie down, Mrs.Kane," she would
say to Jennie when she found her watching helplessly at the bedside or
wandering to and fro, wondering what to do.Lord bless you, don't you
think I know?I've been the mother of seven and lost three.Jennie put her head on her big, warm shoulder one
day and cried.And she led her
to her sleeping-room.She came back after a few minutes
unrested and unrefreshed.Finally one midnight, when the nurse had
persuaded her that all would be well until morning anyhow, there came
a hurried stirring in the sick-room.Jennie was lying down for a few
minutes on her bed in the adjoining room.Davis had come in, and she and the nurse were conferring as to Vesta's
condition--standing close beside her.She came up and looked at her daughter keenly.Vesta's pale, waxen face told the story.She was breathing faintly,
her eyes closed."She's very weak," whispered the nurse.The moments passed, and after a time the clock in the hall struck
one.Miss Murfree, the nurse, moved to the medicine-table several
times, wetting a soft piece of cotton cloth with alcohol and bathing
Vesta's lips.At the striking of the half-hour there was a stir of the
weak body--a profound sigh."There, there, you poor dear," she
whispered when she began to shake.Jennie sank on her knees beside the bed and caressed Vesta's still
warm hand."Oh no, Vesta," she pleaded."There, dear, come now," soothed the voice of Mrs."Can't
you leave it all in God's hands?Can't you believe that everything is
for the best?"Jennie felt as if the earth had fallen.There
was no light anywhere in the immense darkness of her existence.CHAPTER LIX


This added blow from inconsiderate fortune was quite enough to
throw Jennie back into that state of hyper-melancholia from which she
had been drawn with difficulty during the few years of comfort and
affection which she had enjoyed with Lester in Hyde Park.It was
really weeks before she could realize that Vesta was gone.The
emaciated figure which she saw for a day or two after the end did not
seem like Vesta.Where was the joy and lightness, the quickness of
motion, the subtle radiance of health?Only this pale,
lily-hued shell--and silence.Jennie had no tears to shed; only a
deep, insistent pain to feel.If only some counselor of eternal wisdom
could have whispered to her that obvious and convincing
truth--there are no dead.Davis, and some others among the
neighbors were most sympathetic and considerate.Davis sent a
telegram to Lester saying that Vesta was dead, but, being absent,
there was no response.The house was looked after with scrupulous care
by others, for Jennie was incapable of attending to it herself.She
walked about looking at things which Vesta had owned or
liked--things which Lester or she had given her--sighing
over the fact that Vesta would not need or use them any more.She gave
instructions that the body should be taken to Chicago and buried in
the Cemetery of the Redeemer, for Lester, at the time of Gerhardt's
death, had purchased a small plot of ground there.She also expressed
her wish that the minister of the little Lutheran church in Cottage
Grove Avenue, where Gerhardt had attended, should be requested to say
a few words at the grave.There were the usual preliminary services at
the house.The local Methodist minister read a portion of the first
epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians, and a body of Vesta's classmates
sang "Nearer My God to Thee."There were flowers, a white coffin, a
world of sympathetic expressions, and then Vesta was taken away.The
coffin was properly incased for transportation, put on the train, and
finally delivered at the Lutheran cemetery in Chicago.She was dazed, almost to the point
of insensibility.Five of her neighborhood friends, at the
solicitation of Mrs.At the
grave-side when the body was finally lowered she looked at it, one
might have thought indifferently, for she was numb from suffering.She
returned to Sandwood after it was all over, saying that she would not
stay long.She wanted to come back to Chicago, where she could be near
Vesta and Gerhardt.After the funeral Jennie tried to think of her future.She fixed
her mind on the need of doing something, even though she did not need
to.She thought that she might like to try nursing, and could start at
once to obtain the training which was required.He was unmarried, and perhaps he might be willing to come and
live with her.Only she did not know where he was, and Bass was also
in ignorance of his whereabouts.She finally concluded that she would
try to get work in a store.She
could not live alone here, and she could not have her neighbors
sympathetically worrying over what was to become of her.Miserable as
she was, she would be less miserable stopping in a hotel in Chicago,
and looking for something to do, or living in a cottage somewhere near
the Cemetery of the Redeemer.It also occurred to her that she might
adopt a homeless child.There were a number of orphan asylums in the
city.Some three weeks after Vesta's death Lester returned to Chicago
with his wife, and discovered the first letter, the telegram, and an
additional note telling him that Vesta was dead.He was truly grieved,
for his affection for the girl had been real.He was very sorry for
Jennie, and he told his wife that he would have to go out and see her.Perhaps
he could suggest something which would help her.He took the train to
Sandwood, but Jennie had gone to the Hotel Tremont in Chicago.He went
there, but Jennie had gone to her daughter's grave; later he called
again and found her in.When the boy presented his card she suffered
an upwelling of feeling--a wave that was more intense than that
with which she had received him in the olden days, for now her need of
him was greater.Lester, in spite of the glamor of his new affection and the
restoration of his wealth, power, and dignities, had had time to think
deeply of what he had done.His original feeling of doubt and
dissatisfaction with himself had never wholly quieted.It did not ease
him any to know that he had left Jennie comfortably fixed, for it was
always so plain to him that money was not the point at issue with her.Without it she was like a rudderless
boat on an endless sea, and he knew it.She needed him, and he was
ashamed to think that his charity had not outweighed his sense of
self-preservation and his desire for material advantage.To-day as the
elevator carried him up to her room he was really sorry, though he
knew now that no act of his could make things right.He had been to
blame from the very beginning, first for taking her, then for failing
to stick by a bad bargain.The best
thing he could do was to be fair, to counsel with her, to give her the
best of his sympathy and advice."Hello, Jennie," he said familiarly as she opened the door to him
in her hotel room, his glance taking in the ravages which death and
suffering had wrought.She was thinner, her face quite drawn and
colorless, her eyes larger by contrast."I'm awfully sorry about
Vesta," he said a little awkwardly."I never dreamed anything like
that could happen."It was the first word of comfort which had meant anything to her
since Vesta died--since Lester had left her, in fact.It touched
her that he had come to sympathize; for the moment she could not
speak.Tears welled over her eyelids and down upon her cheeks."Don't cry, Jennie," he said, putting his arm around her and
holding her head to his shoulder.I've been sorry for a
good many things that can't be helped now."Beside papa," she said, sobbing."Too bad," he murmured, and held her in silence.She finally gained
control of herself sufficiently to step away from him; then wiping her
eyes with her handkerchief, she asked him to sit down."I'm so sorry," he went on, "that this should have happened while I
was away.I would have been with you if I had been here.I suppose you
won't want to live out at Sand wood now?""I can't, Lester," she replied.I didn't want to be a bother to those people
out there.I thought I'd get a little house somewhere and adopt a baby
maybe, or get something to do."That isn't a bad idea," he said, "that of adopting a baby.It
would be a lot of company for you.You know how to go about getting
one?""You just ask at one of these asylums, don't you?""I think there's something more than that," he replied
thoughtfully."There are some formalities--I don't know what they
are.They try to keep control of the child in some way.You had better
consult with Watson and get him to help you.Pick out your baby, and
then let him do the rest.Lester saw that she needed companionship badly."He's in Rochester, but he couldn't come.Bass said he was
married," she added."There isn't any other member of the family you could persuade to
come and live with you?""I might get William, but I don't know where he is.""Why not try that new section west of Jackson Park," he suggested,
"if you want a house here in Chicago?I see some nice cottages out
that way.Just rent until you see how well you're
satisfied."Jennie thought this good advice because it came from Lester.It was
good of him to take this much interest in her affairs.She wasn't
entirely separated from him after all.She asked
him how his wife was, whether he had had a pleasant trip, whether he
was going to stay in Chicago.All the while he was thinking that he
had treated her badly.He went to the window and looked down into
Dearborn Street, the world of traffic below holding his attention.The
great mass of trucks and vehicles, the counter streams of hurrying
pedestrians, seemed like a puzzle.It was
growing dusk, and lights were springing up here and there."I want to tell you something, Jennie," said Lester, finally
rousing himself from his fit of abstraction."I may seem peculiar to
you, after all that has happened, but I still care for you--in my
way.I've thought of you right along since I left.I thought it good
business to leave you--the way things were.I thought I liked
Letty well enough to marry her.From one point of view it still seems
best, but I'm not so much happier.I was just as happy with you as I
ever will be.It isn't myself that's important in this transaction
apparently; the individual doesn't count much in the situation.I
don't know whether you see what I'm driving at, but all of us are more
or less pawns.We're moved about like chessmen by circumstances over
which we have no control.""After all, life is more or less of a farce," he went on a little
bitterly.The best we can do is to hold our
personality intact.It doesn't appear that integrity has much to do
with it."Jennie did not quite grasp what he was talking about, but she knew
it meant that he was not entirely satisfied with himself and was sorry
for her."Don't worry over me, Lester," she consoled."I'm all right; I'll
get along.It did seem terrible to me for a while--getting used
to being alone."I want you to feel that my attitude hasn't changed," he continued
eagerly.Mrs.--Letty
understands that.When you get settled I'll
come in and see how you're fixed.I'll come around here again in a few
days.You understand how I feel, don't you?"He took her hand, turning it sympathetically in his own."Don't
worry," he said."I don't want you to do that.You're still Jennie to me, if you don't mind.I'm pretty bad, but I'm
not all bad."You probably are happy since--"

"Now, Jennie," he interrupted; then he pressed affectionately her
hand, her arm, her shoulder."Want to kiss me for old times' sake?"She put her hands over his shoulders, looked long into his eyes,
then kissed him.Jennie saw his agitation, and tried hard to speak."You'd better go now," she said firmly.He went away, and yet he knew that he wanted above all things to
remain; she was still the one woman in the world for him.And Jennie
felt comforted even though the separation still existed in all its
finality.She did not endeavor to explain or adjust the moral and
ethical entanglements of the situation.She was not, like so many,
endeavoring to put the ocean into a tea-cup, or to tie up the shifting
universe in a mess of strings called law.Lester still cared for her a
little.She had hoped once
that he might want her only.Since he did not, was his affection worth
nothing?She could not think, she could not feel that.CHAPTER LX


The drift of events for a period of five years carried Lester and
Jennie still farther apart; they settled naturally into their
respective spheres, without the renewal of the old time relationship
which their several meetings at the Tremont at first seemed to
foreshadow.Lester was in the thick of social and commercial affairs;
he walked in paths to which Jennie's retiring soul had never aspired.Jennie's own existence was quiet and uneventful.There was a simple
cottage in a very respectable but not showy neighborhood near Jackson
Park, on the South Side, where she lived in retirement with a little
foster-child--a chestnut-haired girl taken from the Western Home
for the Friendless--as her sole companion.J. G. Stover, for she had deemed it best to abandon the name of
Kane.Lester Kane when resident in Chicago were the
occupants of a handsome mansion on the Lake Shore Drive, where
parties, balls, receptions, dinners were given in rapid and at times
almost pyrotechnic succession.Lester, however, had become in his way a lover of a peaceful and
well-entertained existence.He had cut from his list of acquaintances
and associates a number of people who had been a little doubtful or
overfamiliar or indifferent or talkative during a certain period which
to him was a memory merely.He was a director, and in several cases
the chairman of a board of directors, in nine of the most important
financial and commercial organizations of the West--The United
Traction Company of Cincinnati, The Western Crucible Company, The
United Carriage Company, The Second National Bank of Chicago, the
First National Bank of Cincinnati, and several others of equal
importance.He was never a personal factor in the affairs of The
United Carriage Company, preferring to be represented by
counsel--Mr.Dwight L. Watson, but he took a keen interest in its
affairs.He had not seen his brother Robert to speak to him in seven
years.He had not seen Imogene, who lived in Chicago, in three.Louise, Amy, their husbands, and some of their closest acquaintances
were practically strangers.The firm of Knight, Keatley & O'Brien
had nothing whatever to do with his affairs.The truth was that Lester, in addition to becoming a little
phlegmatic, was becoming decidedly critical in his outlook on life.He
could not make out what it was all about.In distant ages a queer
thing had come to pass.There had started on its way in the form of
evolution a minute cellular organism which had apparently reproduced
itself by division, had early learned to combine itself with others,
to organize itself into bodies, strange forms of fish, animals, and
birds, and had finally learned to organize itself into man.Man, on
his part, composed as he was of self-organizing cells, was pushing
himself forward into comfort and different aspects of existence by
means of union and organization with other men.Here he was endowed with a peculiar brain and a certain amount of
talent, and he had inherited a certain amount of wealth which he now
scarcely believed he deserved, only luck had favored him.But he could
not see that any one else might be said to deserve this wealth any
more than himself, seeing that his use of it was as conservative and
constructive and practical as the next one's.He might have been born
poor, in which case he would have been as well satisfied as the next
one--not more so.Why should he complain, why worry, why
speculate?--the world was going steadily forward of its own
volition, whether he would or no.And was there any need
for him to disturb himself about it?He fancied at
times that it might as well never have been started at all."The one
divine, far-off event" of the poet did not appeal to him as having any
basis in fact.Lester Kane was of very much the same opinion.Jennie, living on the South Side with her adopted child, Rose
Perpetua, was of no fixed conclusion as to the meaning of life.She
had not the incisive reasoning capacity of either Mr.She had seen a great deal, suffered a great deal, and had read
some in a desultory way.Her mind had never grasped the nature and
character of specialized knowledge.History, physics, chemistry,
botany, geology, and sociology were not fixed departments in her brain
as they were in Lester's and Letty's.Instead there was the feeling
that the world moved in some strange, unstable way.Apparently no one
knew clearly what it was all about.Some
believed that the world had been made six thousand years before; some
that it was millions of years old.Was it all blind chance, or was
there some guiding intelligence--a God?Almost in spite of
herself she felt there must be something--a higher power which
produced all the beautiful things--the flowers, the stars, the
trees, the grass.If at times life seemed
cruel, yet this beauty still persisted.The thought comforted her; she
fed upon it in her hours of secret loneliness.It has been said that Jennie was naturally of an industrious turn.She liked to be employed, though she thought constantly as she worked.She was of matronly proportions in these days--not disagreeably
large, but full bodied, shapely, and smooth-faced in spite of her
cares.Her hair was still of a rich
brown, but there were traces of gray in it.Her neighbors spoke of her
as sweet-tempered, kindly, and hospitable.They knew nothing of her
history, except that she had formerly resided in Sandwood, and before
that in Cleveland.She was very reticent as to her past.Jennie had fancied, because of her natural aptitude for taking care
of sick people, that she might get to be a trained nurse.But she was
obliged to abandon that idea, for she found that only young people
were wanted.She also thought that some charitable organization might
employ her, but she did not understand the new theory of charity which
was then coming into general acceptance and practice--namely,
only to help others to help themselves.She believed in giving, and
was not inclined to look too closely into the credentials of those who
asked for help; consequently her timid inquiry at one relief agency
after another met with indifference, if not unqualified rebuke.She
finally decided to adopt another child for Rose Perpetua's sake; she
succeeded in securing a boy, four years old, who was known as
Henry--Henry Stover.Her support was assured, for her income was
paid to her through a trust company.She had no desire for speculation
or for the devious ways of trade.The care of flowers, the nature of
children, the ordering of a home were more in her province.One of the interesting things in connection with this separation
once it had been firmly established related to Robert and Lester, for
these two since the reading of the will a number of years before had
never met.He had followed
his success since he had left Jennie with interest.Gerald with pleasure; he had always considered her an
ideal companion for his brother.He knew by many signs and tokens that
his brother, since the unfortunate termination of their father's
attitude and his own peculiar movements to gain control of the Kane
Company, did not like him.Still they had never been so far apart
mentally--certainly not in commercial judgment.Lester was
prosperous now.And after all, he had done his best to aid his brother to
come to his senses--and with the best intentions.There were
mutual interests they could share financially if they were friends.He
wondered from time to time if Lester would not be friendly with
him.Time passed, and then once, when he was in Chicago, he made the
friends with whom he was driving purposely turn into the North Shore
in order to see the splendid mansion which the Kanes occupied.He knew
its location from hearsay and description.When he saw it a touch of the old Kane home atmosphere came back to
him.Lester in revising the property after purchase had had a
conservatory built on one side not unlike the one at home in
Cincinnati.That same night he sat down and wrote Lester asking if he
would not like to dine with him at the Union Club.He was only in town
for a day or two, and he would like to see him again.There was some
feeling he knew, but there was a proposition he would like to talk to
him about.On the receipt of this letter Lester frowned and fell into a brown
study.He had never really been healed of the wound that his father
had given him.He had never been comfortable in his mind since Robert
had deserted him so summarily.He realized now that the stakes his
brother had been playing for were big.But, after all, he had been his
brother, and if he had been in Robert's place at the time, he would
not have done as he had done; at least he hoped not.Then he thought he would
write and say no.But a curious desire to see Robert again, to hear
what he had to say, to listen to the proposition he had to offer, came
over him; he decided to write yes.They might agree to let by-gones be by-gones, but
the damage had been done.Could a broken bowl be mended and called
whole?It might be called whole, but what of it?He wrote and intimated that he would come.On the Thursday in question Robert called up from the Auditorium to
remind him of the engagement.Lester listened curiously to the sound
of his voice."All right," he said, "I'll be with you."At noon he
went down-town, and there, within the exclusive precincts of the Union
Club, the two brothers met and looked at each other again.Robert was
thinner than when Lester had seen him last, and a little grayer.His
eyes were bright and steely, but there were crow's-feet on either
side.Lester was noticeably of
another type--solid, brusque, and indifferent.Men spoke of
Lester these days as a little hard.Robert's keen blue eyes did not
disturb him in the least--did not affect him in any way.He saw
his brother just as he was, for he had the larger philosophic and
interpretative insight; but Robert could not place Lester exactly.He
could not fathom just what had happened to him in these years.Lester
was stouter, not gray, for some reason, but sandy and ruddy, looking
like a man who was fairly well satisfied to take life as he found it.Lester looked at his brother with a keen, steady eye.The latter
shifted a little, for he was restless.He could see that there was no
loss of that mental force and courage which had always been
predominant characteristics in Lester's make-up."I thought I'd like to see you again, Lester," Robert remarked,
after they had clasped hands in the customary grip."It's been a long
time now--nearly eight years, hasn't it?"I don't
often go to bed with anything."We don't see much of Ralph and Berenice since they married, but
the others are around more or less.I suppose your wife is all right,"
he said hesitatingly.Lester eyed him without a change of expression.They drifted mentally for a few moments, while Lester inquired
after the business, and Amy, Louise, and Imogene.He admitted frankly
that he neither saw nor heard from them nowadays."The thing that I was thinking of in connection with you, Lester,"
said Robert finally, "is this matter of the Western Crucible Steel
Company.You haven't been sitting there as a director in person I
notice, but your attorney, Watson, has been acting for you.The management isn't right--we all know that.We need
a practical steel man at the head of it, if the thing is ever going to
pay properly.I have voted my stock with yours right along because the
propositions made by Watson have been right.He agrees with me that
things ought to be changed.Now I have a chance to buy seventy shares
held by Rossiter's widow.That with yours and mine would give us
control of the company.I would like to have you take them, though it
doesn't make a bit of difference so long as it's in the family.You
can put any one you please in for president, and we'll make the thing
come out right."Watson had told him
that Robert's interests were co-operating with him.Lester had long
suspected that Robert would like to make up.This was the olive
branch--the control of a property worth in the neighborhood of a
million and a half."That's very nice of you," said Lester solemnly."It's a rather
liberal thing to do."Well, to tell you the honest truth, Lester," replied Robert, "I
never did feel right about that will business.I never did feel right
about that secretary-treasurership and some other things that have
happened.I don't want to rake up the past--you smile at
that--but I can't help telling you how I feel.I've been pretty
ambitious in the past.I was pretty ambitious just about the time that
father died to get this United Carriage scheme under way, and I was
afraid you might not like it.I have thought since that I ought not to
have done it, but I did.I suppose you're not anxious to hear any more
about that old affair.This other thing though--"

"Might be handed out as a sort of compensation," put in Lester
quietly."Not exactly that, Lester--though it may have something of
that in it.I know these things don't matter very much to you now.I
know that the time to do things was years ago--not now.Still I
thought sincerely that you might be interested in this proposition.Frankly, I thought it might patch up
matters between us."Yes," said Lester, "we're brothers."He was thinking as he said this of the irony of the situation.How
much had this sense of brotherhood been worth in the past?Robert had
practically forced him into his present relationship, and while Jennie
had been really the only one to suffer, he could not help feeling
angry.It was true that Robert had not cut him out of his one-fourth
of his father's estate, but certainly he had not helped him to get it,
and now Robert was thinking that this offer of his might mend things.It hurt him--Lester--a little."I can't see it, Robert," he said finally and determinedly."I can
appreciate the motive that prompts you to make this offer.But I can't
see the wisdom of my taking it.We can make all the changes you suggest if you take
the stock.I'm perfectly
willing to talk with you from time to time.This
other thing is simply a sop with which to plaster an old wound.You
want my friendship and so far as I'm concerned you have that.I don't
hold any grudge against you.He admired Lester in
spite of all that he had done to him--in spite of all that Lester
was doing to him now."I don't know but what you're right, Lester," he admitted finally."I didn't make this offer in any petty spirit though.I wanted to
patch up this matter of feeling between us.I won't say anything more
about it.You're not coming down to Cincinnati soon, are you?""I don't expect to," replied Lester."If you do I'd like to have you come and stay with us."I'll be glad to," he said, without emotion.But he remembered that
in the days of Jennie it was different.They would never have receded
from their position regarding her."Well," he thought, "perhaps I
can't blame them."I'll have to leave you soon," he said, looking at his
watch."I ought to go, too," said Robert."Well, anyhow," he
added, as they walked toward the cloakroom, "we won't be absolute
strangers in the future, will we?""I'll see you from time to time."There was a sense of
unsatisfied obligation and some remorse in Robert's mind as he saw his
brother walking briskly away.Why was it that
there was so much feeling between them--had been even before
Jennie had appeared?Then he remembered his old thoughts about "snaky
deeds."That was what his brother lacked, and that only.He was not
crafty; not darkly cruel, hence.On his part Lester went away feeling a slight sense of opposition
to, but also of sympathy for, his brother.He was not so terribly
bad--not different from other men.What would he
have done if he had been in Robert's place?He could see now how it all came about--why he had
been made the victim, why his brother had been made the keeper of the
great fortune."It's the way the world runs," he thought.CHAPTER LXI


The days of man under the old dispensation, or, rather, according
to that supposedly biblical formula, which persists, are threescore
years and ten.It is so ingrained in the race-consciousness by
mouth-to-mouth utterance that it seems the profoundest of truths.As a
matter of fact, man, even under his mortal illusion, is organically
built to live five times the period of his maturity, and would do so
if he but knew that it is spirit which endures, that age is an
illusion, and that there is no death.Yet the race-thought, gained
from what dream of materialism we know not, persists, and the death of
man under the mathematical formula so fearfully accepted is daily
registered.Lester was one of those who believed in this formula.He thought he had, say, twenty years more at the utmost
to live--perhaps not so long.No complaint or resistance would issue from
him.Life, in most of its aspects, was a silly show anyhow.He admitted that it was mostly illusion--easily proved to be
so.That it might all be one he sometimes suspected.It was very much
like a dream in its composition truly--sometimes like a very bad
dream.All he had to sustain him in his acceptance of its reality from
hour to hour and day to day was apparent contact with this material
proposition and that--people, meetings of boards of directors,
individuals and organizations planning to do this and that, his wife's
social functions Letty loved him as a fine, grizzled example of a
philosopher.She admired, as Jennie had, his solid, determined,
phlegmatic attitude in the face of troubled circumstance.All the
winds of fortune or misfortune could not apparently excite or disturb
Lester.He refused to budge from his
beliefs and feelings, and usually had to be pushed away from them,
still believing, if he were gotten away at all.He refused to do
anything save as he always said, "Look the facts in the face" and
fight.He could be made to fight easily enough if imposed upon, but
only in a stubborn, resisting way.His plan was to resist every effort
to coerce him to the last ditch.If he had to let go in the end he
would when compelled, but his views as to the value of not letting go
were quite the same even when he had let go under compulsion.His views of living were still decidedly material, grounded in
creature comforts, and he had always insisted upon having the best of
everything.If the furnishings of his home became the least dingy he
was for having them torn out and sold and the house done over.If he
traveled, money must go ahead of him and smooth the way.He did not
want argument, useless talk, or silly palaver as he called it.Every
one must discuss interesting topics with him or not talk at all.She would chuck him under the chin
mornings, or shake his solid head between her hands, telling him he
was a brute, but a nice kind of a brute."Yes, yes," he would growl.You're a seraphic suggestion of
attenuated thought.""No; you hush," she would reply, for at times he could cut like a
knife without really meaning to be unkind.Then he would pet her a
little, for, in spite of her vigorous conception of life, he realized
that she was more or less dependent upon him.It was always so plain
to her that he could get along without her.For reasons of kindliness
he was trying to conceal this, to pretend the necessity of her
presence, but it was so obvious that he really could dispense with her
easily enough.It was something, in
so shifty and uncertain a world, to be near so fixed and determined a
quantity as this bear-man.It was like being close to a warmly glowing
lamp in the dark or a bright burning fire in the cold.Lester was not
afraid of anything.He felt that he knew how to live and to die.It was natural that a temperament of this kind should have its
solid, material manifestation at every point.Having his financial
affairs well in hand, most of his holding being shares of big
companies, where boards of solemn directors merely approved the
strenuous efforts of ambitious executives to "make good," he had
leisure for living.He and Letty were fond of visiting the various
American and European watering-places.He gambled a little, for he
found that there was considerable diversion in risking interesting
sums on the spin of a wheel or the fortuitous roll of a ball; and he
took more and more to drinking, not in the sense that a drunkard takes
to it, but as a high liver, socially, and with all his friends.He was
inclined to drink the rich drinks when he did not take straight
whiskey--champagne, sparkling Burgundy, the expensive and
effervescent white wines.When he drank he could drink a great deal,
and he ate in proportion.Nothing must be served but the
best--soup, fish, entree, roast, game, dessert--everything
that made up a showy dinner and he had long since determined that only
a high-priced chef was worth while.They had found an old cordon
bleu, Louis Berdot, who had served in the house of one of the
great dry goods princes, and this man he engaged.He cost Lester a
hundred dollars a week, but his reply to any question was that he only
had one life to live.The trouble with this attitude was that it adjusted nothing,
improved nothing, left everything to drift on toward an indefinite
end.If Lester had married Jennie and accepted the comparatively
meager income of ten thousand a year he would have maintained the same
attitude to the end.It would have led him to a stolid indifference to
the social world of which now necessarily he was a part.He would have
drifted on with a few mentally compatible cronies who would have
accepted him for what he was--a good fellow--and Jennie in
the end would not have been so much better off than she was now.One of the changes which was interesting was that the Kanes
transferred their residence to New York.Kane had become very
intimate with a group of clever women in the Eastern four hundred, or
nine hundred, and had been advised and urged to transfer the scene of
her activities to New York.She finally did so, leasing a house in
Seventy-eighth Street, near Madison Avenue.She installed a novelty
for her, a complete staff of liveried servants, after the English
fashion, and had the rooms of her house done in correlative periods.Lester smiled at her vanity and love of show."You talk about your democracy," he grunted one day."You have as
much democracy as I have religion, and that's none at all."I'm merely accepting the logic of the situation."Do you call a butler and doorman in
red velvet a part of the necessity of the occasion?""Maybe not the necessity exactly,
but the spirit surely.You're the first one to
insist on perfection--to quarrel if there is any flaw in the
order of things.""Oh, I don't mean that literally.But you demand
perfection--the exact spirit of the occasion, and you know
it.""Maybe I do, but what has that to do with your democracy?"I'm as democratic in spirit as
any woman.Only I see things as they are, and conform as much as
possible for comfort's sake, and so do you.Don't you throw rocks at
my glass house, Mister Master.Yours is so transparent I can see every
move you make inside.""I'm democratic and you're not," he teased; but he approved
thoroughly of everything she did.She was, he sometimes fancied, a
better executive in her world than he was in his.Drifting in this fashion, wining, dining, drinking the waters of
this curative spring and that, traveling in luxurious ease and taking
no physical exercise, finally altered his body from a vigorous,
quick-moving, well-balanced organism into one where plethora of
substance was clogging every essential function.His liver, kidneys,
spleen, pancreas--every organ, in fact--had been overtaxed
for some time to keep up the process of digestion and elimination.In
the past seven years he had become uncomfortably heavy.His kidneys
were weak, and so were the arteries of his brain.By dieting, proper
exercise, the right mental attitude, he might have lived to be eighty
or ninety.As a matter of fact, he was allowing himself to drift into
a physical state in which even a slight malady might prove dangerous.It so happened that he and Letty had gone to the North Cape on a
cruise with a party of friends.Lester, in order to attend to some
important business, decided to return to Chicago late in November; he
arranged to have his wife meet him in New York just before the
Christmas holidays.He wrote Watson to expect him, and engaged rooms
at the Auditorium, for he had sold the Chicago residence some two
years before and was now living permanently in New York.One late November day, after having attended to a number of details
and cleared up his affairs very materially, Lester was seized with
what the doctor who was called to attend him described as a cold in
the intestines--a disturbance usually symptomatic of some other
weakness, either of the blood or of some organ.He suffered great
pain, and the usual remedies in that case were applied.There were
bandages of red flannel with a mustard dressing, and specifics were
also administered.He experienced some relief, but he was troubled
with a sense of impending disaster.He had Watson cable his
wife--there was nothing serious about it, but he was ill.A
trained nurse was in attendance and his valet stood guard at the door
to prevent annoyance of any kind.It was plain that Letty could not
reach Chicago under three weeks.He had the feeling that he would not
see her again.Curiously enough, not only because he was in Chicago, but because
he had never been spiritually separated from Jennie, he was thinking
about her constantly at this time.He had intended to go out and see
her just as soon as he was through with his business engagements and
before he left the city.He had asked Watson how she was getting
along, and had been informed that everything was well with her.She
was living quietly and looking in good health, so Watson said.Lester
wished he could see her.This thought grew as the days passed and he grew no better.He was
suffering from time to time with severe attacks of griping pains that
seemed to tie his viscera into knots, and left him very weak.Several
times the physician administered cocaine with a needle in order to
relieve him of useless pain.After one of the severe attacks he called Watson to his side, told
him to send the nurse away, and then said: "Watson, I'd like to have
you do me a favor.Stover if she won't come here to see me.Just send the nurse and Kozo (the valet)
away for the afternoon, or while she's here.If she comes at any other
time I'd like to have her admitted."He wondered what the world
would think if it could know of this bit of romance in connection with
so prominent a man.The latter was only too glad to serve him in any way.He called a carriage and rode out to Jennie's residence.He found
her watering some plants; her face expressed her surprise at his
unusual presence."I come on a rather troublesome errand, Mrs.Stover," he said,
using her assumed name.Kane is quite sick at
the Auditorium.His wife is in Europe, and he wanted to know if I
wouldn't come out here and ask you to come and see him.He wanted me
to bring you, if possible."Why yes," said Jennie, her face a study.An old Swedish housekeeper was in the kitchen.But there was coming back to her in detail a dream she
had had several nights before.It had seemed to her that she was out
on a dark, mystic body of water over which was hanging something like
a fog, or a pall of smoke.She heard the water ripple, or stir
faintly, and then out of the surrounding darkness a boat appeared.It
was a little boat, oarless, or not visibly propelled, and in it were
her mother, and Vesta, and some one whom she could not make out.Her
mother's face was pale and sad, very much as she had often seen it in
life.She looked at Jennie solemnly, sympathetically, and then
suddenly Jennie realized that the third occupant of the boat was
Lester.He looked at her gloomily--an expression she had never
seen on his face before--and then her mother remarked, "Well, we
must go now."The boat began to move, a great sense of loss came over
her, and she cried, "Oh, don't leave me, mamma!"But her mother only looked at her out of deep, sad, still eyes, and
the boat was gone.She woke with a start, half fancying that Lester was beside her.She stretched out her hand to touch his arm; then she drew herself up
in the dark and rubbed her eyes, realizing that she was alone.A great
sense of depression remained with her, and for two days it haunted
her.Then, when it seemed as if it were nothing, Mr.She went to dress, and reappeared, looking as troubled as were her
thoughts.She was very pleasing in her appearance yet, a sweet, kindly
woman, well dressed and shapely.She had never been separated mentally
from Lester, just as he had never grown entirely away from her.She
was always with him in thought, just as in the years when they were
together.Her fondest memories were of the days when he first courted
her in Cleveland--the days when he had carried her off, much as
the cave-man seized his mate--by force.Now she longed to do what
she could for him.For this call was as much a testimony as a shock.He loved her--he loved her, after all.The carriage rolled briskly through the long streets into the smoky
down-town district.It arrived at the Auditorium, and Jennie was
escorted to Lester's room.He had talked
little, leaving her to her thoughts.In this great hotel she felt
diffident after so long a period of complete retirement.As she
entered the room she looked at Lester with large, gray, sympathetic
eyes.He was lying propped up on two pillows, his solid head with its
growth of once dark brown hair slightly grayed.He looked at her
curiously out of his wise old eyes, a light of sympathy and affection
shining in them--weary as they were.His pale face, slightly drawn from suffering, cut her like
a knife.She took his hand, which was outside the coverlet, and
pressed it."I'm so sorry, Lester," she murmured.You're not
very sick though, are you?You must get well, Lester--and soon!""Yes, Jennie, but I'm pretty bad," he said."I don't feel right
about this business.I don't seem able to shake it off.But tell me,
how have you been?""Oh, just the same, dear," she replied.You mustn't
talk like that, though.You're going to be all right very soon
now."He shook his head, for he
thought differently."Sit down, dear," he went on, "I'm not worrying
about that.He
sighed and shut his eyes for a minute.She drew up a chair close beside the bed, her face toward his, and
took his hand.It seemed such a beautiful thing that he should send
for her.Her eyes showed the mingled sympathy, affection, and
gratitude of her heart.At the same time fear gripped her; how ill he
looked!"I can't tell what may happen," he went on.I've wanted to see you again for some time.We are living in New York, you know.You're a little stouter,
Jennie.""Yes, I'm getting old, Lester," she smiled."Oh, that doesn't make any difference," he replied, looking at her
fixedly.A slight twinge of pain
reminded him of the vigorous seizures he had been through.He couldn't
stand many more paroxysms like the last one."I couldn't go, Jennie, without seeing you again," he observed,
when the slight twinge ceased and he was free to think again."I've
always wanted to say to you, Jennie," he went on, "that I haven't been
satisfied with the way we parted.It wasn't the right thing, after
all.I wish now, for my own
peace of mind, that I hadn't done it.""Don't say that, Lester," she demurred, going over in her mind all
that had been between them.This was such a testimony to their real
union--their real spiritual compatibility.I wouldn't
have been satisfied to have you lose your fortune.I've been a lot better satisfied as it is.It's been hard, but,
dear, everything is hard at times."The thing wasn't worked out right
from the start; but that wasn't your fault.I'm glad I'm here to do it.""Don't talk that way, Lester--please don't," she pleaded.Why, when I think--" she
stopped, for it was hard for her to speak.She was choking with
affection and sympathy.She was recalling the
house he took for her family in Cleveland, his generous treatment of
Gerhardt, all the long ago tokens of love and kindness."Well, I've told you now, and I feel better.You're a good woman,
Jennie, and you're kind to come to me this way."It seems strange, but you're the
only woman I ever did love truly.It was the one thing she had waited for
all these years--this testimony.It was the one thing that could
make everything right--this confession of spiritual if not
material union."Oh, Lester,"
she exclaimed with a sob, and pressed his hand."Oh, they're lovely," she answered, entering upon a detailed
description of their diminutive personalities.He listened
comfortably, for her voice was soothing to him.When it came time for her to go he seemed
desirous of keeping her."I can stay just as well as not, Lester," she volunteered."You needn't do that," he said, but she could see that he wanted
her, that he did not want to be alone.From that time on until the hour of his death she was not out of
the hotel.CHAPTER LXII


The end came after four days during which Jennie was by his bedside
almost constantly.The nurse in charge welcomed her at first as a
relief and company, but the physician was inclined to object.Lester,
however, was stubborn."This is my death," he said, with a touch of
grim humor."If I'm dying I ought to be allowed to die in my own
way."Watson smiled at the man's unfaltering courage.He had never seen
anything like it before.There were cards of sympathy, calls of inquiry, notices in the
newspaper.Robert saw an item in the Inquirer and decided to go
to Chicago.Imogene called with her husband, and they were admitted to
Lester's room for a few minutes after Jennie had gone to hers.The nurse cautioned them that he was not to be
talked to much.When they were gone Lester said to Jennie, "Imogene
has changed a good deal."Kane was on the Atlantic three days out from New York the
afternoon Lester died.He had been meditating whether anything more
could be done for Jennie, but he could not make up his mind about it.Certainly it was useless to leave her more money.He had been wondering where Letty was and how near her actual arrival
might be when he was seized with a tremendous paroxysm of pain.Before
relief could be administered in the shape of an anesthetic he was
dead.It developed afterward that it was not the intestinal trouble
which killed him, but a lesion of a major blood-vessel in the
brain.Jennie, who had been strongly wrought up by watching and worrying,
was beside herself with grief.He had been a part of her thought and
feeling so long that it seemed now as though a part of herself had
died.She had loved him as she had fancied she could never love any
one, and he had always shown that he cared for her--at least in
some degree.She could not feel the emotion that expresses itself in
tears--only a dull ache, a numbness which seemed to make her
insensible to pain.He looked so strong--her Lester--lying
there still in death.His expression was unchanged--defiant,
determined, albeit peaceful.Kane that she
would arrive on the Wednesday following.Watson that it was to be transferred to
Cincinnati, where the Paces had a vault.Because of the arrival of
various members of the family, Jennie withdrew to her own home; she
could do nothing more.The final ceremonies presented a peculiar commentary on the
anomalies of existence.Kane by wire that
the body should be transferred to Imogene's residence, and the funeral
held from there.Robert, who arrived the night Lester died; Berry
Dodge, Imogene's husband; Mr.Midgely, and three other citizens of
prominence were selected as pall-bearers.Louise and her husband came
from Buffalo; Amy and her husband from Cincinnati.The house was full
to overflowing with citizens who either sincerely wished or felt it
expedient to call.Because of the fact that Lester and his family were
tentatively Catholic, a Catholic priest was called in and the ritual
of that Church was carried out.It was curious to see him lying in the
parlor of this alien residence, candles at his head and feet, burning
sepulchrally, a silver cross upon his breast, caressed by his waxen
fingers.He would have smiled if he could have seen himself, but the
Kane family was too conventional, too set in its convictions, to find
anything strange in this.She was greatly distraught, for her
love, like Jennie's, was sincere.She left her room that night when
all was silent and leaned over the coffin, studying by the light of
the burning candles Lester's beloved features.Tears trickled down her
cheeks, for she had been happy with him.She caressed his cold cheeks
and hands.No
one told her that he had sent for Jennie.Meanwhile in the house on South Park Avenue sat a woman who was
enduring alone the pain, the anguish of an irreparable loss.Through
all these years the subtle hope had persisted, in spite of every
circumstance, that somehow life might bring him back to her.He had
come, it is true--he really had in death--but he had gone
again.Whither her mother, whither Gerhardt, whither Vesta had
gone?She could not hope to see him again, for the papers had informed
her of his removal to Mrs.Midgely's residence, and of the fact that
he was to be taken from Chicago to Cincinnati for burial.The last
ceremonies in Chicago were to be held in one of the wealthy Roman
Catholic churches of the South Side, St.Michael's, of which the
Midgelys were members.She would have liked so much to have
had him buried in Chicago, where she could go to the grave
occasionally, but this was not to be.She was never a master of her
fate.She thought of him as being taken
from her finally by the removal of the body to Cincinnati, as though
distance made any difference.She decided at last to veil herself
heavily and attend the funeral at the church.The paper had explained
that the services would be at two in the afternoon.Then at four the
body would be taken to the depot, and transferred to the train; the
members of the family would accompany it to Cincinnati.A little before the time for the funeral cortege to arrive at the
church there appeared at one of its subsidiary entrances a woman in
black, heavily veiled, who took a seat in an inconspicuous corner.She
was a little nervous at first, for, seeing that the church was dark
and empty, she feared lest she had mistaken the time and place; but
after ten minutes of painful suspense a bell in the church tower began
to toll solemnly.Shortly thereafter an acolyte in black gown and
white surplice appeared and lighted groups of candles on either side
of the altar.A hushed stirring of feet in the choir-loft indicated
that the service was to be accompanied by music.Some loiterers,
attracted by the bell, some idle strangers, a few acquaintances and
citizens not directly invited appeared and took seats.Never in her life had
she been inside a Catholic church.The gloom, the beauty of the
windows, the whiteness of the altar, the golden flames of the candles
impressed her.She was suffused with a sense of sorrow, loss, beauty,
and mystery.Life in all its vagueness and uncertainty seemed typified
by this scene.As the bell tolled there came from the sacristy a procession of
altar-boys.The smallest, an angelic youth of eleven, came first,
bearing aloft a magnificent silver cross.In the hands of each
subsequent pair of servitors was held a tall, lighted candle.The
priest, in black cloth and lace, attended by an acolyte on either
hand, followed.The procession passed out the entrance into the
vestibule of the church, and was not seen again until the choir began
a mournful, responsive chant, the Latin supplication for mercy and
peace.Then, at this sound the solemn procession made its reappearance.There came the silver cross, the candles, the dark-faced priest,
reading dramatically to himself as he walked, and the body of Lester
in a great black coffin, with silver handles, carried by the
pall-bearers, who kept an even pace.Jennie stiffened perceptibly, her
nerves responding as though to a shock from an electric current.She
did not know any of these men.Of the long company of notables who followed two by
two she recognized only three, whom Lester had pointed out to her in
times past.Kane she saw, of course, for she was directly behind
the coffin, leaning on the arm of a stranger; behind her walked Mr.He gave a quick glance to either side,
evidently expecting to see her somewhere; but not finding her, he
turned his eyes gravely forward and walked on.Jennie looked with all
her eyes, her heart gripped by pain.She seemed so much a part of this
solemn ritual, and yet infinitely removed from it all.The procession reached the altar rail, and the coffin was put down.A white shroud bearing the insignia of suffering, a black cross, was
put over it, and the great candles were set beside it.There were the
chanted invocations and responses, the sprinkling of the coffin with
holy water, the lighting and swinging of the censer and then the
mumbled responses of the auditors to the Lord's Prayer and to its
Catholic addition, the invocation to the Blessed Virgin.Jennie was
overawed and amazed, but no show of form colorful, impression
imperial, could take away the sting of death, the sense of infinite
loss.To Jennie the candles, the incense, the holy song were
beautiful.They touched the deep chord of melancholy in her, and made
it vibrate through the depths of her being.She was as a house filled
with mournful melody and the presence of death.Kane was sobbing convulsively
also.When it was all over the carriages were entered and the body was
borne to the station.All the guests and strangers departed, and
finally, when all was silent, she arose.Now she would go to the depot
also, for she was hopeful of seeing his body put on the train.They
would have to bring it out on the platform, just as they did in
Vesta's case.She took a car, and a little later she entered the
waiting-room of the depot.She lingered about, first in the concourse,
where the great iron fence separated the passengers from the tracks,
and then in the waiting-room, hoping to discover the order of
proceedings.She finally observed the group of immediate relatives
waiting--Mrs.Midgely, Louise, Amy, Imogene,
and the others.She actually succeeded in identifying most of them,
though it was not knowledge in this case, but pure instinct and
intuition.No one had noticed it in the stress of excitement, but it was
Thanksgiving Eve.Throughout the great railroad station there was a
hum of anticipation, that curious ebullition of fancy which springs
from the thought of pleasures to come.Announcers were
calling in stentorian voices the destination of each new train as the
time of its departure drew near.Jennie heard with a desperate ache
the description of a route which she and Lester had taken more than
once, slowly and melodiously emphasized."Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland,
Buffalo, and New York."There were cries of trains for "Fort Wayne,
Columbus, Pittsburg, Philadelphia, and points East," and then finally
for "Indianapolis, Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points
South."Several times Jennie had gone to the concourse between the
waiting-room and the tracks to see if through the iron grating which
separated her from her beloved she could get one last look at the
coffin, or the great wooden box which held it, before it was put on
the train.There was a baggage porter pushing a
truck into position near the place where the baggage car would stop.On it was Lester, that last shadow of his substance, incased in the
honors of wood, and cloth, and silver.There was no thought on the
part of the porter of the agony of loss which was represented here.He
could not see how wealth and position in this hour were typified to
her mind as a great fence, a wall, which divided her eternally from
her beloved.Was not her life a patchwork
of conditions made and affected by these things which she
saw--wealth and force--which had found her unfit?She had
evidently been born to yield, not seek.This panoply of power had been
paraded before her since childhood.What could she do now but stare
vaguely after it as it marched triumphantly by?She looked through the
grating, and once more there came the cry of "Indianapolis,
Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points South."A long red train,
brilliantly lighted, composed of baggage cars, day coaches, a
dining-car, set with white linen and silver, and a half dozen
comfortable Pullmans, rolled in and stopped.A great black engine,
puffing and glowing, had it all safely in tow.As the baggage car drew near the waiting truck a train-hand in
blue, looking out of the car, called to some one within.All she could see was the great box that was so soon to disappear.All she could feel was that this train would start presently, and then
it would all be over.There were Robert, and Amy, and Louise, and Midgely--all making
for the Pullman cars in the rear.They had said their farewells to
their friends.A trio of assistants "gave a
hand" at getting the great wooden case into the car.Jennie saw it
disappear with an acute physical wrench at her heart.There were many trunks to be put aboard, and then the door of the
baggage car half closed, but not before the warning bell of the engine
sounded.There was the insistent calling of "all aboard" from this
quarter and that; then slowly the great locomotive began to move.Its
bell was ringing, its steam hissing, its smoke-stack throwing aloft a
great black plume of smoke that fell back over the cars like a pall.The fireman, conscious of the heavy load behind, flung open a flaming
furnace door to throw in coal.Jennie stood rigid, staring into the wonder of this picture, her
face white, her eyes wide, her hands unconsciously clasped, but one
thought in her mind--they were taking his body away.A leaden
November sky was ahead, almost dark.She looked, and looked until the
last glimmer of the red lamp on the receding sleeper disappeared in
the maze of smoke and haze overhanging the tracks of the
far-stretching yard."Yes," said the voice of a passing stranger, gay with the
anticipation of coming pleasures."We're going to have a great time
down there.Uncle Jim is coming and Aunt Ella."Jennie did not hear that or anything else of the chatter and bustle
around her.Before her was stretching a vista of lonely years down
which she was steadily gazing.There
were those two orphan children to raise.They would marry and leave
after a while, and then what?Days and days in endless reiteration,
and then--?You see I've done a little digging already--some years
ago--looking up the Blaisdell family.(By the way, that'll come in fine
now, won't it?)And an occasional letter from Bob has kept me posted as
to deaths and births in the Hillerton Blaisdells.I always meant to
hunt them up some time, they being my nearest kith and kin.Well, with
what I already had, and with what Bob has written me, I know these
facts."He paused, pulled a small notebook from his pocket, and consulted it."There are two sons and a daughter, children of Rufus Blaisdell.Rufus
died years ago, and his widow married a man by the name of Duff.The elder son is Frank Blaisdell.She's about forty-two or three, I
believe, and does dressmaking.James Blaisdell has a son, Fred,
seventeen, and two younger children.Frank Blaisdell has one daughter,
Mellicent.That's the extent of my knowledge, at present."Oh, anything's enough--for your purpose!You'll soon be reading in your morning paper that Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, the somewhat eccentric multi-millionaire, is about
to start for South America, and that it is hinted he is planning to
finance a gigantic exploring expedition.The accounts of what he's
going to explore will vary all the way from Inca antiquities to the
source of the Amazon.I've done a lot of talking to-day, and a good
deal of cautioning as to secrecy, etc.It ought to bear fruit by
to-morrow, or the day after, at the latest.I'm going to start next
week, and I'm really going EXPLORING, too--though not exactly as they
think.I came in to-day to make a business appointment for to-morrow,
please.A man starting on such a hazardous journey must be prepared,
you understand.I want to leave my affairs in such shape that you will
know exactly what to do--in emergency.The lawyer hesitated, his face an odd mixture of determination and
irresolution.To-morrow at ten--if
they don't shut you up before."Stanley G. Fulton leaped to his feet.At the door he turned back jauntily."And, say, Ned, what'll you bet I don't grow fat and young over this
thing?What'll you bet I don't get so I can eat real meat and 'taters
again?"JOHN SMITH


It was on the first warm evening in early June that Miss Flora
Blaisdell crossed the common and turned down the street that led to her
brother James's home.Its spacious green lawns and
elm-shaded walks were the pride of the town.There was a trellised
band-stand for summer concerts, and a tiny pond that accommodated a few
boats in summer and a limited number of skaters in winter.Perhaps,
most important of all, the common divided the plebeian East Side from
the more pretentious West.James Blaisdell lived on the West Side.His
wife said that everybody did who WAS anybody.They had lately moved
there, and were, indeed, barely settled.Her home was a shabby little rented
cottage on the East Side.She was a thin-faced little woman with an
anxious frown and near-sighted, peering eyes that seemed always to be
looking for wrinkles.She peered now at the houses as she passed slowly
down the street.She had been only twice to her brother's new home, and
she was not sure that she would recognize it, in spite of the fact that
the street was still alight with the last rays of the setting sun.Suddenly across her worried face flashed a relieved smile."Well, if you ain't all here out on the piazza!"she exclaimed,
turning, in at the walk leading up to one of the ornate little houses."Oh, yes, it's grand, all right," nodded the tired-looking man in the
big chair, removing his feet from the railing.He was in his
shirt-sleeves, and was smoking a pipe.The droop of his thin mustache
matched the droop of his thin shoulders--and both indefinably but
unmistakably spelled disillusion and discouragement."It's grand, but I
think it's too grand--for us.However, daughter says the best is none
too good--in Hillerton.Bessie, the pretty, sixteen-year-old daughter of the family, only
shrugged her shoulders a little petulantly.It was Harriet, the wife,
who spoke--a large, florid woman with a short upper lip, and a
bewilderment of bepuffed light hair.She was already on her feet,
pushing a chair toward her sister-in-law."Of course it isn't too grand, Jim, and you know it.There aren't any
really nice houses in Hillerton except the Pennocks' and the old
Gaylord place.The little
dressmaker began to fan herself with the hat she had taken off."My,
'tis fur over here, ain't it?Not much like 'twas when you lived right
'round the corner from me!And I had to put on a hat and gloves, too.Someway, I thought I ought to--over here."Condescendingly the bepuffed head threw an approving nod in her
direction.The East Side is different from the West Side, and
no mistake.And what will do there won't do here at all, of course.""How about father's shirt-sleeves?"It was a scornful gibe from Bessie
in the hammock."I don't notice any of the rest of the men around here
sitting out like that.""You know very well I'm not to
blame for what your father wears.I've tried hard enough, I'm sure!""Well, well, Hattie," sighed the man, with a gesture of abandonment."I
supposed I still had the rights of a freeborn American citizen in my
own home; but it seems I haven't."Resignedly he got to his feet and
went into the house.When he returned a moment later he was wearing his
coat.Benny, perched precariously on the veranda railing, gave a sudden
indignant snort.Benny was eight, the youngest of the family."Well, I don't think I like it here, anyhow," he chafed."I'd rather go
back an' live where we did.It hasn't
been anything but 'Here, Benny, you mustn't do that over here, you
mustn't do that over here!'I'm going home an' live
with Aunt Flora.Of course you can," beamed his aunt."But you won't
want to, I'm sure.Why, Benny, I think it's perfectly lovely here.""Indeed I do, Benny," corrected his father hastily."It's very nice
indeed here, of course.But I don't think we can afford it.We had to
squeeze every penny before, and how we're going to meet this rent I
don't know.""You'll earn it, just being here--more business," asserted his wife
firmly."Anyhow, we've just got to be here, Jim!We owe it to ourselves
and our family."He's over to Gussie Pennock's, playing tennis," interposed Bessie,
with a pout."The mean old thing wouldn't ask me!""But you ain't old enough, my dear," soothed her aunt."Wait; your turn
will come by and by.""Yes, that's exactly it," triumphed the mother."Her turn WILL come--if
we live here.Do you suppose Fred would have got an invitation to
Gussie Pennock's if we'd still been living on the East Side?Pennock's worth fifty thousand, if he's worth a
dollar!"But, Hattie, money isn't everything, dear," remonstrated her husband
gently."We had friends, and good friends, before.""Yes; but you wait and see what kind of friends we have now!""But we can't keep up with such people, dear, on our income; and--"

"Ma, here's a man.It was a husky whisper
from Benny.Bessie Blaisdell and the little
dressmaker cocked their heads interestedly.Blaisdell rose to her
feet and advanced toward the steps to meet the man coming up the walk.He was a tall, rather slender man, with a close-cropped, sandy beard,
and an air of diffidence and apology.As he took off his hat and came
nearer, it was seen that his eyes were blue and friendly, and that his
hair was reddish-brown, and rather scanty on top of his head.James Blaisdell," he murmured
hesitatingly.Something in the stranger's deferential manner sent a warm glow of
importance to the woman's heart.Blaisdell was suddenly reminded
that she was Mrs.James D. Blaisdell of the West Side.Blaisdell," she replied a bit pompously."What can we do for
you, my good man?"She had never
called a person "my good man" before.The man on the steps coughed slightly behind his hand--a sudden
spasmodic little cough.Then very gravely he reached into his pocket
and produced a letter.Robert Chalmers--a note to your husband," he bowed,
presenting the letter.A look of gratified surprise came into the woman's face.Her husband, already on his feet, whisked the sheet of paper from the
unsealed envelope, and adjusted his glasses.A moment later he held out
a cordial hand to the stranger.I'm glad to see any friend of Bob
Chalmers'.My wife and children, and my sister,
Miss Blaisdell.(Glancing at the
open note in his hand.)Chalmers, of the First
National."Still with that deference
so delightfully heart-warming, the newcomer bowed low to the ladies,
and made his way to the offered chair."I will explain at once my
business," he said then.It was an eager question from Benny on the veranda
railing."Pa isn't anything, but ma's a Congregationalist."protested a duet of feminine voices softly; but the
stranger, apparently ignoring the interruption, continued speaking."I am gathering material for a book on the Blaisdell family."James Blaisdell, with cordial
interest."It is my purpose to remain some time in your
town.I am told there are valuable records here, and an old
burying-ground of particular interest in this connection.The
neighboring towns, too, have much Blaisdell data, I understand.As I
said, I am intending to make this place my headquarters, and I am
looking for an attractive boarding-place.Chalmers was good enough
to refer me to you.""To us--for a BOARDING-place!"James D. Blaisdell's countenance as she said the words."Well, I'm sure
I don't see why he should."But, Hattie, we could," interposed her husband eagerly."There's that
big front room that we don't need a bit.And it would help a lot if--"
At the wrathful warning in his wife's eyes he fell back silenced."I said that we didn't keep boarders," reiterated the lady distinctly."Furthermore, we do need the room ourselves.""Yes, yes, of course; I understand," broke in Mr.Smith, as if in hasty
conciliation.Chalmers meant that perhaps one of you"--he
glanced uncertainly at the anxious-eyed little woman at his
left--"might--er--accommodate me.Perhaps you, now--" He turned his
eyes full upon Miss Flora Blaisdell, and waited.Why, I live all alone--that is, I mean, I couldn't,
you know," she stammered confusedly."I dressmake, and I don't get any
sort of meals--not fit for a man, I mean.Just women's things--tea,
toast, and riz biscuit.I'm so fond of riz biscuit!But, of course,
you--" She came to an expressive pause."Oh, I could stand the biscuit, so long as they're not health biscuit,"
laughed Mr."You see, I've been living on those and hot
water quite long enough as it is.""Oh, ain't your health good, sir?"The little dressmaker's face wore
the deepest concern."Well, it's better than it was, thank you.I think I can promise to be
a good boarder, all right.""Why don't you go to a hotel?"James D. Blaisdell still spoke with
a slightly injured air."Oh, indeed, that would not do at all--for my purpose," he murmured."I
wish to be very quiet.I fear I should find it quite disturbing--the
noise and confusion of a public place like that.Besides, for my work,
it seemed eminently fitting, as well as remarkably convenient, if I
could make my home with one of the Blaisdell family."With a sudden exclamation the little dressmaker sat erect."Say, Harriet, how funny we never thought!He's just the one for poor
Maggie!She lives--"

"Your SISTER!"Smith's face had come a look of startled
surprise--a look almost of terror."But there weren't but three--that
is, I thought--I understood from Mr.Chalmers that there were but three
Blaisdells, two brothers, and one sister--you, yourself.""Oh, poor Maggie ain't a Blaisdell," explained the little dressmaker,
with a smile."She's just Maggie Duff, father Duff's daughter by his
first wife, you know.He married our mother years ago, when we children
were little, so we were brought up with Maggie, and always called her
sister; though, of course, she really ain't any relation to us at all."He appeared to be settling something in his mind."She
isn't a Blaisdell, then.""No, but she's so near like one, and she's a splendid cook, and---"

"Well, I shan't send him to Maggie," cut in Mrs.James D. Blaisdell
with emphasis."Poor Maggie's got quite enough on her hands, as it is,
with that father of hers.Besides, she isn't a Blaisdell at all.""And she couldn't come and cook and take care of us near so much,
either, could she," plunged in Benny, "if she took this man ter feed?""That will do, Benny," admonished his mother, with nettled dignity."You forget that children should be seen and not heard."But, please, can't I be heard just a minute for this?Why don't
ye send the man ter Uncle Frank an' Aunt Jane?cried Miss Flora Blaisdell."I wouldn't wonder a mite
if they did.""Yes, I was thinking of them," nodded her sister-in-law."And they're
always glad of a little help,--especially Jane."Only the heightened color in his wife's cheeks showed that she had
heard--and understood."Here, Benny," she directed, "go and show the gentleman where Uncle
Frank lives."With a spring the boy leaped to the lawn and pranced to
the sidewalk, dancing there on his toes.Blaisdell," he said, "and you, ladies.I shall hope
to see you again soon.I am sure you can help me, if you will, in my
work.We shall be glad to see you," promised his
host."Come any time, and ask all the questions you want to.""And we shall be so interested," fluttered Miss Flora."I've always
wanted to know about father's folks.And are you a Blaisdell, too?"Smith coughed again twice behind
his hand."Er--ah--oh, yes, I may say that I am.Through my mother I am descended
from the original immigrant, Ebenezer Blaisdell."James Blaisdell spoke the word as if her tongue
were a pair of tongs that had picked up a noxious viper."Yes, but not exactly as we commonly regard the term nowadays," smiled
Mr.Ebenezer Blaisdell was a man of means and distinction.He was the founder of the family in this country.murmured the little dressmaker, as the visitor
descended the steps.John Smith to
the assembled group on the veranda."And now, young man, I'm at your
service," he smiled, as he joined Benny, still prancing on the sidewalk."Now he's what I call a real nice pleasant-spoken gentleman," avowed
Miss Flora, when she thought speech was safe."I do hope Jane'll take
him.""Oh, yes, he's well enough," condescended Mrs.Hattie Blaisdell, with a
yawn."Hattie, why wouldn't you take him in?""Just
think how the pay would help!And it wouldn't be a bit of work, hardly,
for you.Certainly it would be a lot easier than the way we are doing."Do you suppose I got over here on the West Side to
open a boarding-house?"Perhaps if you'd worry a little more, I wouldn't worry so much,"
sighed the man deeply."Well, mercy me, I must be going," interposed the little dressmaker,
springing to her feet with a nervous glance at her brother and his
wife."I'm forgetting it ain't so near as it used to be.Come again," called the three on the veranda.Then the door closed behind them, as they entered the house.Meanwhile, walking across the common, Benny was entertaining Mr."Yep, they'll take ye, I bet ye--Aunt Jane an' Uncle Frank will!""Well, that's good, I'm sure."Why, Aunt Jane'll just tumble over
herself ter get ye, if ye just mention first what yer'll PAY.She'll
begin ter reckon up right away then what she'll save.An' in a minute
she'll say, 'Yes, I'll take ye.'"Smith's voice was palpable even to
eight-year-old Benny."Oh, you don't need ter worry," he hastened to explain."She won't
starve ye; only she won't let ye waste anythin'.You'll have ter eat
all the crusts to yer pie, and finish 'taters before you can get any
puddin', an' all that, ye know.Ye see, she's great on savin'--Aunt
Jane is.She says waste is a sinful extravagance before the Lord.""But are you sure, my
boy, that you ought to talk--just like this, about your aunt?""Why, that's all right, Mr.Ev'rybody in town knows Aunt Jane.Why, Ma says folks say she'd save ter-day for ter-morrer, if she could.But she couldn't do that, could she?But you
wait till you see Aunt Jane.""Well, ye won't have ter wait long, Mr.She lives over the groc'ry store, ter save rent, ye know.An' here we are," he finished, banging open a door and
leading the way up a flight of ill-lighted stairs.CHAPTER III

THE SMALL BOY AT THE KEYHOLE


At the top of the stairs Benny tried to open the door, but as it did
not give at his pressure, he knocked lustily, and called "Aunt Jane,
Aunt Jane!"Smith, his finger almost on a small
push-button near him."Yep, but it don't go now.Uncle Frank wanted it fixed, but Aunt Jane
said no; knockin' was just as good, an' 'twas lots cheaper, 'cause
'twould save mendin', and didn't use any 'lectricity.But Uncle Frank
says---"

The door opened abruptly, and Benny interrupted himself to give eager
greeting.Smith saw a tall, angular woman with graying
dark hair and high cheek bones.Her eyes were keen and just now
somewhat sternly inquiring, as they were bent upon himself.Perceiving that Benny considered his mission as master of ceremonies at
an end, Mr."I came from your husband's brother, madam.He thought
perhaps you had a room that I could have."Her eyes grew still more coldly disapproving.He thought--that is, THEY thought that perhaps--you
would be so kind."I
never have--but that isn't saying I couldn't, of course.As she finished speaking she stepped to the low-burning gas
jet and turned it carefully to give a little more light down the narrow
hallway.Benny had already reached the door at the end of the hall.The woman
began to tug at her apron strings."I hope you'll excuse my gingham apron, Mr.--er--Smith.Well, as I was saying, I hope
you'll excuse this apron."Her fingers were fumbling with the knot at
the back."I take it off, mostly, when the bell rings, evenings or
afternoons; but I heard Benny, and I didn't suppose 't was anybody but
him.With a jerk she switched off the dark blue
apron, hung it over her arm, and smoothed down the spotless white apron
which had been beneath the blue.The next instant she hurried after
Benny with a warning cry.Oh, Benny, you're
always in such a hurry!"Benny, with a cheery "Come on!"had already banged open the door before
him, and was reaching for the gas burner.A moment later the feeble spark above had become a flaring sputter of
flame."There, child, what did I tell you?"Blaisdell
reduced the flaring light to a moderate flame, and motioned Mr.Before she seated herself, however, she went back into the
hall to lower the gas there.During her momentary absence the man, Smith, looked about him, and as
he looked he pulled at his collar.He felt suddenly a choking,
suffocating sensation.He still had the curious feeling of trying to
catch his breath when the woman came back and took the chair facing
him.In a moment he knew why he felt so suffocated--it was because that
nowhere could he see an object that was not wholly or partially covered
with some other object, or that was not serving as a cover itself.The floor bore innumerable small rugs, one before each chair, each
door, and the fireplace.The chairs themselves, and the sofa, were
covered with gray linen slips, which, in turn, were protected by
numerous squares of lace and worsted of generous size.The green silk
spread on the piano was nearly hidden beneath a linen cover, and the
table showed a succession of layers of silk, worsted, and linen, topped
by crocheted mats, on which rested several books with paper-enveloped
covers.The chandelier, mirror, and picture frames gleamed dully from
behind the mesh of pink mosquito netting.Even through the doorway into
the hall might be seen the long, red-bordered white linen path that
carried protection to the carpet beneath.(With a start the man pulled himself
together to listen to what the woman was saying.)"I think it's a
foolish extravagance, when kerosene is so good and so cheap; but my
husband will have it, and Mellicent, too, in spite of anything I
say--Mellicent's my daughter.I tell 'em if we were rich, it would be
different, of course.But this is neither here nor there, nor what you
came to talk about!Now just what is it that you want, sir?""I want to board here, if I may.""A year--two years, perhaps, if we are mutually satisfied."Before he could catch his breath to answer
Benny had jumped into the breach."He sounds something like a Congregationalist, only he ain't that, Aunt
Jane, and he ain't after money for missionaries, either."Jane Blaisdell smiled at Benny indulgently."You know, Benny, very well, that nothing would suit Aunt Jane better
than to give money to all the missionaries in the world, if she only
had it to give!""You're
working for some church, then, I take it.""I am a genealogist, madam, in a small way.I am collecting data for a
book on the Blaisdell family."The look of cold disapproval
came back to her eyes.WE couldn't take the book,
I'm sure."That would not be necessary, madam, I assure you," murmured Mr."But how do you get money to live on?I mean, how am I to know that
I'll get my pay?""Excuse me, but that kind of business
doesn't sound very good-paying; and, you see, I don't know you.And in
these days--" An expressive pause finished her sentence.I had a letter of
introduction to your brother from Mr.I think he will
vouch for me."Oh, that's all right, then.But that isn't saying how MUCH you'll pay.Now, I think--"

There came a sharp knock at the outer door.The eager Benny jumped to
his feet, but his aunt shook her head and went to the door herself.There was a murmur of voices, then a young man entered the hall and sat
down in the chair near the hatrack.Blaisdell returned her
eyes were very bright."If you'll just excuse me a minute," she apologized to Mr.Smith, as
she swept by him and opened a door across the room, nearly closing it
behind her.Distinctly then, from beyond the imperfectly closed door, came to the
ears of Benny and Mr.Blaisdell's most
excited accents:--"Mellicent, it's Carl Pennock.He wants you to go
auto-riding with him down to the Lake with Katie Moore and that crowd."Smith did not hear, for a nearer, yet more excited,
voice demanded attention.Won't my sister
Bess be mad?She thinks Carl Pennock's the cutest thing going.and an expressive glance toward the hall, Mr.Smith tried to stop further revelations; but Benny was not to be
silenced."They're rich--awful rich--the Pennocks are," he confided still more
huskily."An' there's a girl--Gussie.He's seventeen; an' Bess is mad 'cause she isn't
seventeen, too, so she can go an' play tennis same as Fred does.She'll
be madder 'n ever now, if Mell goes auto-riding with Carl, an'--"

"Sh-h!"Smith's voice and gesture this time that
Benny fell back subdued.At once then became distinctly audible again the voices from the other
room.Smith, forced to hear in spite of himself, had the air of one
who finds he has abandoned the frying pan for the fire."No, dear, it's quite out of the question," came from beyond the door,
in Mrs."I can't let you wear your pink.You will
wear the blue or stay at home."But, mother, dear, it's all out of date," wailed a young girl's voice.It's perfectly whole and neat, and you must save
the pink for best.""But I'm always saving things for best, mother, and I never wear my
best.I never wear a thing when it's in style!By the time you let me
wear the pink I shan't want to wear it.Sleeves'll be small then--you
see if they aren't--I shall be wearing big ones.I want to wear big
ones now, when other girls do."Mellicent, why will you tease me like this, when you know it will do
no good?--when you know I can't let you do it?Don't you think I want
you to be as well-dressed as anybody, if we could afford it?You must wear the blue or stay at home.There was a pause, then there came an inarticulate word and a choking
half-sob.The pink spots in her cheeks had deepened.She shut the door firmly,
then hurried through the room to the hall beyond.Another minute and
she was back in her chair."I'm ready now to talk business, Mr.She stated plainly what she expected to do for
her boarder, and what she expected her boarder would do for her.She
enlarged upon the advantages and minimized the discomforts, with the
aid of a word now and then from the eager and interested Benny.Smith, on his part, had little to say.That that little was most
satisfactory, however, was very evident; for Mrs.Blaisdell was soon
quite glowing with pride and pleasure.He
was plainly ill at ease, and, at times, slightly abstracted.His eyes
frequently sought the door which Mrs.Blaisdell had closed so firmly a
short time before.They were still turned in that direction when
suddenly the door opened and a young girl appeared.She was a slim little girl with long-lashed, starlike eyes and a
wild-rose flush in her cheeks.Beneath her trim hat her light brown
hair waved softly over her ears, glinting into gold where the light
struck it.She looked excited and pleased, yet not quite happy.She
wore a blue dress, plainly made.Be in before ten, dear," cautioned Mrs."And Mellicent, just a minute, dear.He's coming here to live--to board, you know.Smith, already on his feet, bowed and murmured a conventional
something.From the starlike eyes he received a fleeting glance that
made him suddenly conscious of his fifty years and the bald spot on the
top of his head.Then the girl was gone, and her mother was speaking
again."She's going auto-riding--Mellicent is--with a young man, Carl
Pennock--one of the nicest in town.They're going down to the Lake for cake and ice cream, and they're all
nice young people, else I shouldn't let her go, of course.She's
eighteen, for all she's so small.She favors my mother in looks, but
she's got the Blaisdell nose, though.Oh, and 'twas the Blaisdells you
said you were writing a book about, wasn't it?You don't mean OUR
Blaisdells, right here in Hillerton?""I mean all Blaisdells, wherever I find them," smiled Mr.Now that the matter
of board had been satisfactorily settled, Mrs.Blaisdell apparently
dared to show some interest in the book.My, how pleased Hattie'll be--my sister-in-law, Jim's
wife.She just loves to see her name in print--parties, and club
banquets, and where she pours, you know.But maybe you don't take
women, too.""Oh, yes, if they are Blaisdells, or have married Blaisdells."That's where we'd come in, then, isn't it?And
Frank, my husband, he'll like it, too,--if you tell about the grocery
store.And of course you would, if you told about him.You'd have
to--'cause that's all there is to tell.He thinks that's about all
there is in the world, anyway,--that grocery store.And 'tis a good
store, if I do say it.And there's his sister, Flora; and Maggie--But,
there!She won't be in it, will she, after all?She isn't
a Blaisdell, and she didn't marry one."She'll just laugh
and say it doesn't matter; and then Grandpa Duff'll ask for his drops
or his glasses, or something, and she'll forget all about it."Yes, I know; but--Poor Maggie!Blaisdell
sighed and looked thoughtful."But Maggie KNOWS a lot about the
Blaisdells," she added, brightening; "so she could tell you lots of
things--about when they were little, and all that."But--that isn't--er--" Mr."And, really, for that matter, she knows about us NOW, too, better than
'most anybody else.Hattie's always sending for her, and Flora, too, if
they're sick, or anything.Sometimes I think they actually
impose upon her.And she's such a good soul, too!I declare, I never
see her but I wish I could do something for her.But, of course, with
my means--But, there!Frank says I
never do know when to stop, when I get started on something; and of
course you didn't come here to talk about poor Maggie.When is it you want to start in--to board, I mean?""And now we must be going--Benny and I. I'm at the Holland House.Blaisdell, I'll send up my trunks to-morrow
morning.And now good-night--and thank you."The woman, too, came to her feet, but her face
was surprised."Why, you haven't even seen your room yet!How do you
know you'll like it?"There was a quizzical lift to his
eyebrows.Well--er--perhaps I will just take a look at--the room, though I'm not
worrying any, I assure you.I've no doubt it will be quite right, quite
right," he finished, as he followed Mrs.Blaisdell to a door halfway
down the narrow hall.Five minutes later, once more on the street, he was walking home with
Benny.It was Benny who broke the long silence that had immediately
fallen between them.Smith, I'll bet ye YOU'll never be rich!"I'll never be--What do you mean, boy?""'Cause you paid Aunt Jane what she asked the very first time.Why,
Aunt Jane never expects ter get what she asks, pa says.She sells him
groceries in the store, sometimes, when Uncle Frank's away, ye know.Pa
says what she asks first is for practice--just ter get her hand in; an'
she expects ter get beat down.But you paid it, right off the bat.Didn't ye see how tickled Aunt Jane was, after she'd got over bein'
surprised?""Why--er--really, Benny," murmured Mr."Oh, yes, sir, you could have saved a lot every week, if ye hadn't bit
so quick.An' that's why I say you won't ever get rich.Savin''s what
does it, ye know--gets folks rich.She says a penny
saved's good as two earned, an' better than four spent.""That does look as
if there wasn't much chance for me, doesn't it?"Benny spoke soberly, and with evident sympathy.He spoke
again, after a moment, but Mr.Smith was, indeed, not a little abstracted all the way to Benny's home,
though his good-night was very cheerful at parting.Benny would have
been surprised, indeed, had he known that Mr.Smith was thinking, not
about his foolishly extravagant agreement for board, but about a pair
of starry eyes with wistful lights in them, and a blue dress, plainly
made.John Smith wrote the following letter to
Edward D. Norton, Esq., Chicago:

MY DEAR NED,--Well, I'm here.I've been here exactly six hours, and
already I'm in possession of not a little Blaisdell data for
my--er--book.James, their daughter, Bessie, and
their son, Benny.Benny, by the way, is a gushing geyser of current
Blaisdell data which, I foresee, I shall find interesting, but
embarrassing, perhaps, at times.I've also seen Miss Flora, and Mrs.Jane Blaisdell and her daughter, Mellicent.There's a "Poor Maggie" whom I haven't seen.But she isn't a Blaisdell.She's a Duff, daughter of the man who married Rufus Blaisdell's widow,
some thirty years or more ago.As I said, I haven't seen her yet, but
she, too, according to Mrs.Frank Blaisdell, must be a gushing geyser
of Blaisdell data, so I probably soon shall see her.Why she's "poor" I
don't know.As for the Blaisdell data already in my possession--I've no comment to
make.Really, Ned, to tell the truth, I'm not sure I'm going to relish
this job, after all.In spite of a perfectly clear conscience, and the
virtuous realization that I'm here to bring nothing worse than a
hundred thousand dollars apiece with the possible addition of a few
millions on their devoted heads--in spite of all this, I yet have an
uncomfortable feeling that I'm a small boy listening at the keyhole.However, I'm committed to the thing now, so I'll stuff it out, I
suppose,--though I'm not sure, after all, that I wouldn't chuck the
whole thing if it wasn't that I wanted to see how Mellicent will enjoy
her pink dresses.How many pink dresses will a hundred thousand dollars
buy, anyway,--I mean PRETTY pink dresses, all fixed up with frills and
furbelows?As ever yours,

STAN--er--JOHN SMITH.CHAPTER IV

IN SEARCH OF SOME DATES


Very promptly the next morning Mr.John Smith and his two trunks
appeared at the door of his new boarding-place.Jane Blaisdell
welcomed him cordially.She wore a high-necked, long-sleeved gingham
apron this time, which she neither removed nor apologized for--unless
her cheerful "You see, mornings you'll find me in working trim, Mr.Mellicent, her slender young self enveloped in a similar apron, was
dusting his room as he entered it.She nodded absently, with a casual
"Good-morning, Mr.Even the
placing of the two big trunks, which the shuffling men brought in, won
from her only a listless glance or two.Then, without speaking again,
she left the room, as her mother entered it.Blaisdell looked about her complacently."With this
couch-bed with its red cover and cushions, and all the dressing things
moved to the little room in there, it looks like a real sitting-room in
here, doesn't it?""And you had 'em take the trunks in there, too.That's good," she
nodded, crossing to the door of the small dressing-room beyond.Well, I hope you'll be real happy with us, Mr.And you needn't be a mite afraid of
hurting anything.I've covered everything with mats and tidies and
spreads."A keen listener would have noticed an odd something in
Mr."Yes, I always do--to save wearing and soiling, you know.Of course, if
we had money to buy new all the time, it would be different.And that's what I tell Mellicent when she complains of so many
things to dust and brush.Dinner's at twelve o'clock, and supper is at six--except in the winter.We have it earlier then, so's we can go to bed earlier.I do like the long days, don't you?Well,
I'll be off now, and let you unpack.As I said before, make yourself
perfectly at home, perfectly at home."Smith drew a long breath and looked about him.It was a
pleasant room, in spite of its cluttered appearance.There was an
old-fashioned desk for his papers, and the chairs looked roomy and
comfortable.The little dressing-room carried many conveniences, and
the windows of both rooms looked out upon the green of the common."Oh, well, I don't know.This might be lots worse--in spite of the
tidies!"John Smith, as he singled out the keys of his
trunks.He was a
portly man with rather thick gray hair and "mutton-chop" gray whiskers.He ate very fast, and a great deal, yet he still found time to talk
interestedly with his new boarder.He was plainly a man of decided opinions--opinions which he did not
hesitate to express, and which he emphasized with resounding thumps of
his fists on the table.Smith, taken
utterly by surprise, was guilty of a visible start.After that he
learned to accept them with the serenity evinced by the rest of the
family.Smith knew (if he could remember them)
the current market prices of beans, corn, potatoes, sugar, and flour;
and he knew (again if he could remember) why some of these commodities
were higher, and some lower, than they had been the week before.That stocks and bonds fluctuated,
he was well aware.That "wheat" could be cornered, he realized.But of
the ups and downs of corn and beans as seen by the retail grocer he
knew very little.That is, he had known very little until after that
dinner with Mr.Smith began systematically to gather
material for his Blaisdell book.He would first visit by turns all the
Hillerton Blaisdells, he decided; then, when he had exhausted their
resources, he would, of course, turn to the town records and cemeteries
of Hillerton and the neighboring villages.Armed with a pencil and a very businesslike looking notebook,
therefore, he started at two o'clock for the home of James Blaisdell.Blaisdell's kind permission to come and ask all the
questions he liked, he deemed it fitting to begin there.He had no trouble in finding the house, but there was no one in sight
this time, as he ascended the steps.The house, indeed, seemed
strangely quiet.He was just about to ring the bell when around the
corner of the veranda came a hurried step and a warning voice."Oh, please, don't ring the bell!Isn't it something that I
can do for you?"He thought at first, from the trim, slender
figure, and the waving hair above the gracefully poised head, that he
was confronting a young woman.Then he saw the silver threads at the
temples, and the fine lines about the eyes.James Blaisdell," he answered,
lifting his hat.She smiled brightly, then
went on before he could reply.I fancy I should be edified to hear
it--that description."Then, a bit roguishly, she demanded:--"Should you
like to hear it--really?"I've already collected a few samples of Benny's
descriptive powers."She motioned him
to a chair, and dropped easily into one herself."Benny said you were
tall and not fat; that you had a wreath of light hair 'round a bald
spot, and whiskers that were clipped as even as Mr.Pennock's hedge;
and that your lips, without speaking, said, 'Run away, little boy,' but
that your eyes said, 'Come here.'"So I judge, since you recognized me without any difficulty," rejoined
Mr.You see you have the advantage of
me."Oh, I'm just here to help out.Blaisdell is ill upstairs--one of
her headaches.That is why I asked you not to ring.She gets so nervous
when the bell rings.She thinks it's callers, and that she won't be
ready to receive them; and she hurries up and begins to dress.So I
asked you not to ring.""Oh, for the book, of course.Oh, yes, I have heard about that, too."Blaisdell will soon
be here.He's coming early so I can go home."And you are--"

"Miss Duff."You don't mean--'Poor Maggie'!"(Not until the words were out did Mr."Er--ah--that is--" He
stumbled miserably, and she came to his rescue."Oh, yes, I'm--'Poor Maggie.'"There was an odd something in her
expressive face that Mr.He was groping for
something--anything to say, when suddenly there was a sound behind
them, and the little woman at his side sprang to her feet."Oh, Hattie, you came down!"James Blaisdell
opened the screen door and stepped out on to the veranda.Blaisdell advanced and held out her hand.She looked pale, and her hair
hung a bit untidily about one ear below a somewhat twisted pyramid of
puffs.Her dress, though manifestly an expensive one, showed haste in
its fastenings."Yes, I heard voices, and I thought some one had
come--a caller."I'm glad--if you're better," smiled Miss Maggie."Then I'll go, if you
don't mind.Smith has come to ask you some questions, Hattie.With another cheery smile and a nod to Mr.Smith, she
disappeared into the house.Smith saw her hurrying
down a side path to the street.Blaisdell sank languidly into
a chair."About the Blaisdell family--yes.But perhaps another day, when you are
feeling better, Mrs."I can answer to-day as
well as any time--though I'm not sure I can tell you very much, ever.I
think it's fine you are making the book, though.Some way it gives a
family such a standing, to be written up like that.And the Blaisdells are really a very nice family--one of the oldest in
Hillerton, though, of course, they haven't much money.""I ought to find a good deal of material here, then, if they have lived
here so long."Of course I can tell you
about my own family.You
knew that, didn't you?His
picture was in it a year ago last June.There was a write-up on
Hillerton.I was in it, too, though there wasn't much about me.But
I've got other clippings with more, if you'd like to see them--where
I've poured, and been hostess, and all that, you know."Blaisdell, your husband's father's name was Rufus, I
believe.What was his mother's maiden name, please?"Our little girl is named
for her--Bessie, you know--you saw her last night.Jim wanted to, so I
let him.It's a pretty name--Elizabeth--still, it sounds a little
old-fashioned now, don't you think?Of course we are anxious to have
everything just right for our daughter.A young lady soon coming out,
so,--you can't be too particular.That's one reason why I wanted to get
over here--on the West Side, I mean.Everybody who is anybody lives on
the West Side in Hillerton.And your mother Blaisdell's surname?"Smith's
pencil was poised over the open notebook.But,
dear me, I don't know.I suppose Jim will, or Flora, or maybe
Frank--though I don't believe HE will, unless her folks kept groceries.Did you ever see anybody that didn't know anything but groceries like
Frank Blaisdell?"The lady sighed and shrugged her somewhat heavy
shoulders with an expressive glance."Oh, well, it's good--to be interested in one's business, you know."murmured the lady, with another shrug.Rufus Blaisdell's surname?"But Jim--Oh, I'll tell you who will know," she broke off
interestedly; "and that's Maggie Duff.You saw her here a few minutes
ago, you know.Father Duff's got all of Mother Blaisdell's papers and
diaries.Oh, Maggie can tell you a lot of things.Benny
says if we want ANYTHING we ask Aunt Maggie, and I don't know but he's
right.And here I am, sending you to her, so soon!""I don't see but what I shall have
to interview Miss Maggie, and Miss Flora.Is there nothing more, then,
that you can tell me?""Well, there's Fred, my son.He's at the head of his class, and he's going to college and
be a lawyer.And that's another reason why I wanted to come over to
this side--on Fred's account.I want him to meet the right sort of
people.We think we're going to have Fred a
big man some day."Smith's pencil still poised above an
almost entirely blank page.He'll be eighteen the tenth of next month.""And Miss Bessie, and Benny?"She wants to come
out then, but I think I shall wait--a little, she's so very young;
though Gussie Pennock's out, and she's only seventeen, and the Pennocks
are some of our very best people.They're the richest folks in town,
you know.""He's eight--or rather nine, next Tuesday.Smith, don't
you want ANYTHING but dates?They're tiresome things, I think,--make
one feel so old, you know, and it shows up how many years you've been
married.Well, you miss a lot, of course,--home and wife and
children.You aren't tied down, and you
don't have so much to worry about.Is your mother living, or your
father?"Smith stirred a little uneasily,
and adjusted his book.Blaisdell, you can give me
your own maiden name.""Oh, yes, I can give you that!"She laughed and bridled
self-consciously."But you needn't ask when I was born, for I shan't
tell you, if you do.And the Snows were just as good as the Blaisdells,
if I do say it.There were a lot that wanted me--oh, I was pretty THEN,
Mr.She laughed, and bridled again self-consciously.He was handsome then, very--big dark eyes and dark hair, and
so dreamy and poetical-looking; and there wasn't a girl that hadn't set
her cap for him.And he's been a good husband to me.To be sure, he
isn't quite so ambitious as he might be, perhaps._I_ always did
believe in being somebody, and getting somewhere.But
Jim--he's always for hanging back and saying how much it'll cost.Ten
to one he doesn't end up by saying we can't afford it.He's like
Jane,--Frank's wife, where you board, you know,--only Jane's worse than
Jim ever thought of being.She won't spend even what she's got.If
she's got ten dollars, she won't spend but five cents, if she can help
it.Now, I believe in taking some comfort as you go along.But
Jane--greatest saver I ever did see.Smith, that
she doesn't try to save feeding you at all!"Smith smiled cheerily, snapped his book shut
and got to his feet."Oh, won't you wait for Mr.He can tell you more, I'm sure."At his office, some time, I'll see Mr."But I thank you
very much, Mrs.Blaisdell," he bowed in farewell.CHAPTER V

IN MISS FLORA'S ALBUM


It was the next afternoon that Mr.Smith inquired his way to the home
of Miss Flora Blaisdell.He found it to be a shabby little cottage on a
side street.Miss Flora herself answered his knock, peering at him
anxiously with her near-sighted eyes."Good-afternoon, Miss Blaisdell," he began with a deferential bow."I
am wondering if you could tell me something of your father's family."Miss Flora, plainly pleased, but flustered, stepped back for him to
enter.I'm sure I'm glad to tell you
anything I know," she beamed, ushering him into the unmistakably
little-used "front room.""But you really ought to go to Maggie.I can
tell you some things, but Maggie's got the Bible.Mother had it, you
know, and it's all among her things.And of course we had to let it
stay, as long as Father Duff lives.Poor Maggie--she tried to get 'em for us; but, mercy!I've got pictures of a lot of them,
and most of them I know quite a lot about."As she spoke she nicked up from the table a big red plush photograph
album.Seating herself at his side she opened it, and began to tell him
of the pictures, one by one.She did, indeed, know "quite a lot" of most of them.Tintypes,
portraying stiffly held hands and staring eyes, ghostly reproductions
of daguerreotypes of stern-lipped men and women, in old-time stock and
kerchief; photographs of stilted family groups after the
"he-is-mine-and-I-am-his" variety; snap-shots of adorable babies with
blurred thumbs and noses--never had Mr.Busily, from time to time, he jotted down a name
or date.Then, suddenly, as she turned a page, he gave an involuntary
start.He was looking at a pictured face, evidently cut from a magazine."Why, what--who--" he stammered.Miss Flora's
hands fluttered over the page a little importantly, adjusting a corner
of the print.I can't tell you just how, only I know he
is.That's why I've always been so
interested in him, and read everything I could--in the papers and
magazines, you know."John Smith's voice had become a little uncertain.Miss Flora's eyes were musingly
fixed on the picture before her--which was well, perhaps: Mr.John
Smith's face was a study just then."Er--n-no, he isn't.""But he's turribly rich, I s'pose.I wonder how it feels to have so
much money."There being no reply to this, Miss Flora went on after a moment."It must be awful nice--to buy what you want, I mean, without fretting
about how much it costs."What would you do--if you could--if you had the money, I mean?""Well, there's three things I know I'd do.They're silly, of course,
but they're what I WANT.It's a phonygraph, and to see Niagara Falls,
and to go into Noell's restaurant and order what I want without even
looking at the prices after 'em."What's more, I hope you'll get them--some time."Why, if I had the money, I shouldn't
spend it--not for them things.I'd be needing shoes or a new dress.And
I COULDN'T be so rich I wouldn't notice what the prices was--of what I
ate.But, then, I don't believe anybody's that, not even him."She
pointed to the picture still open before them.Smith, his eyes bent upon the picture, was looking
thoughtful.He had the air of a man to whom has come a brand-new,
somewhat disconcerting idea.Miss Flora, glancing from the man to the picture, and back again, gave
a sudden exclamation."There, now I know who it is that you remind me of, Mr.Miss Flora was still interestedly
comparing the man and the picture, "But, then, that ain't so strange.Didn't you say you was a Blaisdell?""Er--y-yes, oh, yes.I'm a Blaisdell," nodded Mr."Very
likely I've got the--er--Blaisdell nose.Then he turned a leaf of
the album abruptly, decidedly.he demanded,
pointing to the tintype of a bright-faced young girl.Oh, that's my cousin Grace when she was sixteen.She died; but
she was a wonderful girl.Smith; and even the closest observer, watching his
face, could not have said that he was not absorbedly interested in Miss
Flora's story of "my cousin Grace."It was not until the last leaf of the album was reached that they came
upon the picture of a small girl, with big, hungry eyes looking out
from beneath long lashes."That's Mellicent--where you're boarding, you know--when she was
little.""But it's horrid, poor
child!""But she looks so--so sad," murmured Mr.She
hesitated, then burst out, as if irresistibly impelled from within."It's only just another case of never having what you want WHEN you
want it, Mr.And it ain't 'cause they're poor, either.They
AIN'T poor--not like me, I mean.Frank's always done well, and he's
been a good provider; but it's my sister-in-law--her way, I mean.Not
that I'm saying anything against Jane.She's a good woman, and
she's very kind to me.She's always saying what she'd do for me if she
only had the money.She's a good housekeeper, too, and her house is as
neat as wax.But it's just that she never thinks she can USE anything
she's got till it's so out of date she don't want it.I dressmake for
her, you see, so I know--about her sleeves and skirts, you know.And if
she ever does wear a decent thing she's so afraid it will rain she
never takes any comfort in it!""Well, that is--unfortunate."And she's brought up that poor child the same way.Why,
from babyhood, Mellicent never had her rattles till she wanted blocks,
nor her blocks till she wanted dolls, nor her dolls till she was big
enough for beaus!And that's what made the poor child always look so
wall-eyed and hungry.She was hungry--even if she did get enough to
eat."Blaisdell probably believed in--er--economy," hazarded Mr.But, there, I ought not to
have said anything, of course.I only wish some
other folks I could mention had more of it.There's Jim's wife, for
instance.Now, if she's got ten cents, she'll spend fifteen--and five
more to show HOW she spent it.She and Jane ought to be shaken up in a
bag together.Smith, Jane doesn't let herself enjoy anything.She's always keeping it for a better time.Though sometimes I think she
DOES enjoy just seeing how far she can make a dollar go.But Mellicent
don't, nor Frank; and it's hard on them."Smith was looking at the wistful eyes
under the long lashes."'T is; and 't ain't right, I believe.There IS such a thing as being
too economical.I tell Jane she'll be like a story I read once about a
man who pinched and saved all his life, not even buying peanuts, though
he just doted on 'em.And when he did get rich, so he could buy the
peanuts, he bought a big bag the first thing.He
hadn't got any teeth left to chew 'em with."Smith, as he pocketed his
notebook and rose to his feet."And now I thank you very much, Miss
Blaisdell, for the help you've been to me.""Oh, you're quite welcome, indeed you are, Mr.Smith," beamed Miss
Blaisdell."It's done me good, just to talk to you about all these
folks and pictures.I do get lonesome sometimes, all
alone, so!and I ain't so busy as I wish I was, always.But I'm afraid
I haven't helped you much--just this.""Oh, yes, you have--perhaps more than think," smiled the man, with an
odd look in his eyes.Well, I'm glad, I'm sure.And don't forget to go to Maggie's,
now.And she'll be so glad
to show you!""All right, thank you; I'll surely interview--Miss Maggie," smiled the
man in good-bye.He had almost said "poor" Maggie himself, though why she should be POOR
Maggie had come to be an all-absorbing question with him.He had been
tempted once to ask Miss Flora, but something had held him back.That
evening at the supper table, however, in talking with Mrs.Jane
Blaisdell, the question came again to his lips; and this time it found
utterance.Jane herself had introduced Miss Maggie's name, and had said an
inconsequential something about her when Mr.Blaisdell, please,--may I ask?I must confess to a great
curiosity as to why Miss Duff is always 'poor Maggie.'""Why, really, I don't know," she answered, "only it just comes natural,
that's all.I did it again,
didn't I?That only goes to show how we all do it, unconsciously."Frank Blaisdell, across the table, gave a sudden emphatic sniff.Well, I guess if you had to live with Father Duff, Jane, it
would be 'poor Jane' with you, all right!""Father Duff's a trial, and no mistake.Aunt Maggie's a saint--that's what she is!"It was Mellicent who
spoke, her young voice vibrant with suppressed feeling."She's the
dearest thing ever!There COULDN'T be anybody better than Aunt Maggie!"Nothing more was said just then, but in the evening, later, after
Mellicent had gone to walk with young Pennock, and her father had gone
back down to the store, Mrs.Blaisdell took up the matter of "Poor
Maggie" again."I've been thinking what you said," she began, "about our calling her
'poor Maggie,' and I've made up my mind it's because we're all so sorry
for her.You see, she's been so unfortunate, as I said.I've so often wished there was something I could do for her.Of course,
if we only had money--but we haven't; so I can't.And even money
wouldn't take away her father, either.I didn't mean that,
really,--not the way it sounded," broke off Mrs.Blaisdell, in shocked
apology."I only meant that she'd have her father to care for, just the
same.""He's something of a trial, I take it, eh?"How ever she endures it, I
can't imagine.Of course, we call him Father Duff, but he's really not
any relation to us--I mean to Frank and the rest.But their mother
married him when they were children, and they never knew their own
father much, so he's the father they know.When their mother died,
Maggie had just entered college.She was eighteen, and such a pretty
girl!"Well, of course Maggie had to come home right away.None of the rest
wanted to take care of him and Maggie had to.There was another Duff
sister then--a married sister (she's died since), but SHE wouldn't take
him, so Maggie had to.Of course, none of the Blaisdells wanted the
care of him--and he wasn't their father, anyway.Frank was wanting to
marry me, and Jim and Flora were in school and wanted to stay there, of
course.She was so
ambitious, and so fond of books.But she came, and went right into the
home and kept it so Frank and Jim and Flora could live there just the
same as when their mother was alive.And she had to do all the work,
too.Kind of hard, wasn't it?--and
Maggie only eighteen!"Smith's lips came together a bit grimly."Well, after a time Frank and Jim married, and there was only Flora and
Father Duff at home.Poor Maggie tried then to go to college again.She
was over twenty-one, and supposed to be her own mistress, of course.She found a place where she could work and pay her way through college,
and Flora said she'd keep the house and take care of Father Duff.But,
dear me; it wasn't a month before that ended, and Maggie had to come
home again.Flora wasn't strong, and the work fretted her.Besides, she
never could get along with Father Duff, and she was trying to learn
dressmaking, too.She stuck it out till she got sick, though, then of
course Maggie had to come back."She
persuaded her father to get a girl.The
first girl and her father fought like cats and dogs, and the last time
she got one her father was taken sick, and again she had to come home.Some way, it's always been that way with poor Maggie.No sooner does
she reach out to take something than it's snatched away, just as she
thinks she's got it.Why, there was her father's cousin George--he was
going to help her once.But a streak of bad luck hit him at just that
minute, and he gave out."He's done
well, too, they say, and I always thought he'd send back something; but
he never has.There was some trouble, I believe, between him and Father
Duff at the time he went to Alaska, so that explains it, probably.Anyway, he's never done anything for them.Well, when he gave out,
Maggie just gave up college then, and settled down to take care of her
father, though I guess she's always studied some at home; and I know
that for years she didn't give up hope but that she could go some time."Why, let me see--forty-three, forty-four--yes, she's forty-five.She
had her forty-third birthday here--I remember I gave her a handkerchief
for a birthday present--when she was helping me take care of Mellicent
through the pneumonia; and that was two years ago.She used to come
here and to Jim's and Flora's days at a time; but she isn't quite so
free as she was--Father Duff's worse now, and she don't like to leave
him nights, much, so she can't come to us so often."And
just what is the matter with Mr.Jane Blaisdell gave a short laugh and shrugged her
shoulders."Everything's the matter--with Father Duff!Oh, it's nerves,
mostly, the doctor says, and there are some other things--long names
that I can't remember.But, as I said, everything's the matter with
Father Duff.He's one of those men where there isn't anything quite
right.Frank says he's got so he just objects to everything--on general
principles.If it's blue, he says it ought to be black, you know.And,
really, I don't know but Frank's right.How Maggie stands him I don't
see; but she's devotion itself.Why, she even gave up her lover years
ago, for him.She wouldn't leave her father, and, of course, nobody
would think of taking HIM into the family, when he wasn't BORN into it,
so the affair was broken off.I don't know, really, as Maggie cared
much.She never was one to carry her heart on
her sleeve.I've always so wished I could do something for
her!But, then, you asked, and you're interested,
I know, and that's what you're here for--to find out about the
Blaisdells.""To--to--f-find out--" stammered Mr."Yes, for your book, I mean.""Oh, yes--of course; for my book," agreed Mr.He
had the guilty air of a small boy who has almost been caught in a raid
on the cooky jar."And although poor Maggie isn't really a Blaisdell herself, she's
nearly one; and they've got lots of Blaisdell records down there--among
Mother Blaisdell's things, you know.I'll want to see those, of course," declared Mr.Smith, rising to his feet, preparatory to going to his own room.CHAPTER VI

POOR MAGGIE


It was some days later that Mr.Smith asked Benny one afternoon to show
him the way to Miss Maggie Duff's home."Sure I will," agreed Benny with alacrity."You don't ever have ter do
any teasin' ter get me ter go ter Aunt Maggie's.""You're fond of Aunt Maggie, then, I take it."Why, I don't know
anybody that don't like Aunt Maggie.""I'm sure that speaks well--for Aunt Maggie," smiled Mr.A feller can take some comfort at Aunt Maggie's," continued
Benny, trudging along at Mr."She don't have anythin'
just for show, that you can't touch, like 'tis at my house, and there
ain't anythin' but what you can use without gettin' snarled up in a
mess of covers an' tidies, like 'tis at Aunt Jane's.But Aunt Maggie
don't save anythin', Aunt Jane says, an' she'll die some day in the
poor-house, bein' so extravagant."Well, really, Benny, I--er--" hesitated the man."Well, I don't believe she will," repeated Benny."I hope she won't,
anyhow.Poorhouses ain't very nice, are they?""I--I don't think I know very much about them, Benny.""Well, I don't believe they are, from what Aunt Jane says.And if they
ain't, I don't want Aunt Maggie ter go.She hadn't ought ter have
anythin'--but Heaven--after Grandpa Duff.He's got a chronic grouch, ma says.It means it keeps goin' without stoppin'--the rheumatism, I
mean, not the folks that's got it.THEY don't go at all, sometimes.Cole don't, and that's what he's got.But when I asked ma what a
grouch was, she said little boys should be seen and not heard.Ma
always says that when she don't want to answer my questions."Oh, are you POOR, too?"Well, that is, I--I--"

"Ma was wonderin' yesterday what you lived on.Haven't you got any
money, Mr."Oh, yes, Benny, I've got money enough--to live on."Smith spoke
promptly, and with confidence this time.You're glad, then, ain't you?Ma says we haven't--got
enough ter live on, I mean; but pa says we have, if we didn't try ter
live like everybody else lives what's got more."Smith bit his lip, and looked down a little apprehensively at the
small boy at his side."I--I'm not sure, Benny, but _I_ shall have to say little boys should
be seen and not--" He stopped abruptly.Benny, with a stentorian shout,
had run ahead to a gate before a small white cottage.On the cozy,
vine-shaded porch sat a white-haired old man leaning forward on his
cane."Hi, there, Grandpa Duff, I've brought somebody ter see ye!"The gate
was open now, and Benny was halfway up the short walk.Smith doffed his hat and came forward.The man on the porch looked up sharply from beneath heavy brows.Smith, on the topmost step, hesitated."Is
your--er--daughter in, Mr.His somewhat unfriendly gaze was still bent
upon the newcomer."Just what do you want of my daughter?""Why, I--I--" Plainly nonplused, the man paused uncertainly.Then, with
a resumption of his jaunty cheerfulness, he smiled straight into the
unfriendly eyes.Duff,--records of the
Blaisdell family.I'm compiling a book on--

"Humph!Duff curtly, settling back
in his chair."As I said, I've heard of you.But you needn't come here
asking your silly questions.I shan't tell you a thing, anyway, if you
do.It's none of your business who lived and died and what they did
before you were born.If the Lord had wanted you to know he'd 'a' put
you here then instead of now!"Looking very much as if he had received a blow in the face, Mr."Aw, grandpa"--began Benny, in grieved expostulation.But a cheery
voice interrupted, and Mr.Smith turned to see Miss Maggie Duff
emerging from the doorway.she greeted him, extending a cordial
hand.For only the briefest of minutes he hesitated.Could she
have heard, and yet speak so unconcernedly?And
yet--He took the chair she offered--but with a furtive glance toward
the old man.Smith tells me he has come to see those records.Now, I'm--"

"Oh, father, dear, you couldn't!"interrupted his daughter with
admonishing earnestness."You mustn't go and get all those down!"Smith almost gasped aloud in his amazement, but Miss Maggie did not
seem to notice him at all.)"Why, father, you couldn't--they're too
heavy for you!There are the Bible, and all those papers.Besides, I shouldn't think you'd want
to get them!"Smith, hearing this, almost gasped aloud in his amazement, he
quite did so at what happened next.His mouth actually fell open as he
saw the old man rise to his feet with stern dignity.I'm not quite in my dotage yet.I guess I'm
still able to fetch downstairs a book and a bundle of papers."With his
thumping cane a resolute emphasis to every other step, the old man
hobbled into the house."There, grandpa, that's the talk!""But you said--"

"Er--Benny, dear," interposed Miss Maggie, in a haste so precipitate
that it looked almost like alarm, "run into the pantry and see what you
can find in the cooky jar."The last of her sentence was addressed to
Benny's flying heels as they disappeared through the doorway.Smith searched the woman's face for some hint, some
sign that this extraordinary shift-about was recognized and understood;
but Miss Maggie, with a countenance serenely expressing only cheerful
interest, was over by the little stand, rearranging the pile of books
and newspapers on it."I think, after all," she began thoughtfully, pausing in her work,
"that it will be better indoors.It blows so out here that you'll be
bothered in your copying, I am afraid."She was still standing at the table, chatting about the papers,
however, when at the door, a few minutes later, appeared her father, in
his arms a big Bible, and a sizable pasteboard box."Right here, father, please," she said then, to Mr.The old man frowned and cast disapproving eyes on his daughter and the
table.I don't want them there," he observed coldly.With the words he turned back into the house.Smith's bewildered eyes searched Miss Maggie's face and
once again they found nothing but serene unconcern."This way, please," she directed cheerily.And, still marveling, he
followed her into the house.Smith thought he had never seen so charming a living-room.A
comfortable chair invited him, and he sat down.He felt suddenly rested
and at home, and at peace with the world.Realizing that, in some way,
the room had produced this effect, he looked curiously about him,
trying to solve the secret of it.Reluctantly to himself he confessed that it was a very ordinary room.The carpet was poor, and was badly worn.The chairs, while comfortable
looking, were manifestly not expensive, and had seen long service.Simple curtains were at the windows, and a few fair prints were on the
walls.Two or three vases, of good lines but cheap materials, held
flowers, and there was a plain but roomy set of shelves filled with
books--not immaculate, leather-backed, gilt-lettered "sets" but rows of
dingy, worn volumes, whose very shabbiness was at once an invitation
and a promise.Smith see protecting cover
mat, or tidy.He decided then that this must be why he felt suddenly so
rested and at peace with all mankind.Even as the conviction came to
him, however he was suddenly aware that everything was not, after all,
peaceful or harmonious.Duff and his daughter were arranging the Bible and the
papers.Miss Maggie suggested piles in a certain order: her father
promptly objected, and arranged them otherwise.Miss Maggie placed the
papers first for perusal: her father said "Absurd!"Miss Maggie started to draw up a chair to the table: her father
derisively asked her if she expected a man to sit in that--and drew up
a different one.Smith, when he was finally invited to take a
seat at the table, found everything quite the most convenient and
comfortable possible.Once more into Miss Maggie's face he sent a sharply inquiring glance,
and once more he encountered nothing but unruffled cheerfulness.With a really genuine interest in the records before him, Mr.The Bible had been in the Blaisdell family for
generations, and it was full of valuable names and dates.Duff, on the other side of the table, was arranging into piles the
papers before him.He complained of the draft, and Miss Maggie shut the
window.He said then that he didn't mean he wanted to suffocate, and
she opened the one on the other side.The clock had hardly struck three
when he accused her of having forgotten his medicine.Yet when she
brought it he refused to take it.She had not brought the right kind of
spoon, he said, and she knew perfectly well he never took it out of
that narrow-bowl kind.He complained of the light, and she lowered the
curtain; but he told her that he didn't mean he didn't want to see at
all, so she put it up halfway.He said his coat was too warm, and she
brought another one.He put it on grudgingly, but he declared that it
was as much too thin as the other was too thick.Smith, in spite of his efforts to be politely deaf and blind, found
himself unable to confine his attention to birth, death, and marriage
notices.Once he almost uttered an explosive "Good Heavens, how do you
stand it?"But he stopped himself just in time, and
fiercely wrote with a very black mark that Submit Blaisdell was born in
eighteen hundred and one.Duff's attention was frowningly turned across the table toward himself."If you will spend your time over such silly stuff, why don't you use a
bigger book?""Because it wouldn't fit my pocket," smiled Mr."Just what business of yours is it, anyhow, when these people lived and
died?""Why don't you let them alone, then?"Why, I--I--" Mr."Well, I can tell you it's a silly business, whatever you find.If you
find your grandfather's a bigger man than you are, you'll be proud of
it, but you ought to be ashamed of it--'cause you aren't bigger
yourself!On the other hand, if you find he ISN'T as big as you are,
you'll be ashamed of that, when you ought to be proud of it--'cause
you've gone him one better.But can't you do any work, real work?""He is doing work, real work, now, father," interposed Miss Maggie
quickly."He's having a woeful time, too.If you'd only help him, now,
and show him those papers.""Well, I shan't," he observed tartly."I'M not a fool, if he is.I'm
going out to the porch where I can get some air.""There, work as long as you like, Mr.I knew you'd rather work
by yourself," nodded Miss Maggie, moving the piles of papers nearer him."But, good Heavens, how do you stand--" exploded Mr.Smith before he
realized that this time he had really said the words aloud."After all, it
doesn't matter.You couldn't help
seeing--how things were, of course, and I forgot, for a moment, that
you were a stranger.You see,
father is nervous, and not at all well."But do you mean that you always have to tell him to do what you don't
want, in order to--well--that is--" Mr.Smith, finding himself in very
deep water, blushed again painfully.Miss Maggie met his dismayed gaze with cheerful candor."Tell him to do what I DON'T want in order to get him to do what I do
want him to?But I don't mind; really I don't.And when you know how, what does it matter?To most of the world we say, 'Please do,' when we
want a thing, while to him we have to say, 'Please don't.'You see, it's really very simple--when you know how."He wanted to say more; but
Miss Maggie, with a smiling nod, turned away, so he went back to his
work.Benny, wandering in from the kitchen, with both hands full of cookies,
plumped himself down on the cushioned window-seat, and drew a sigh of
content.The blithe voice and pleasant smile took all the sting
from the prompt refusal.Maybe pa would--a little; but Bess and ma wouldn't.Miss Maggie crossed to a little stand and picked up
a small box.Benny shifted his now depleted stock of cookies to one hand, dropped to
his knees on the floor, and dumped the contents of the box upon the
seat before him."They won't let me eat cookies any more at home--in the house, I mean."But you know you have to pick up your crumbs here, dear."But I don't mind--after I've had the fun of eatin' first.But
they won't let me drop 'em ter begin with, there, nor take any of the
boys inter the house.Honest, Aunt Maggie, there ain't anything a
feller can do,'seems so, if ye live on the West Side," he persisted
soberly.Smith, copying dates at the table, was conscious of a slightly
apprehensive glance in his direction from Miss Maggie's eyes, as she
murmured:--

"But you're forgetting your puzzle, Benny."I can't do puzzles there, either.""All the more reason, then, why you should like to do them here.See,
where does this dog's head go?"Listlessly Benny took the bit of pictured wood in his fingers and began
to fit it into the pattern before him."I used ter do 'em an' leave 'em 'round, but ma says I can't now.Callers might come and find 'em, an' what would they say--on the West
Side!An' that's the way 'tis with everything.Ma an' Bess are always
doin' things, or not doin' 'em, for those callers."Yes, yes, dear, but they will, when they get acquainted.You haven't
found where the dog's head goes yet.""Pa says he don't want ter get acquainted.He'd rather have the old
friends, what don't mind baked beans, an' shirt-sleeves, an' doin' yer
own work, an' what thinks more of yer heart than they do of yer
pocketbook.An' say, we have ter wash our
hands every meal now--on the table, I mean--in those little glass
wash-dishes.Ma went down an' bought some, an' she's usin' 'em every
day, so's ter get used to 'em.She says everybody that is anybody has
'em nowadays.Bess thinks they're great, but I don't.I don't like 'em
a mite."It doesn't matter--it doesn't really matter,
does it, if you do have to use the little dishes?Come, you're not half
doing the puzzle."Benny shifted his position, and picked up a three-cornered
bit of wood carrying the picture of a dog's paw.You see, things are so different--on the West Side.Miss Maggie turned from the puzzle with a start.It's keepin' books for a man.It brings in
quite a lot extry, ma says; but she wouldn't let me have some new
roller skates when mine broke.She's savin' up for a chafin' dish.You eat out of it, some way--I
mean, it cooks things ter eat; an' Bess wants one.ALL our eatin's different,'seems so, on the West Side.Ma has
dinners nights now, instead of noons.She says the Pennocks do, an'
everybody does who is anybody.Pa don't, either,
an' half the time he can't get home in time for it, anyhow, on account
of gettin' back to his new job, ye know, an'--"

"Oh, I've found where the dog's head goes," cried Miss Maggie, There
was a hint of desperation in her voice."I shall have your puzzle all
done for you myself, if you don't look out, Benny.I don't believe you
can do it, anyhow."retorted Benny, with sudden
spirit, falling to work in earnest."I never saw a puzzle yet I
couldn't do!"Smith, bending assiduously over his work at the table, heard Miss
Maggie's sigh of relief--and echoed it, from sympathy.CHAPTER VII

POOR MAGGIE AND SOME OTHERS


It was half an hour later, when Mr.Smith and Benny were walking across
the common together, that Benny asked an abrupt question."Is Aunt Maggie goin' ter be put in your book, Mr."Why--er--yes; her name will be entered as the daughter of the man who
married the Widow Blaisdell, probably.Aunt Maggie don't have
nothin' much, yer know, except her father an' housework--housework
either for him or some of us.An' I guess she's had quite a lot of
things ter bother her, an' make her feel bad, so I hoped she'd be in
the book.Though if she wasn't, she'd just laugh an' say it doesn't
matter, of course."Yes, when things plague, an' somethin' don't go right.She says it
helps a lot ter just remember that it doesn't matter."Well, no,--I don't think I do see," frowned Mr."Oh, yes," plunged in Benny; "'cause, you see, if yer stop ter think
about it--this thing that's plaguin' ye--you'll see how really small
an' no-account it is, an' how, when you put it beside really big things
it doesn't matter at all--it doesn't REALLY matter, ye know.Aunt
Maggie says she's done it years an' years, ever since she was just a
girl, an' somethin' bothered her; an' it's helped a lot.""But there are lots of things that DO matter," persisted Mr.Benny swelled a bit importantly, "I know what you mean.Aunt
Maggie says that, too; an' she says we must be very careful an' not get
it wrong.It's only the little things that bother us, an' that we wish
were different, that we must say 'It doesn't matter' about.It DOES
matter whether we're good an' kind an' tell the truth an' shame the
devil; but it DOESN'T matter whether we have ter live on the West Side
an' eat dinner nights instead of noons, an' not eat cookies any of the
time in the house,--see?""Good for you, Benny,--and good for Aunt Maggie!"Oh, you don't know Aunt Maggie, yet.She's always tryin'
ter make people think things don't matter.A moment later he had turned down his own street, and Mr.Very often, in the days that followed, Mr.Smith thought of this speech
of Benny's.He had opportunity to verify it, for he was seeing a good
deal of Miss Maggie, and it seemed, indeed, to him that half the town
was coming to her to learn that something "didn't matter"--though very
seldom, except to Benny, did he hear her say the words themselves.It
was merely that to her would come men, women, and children, each with a
sorry tale of discontent or disappointment.And it was always as if
they left with her their burden, for when they turned away, head and
shoulders were erect once more, eyes were bright, and the step was
alert and eager.For that matter, he wondered how she
did--a great many things.Smith was, indeed, seeing a good deal of Miss Maggie these days.He
told himself that it was the records that attracted him.Sometimes he just sat in one of the comfortable
chairs and watched Miss Maggie, content if she gave him a word now and
then.He liked the way she carried her head, and the way her hair waved away
from her shapely forehead.He liked the quiet strength of the way her
capable hands lay motionless in her lap when their services were not
required.He liked to watch for the twinkle in her eye, and for the
dimple in her cheek that told a smile was coming.He liked to hear her
talk to Benny.He even liked to hear her talk to her father--when he
could control his temper sufficiently.Best of all he liked his own
comfortable feeling of being quite at home, and at peace with all the
world--the feeling that always came to him now whenever he entered the
house, in spite of the fact that the welcome accorded him by Mr.Duff
was hardly more friendly than at the first.Smith it was a matter of small moment whether Mr.Duff welcomed
him cordially or not.He even indulged now and then in a bout of his
own with the gentleman, chuckling inordinately when results showed that
he had pitched his remark at just the right note of contrariety to get
what he wanted.Smith, at least nominally, spent his
time at his legitimate task of studying and copying the Blaisdell
family records, of which he was finding a great number.Rufus Blaisdell
apparently had done no little "digging" himself in his own day, and Mr.Smith told Miss Maggie that it was all a great "find" for him.She said that she was glad if she could be
of any help to him, and she told him to come whenever he liked.She
arranged the Bible and the big box of papers on a little table in the
corner, and told him to make himself quite at home; and she showed so
plainly that she regarded him as quite one of the family, that Mr.Smith might be pardoned for soon considering himself so.It was while at work in this corner that he came to learn so much of
Miss Maggie's daily life, and of her visitors.Although many of these visitors were strangers to him, some of them he
knew.Hattie Blaisdell, with a countenance even more
florid than usual.She was breathless and excited, and her eyes were
worried.She was going to give a luncheon, she said.She wanted Miss
Maggie's silver spoons, and her forks, and her hand painted
sugar-and-creamer, and Mother Blaisdell's cut-glass dish.Smith, supposing that Miss Maggie herself was to be at the
luncheon, was just rejoicing within him that she was to have this
pleasant little outing, when he heard Mrs.Blaisdell telling her to be
sure to come at eleven to be in the kitchen, and asking where could she
get a maid to serve in the dining-room, and what should she do with
Benny.He'd have to be put somewhere, or else he'd be sure to upset
everything.Smith did not hear Miss Maggie's answer to all this, for she
hurried her visitor to the kitchen at once to look up the spoons, she
said.But indirectly he obtained a very conclusive reply; for he found
Miss Maggie gone one day when he came; and Benny, who was in her place,
told him all about it, even to the dandy frosted cake Aunt Maggie had
made for the company to eat.Jane had a tired
frown between her brows and a despairing droop to her lips.She carried
a large bundle which she dropped unceremoniously into Miss Maggie's lap."There, I'm dead beat out, and I've brought it to you.You've just got
to help me," she finished, sinking into a chair."Why, of course, if I can.Miss Maggie's deft fingers
were already untying the knot.But I thought the last time it couldn't ever be done again.""Yes, I know; but there's lots of good in it yet," interposed Mrs.Jane
decidedly; "and I've bought new velvet and new lace, and some buttons
and a new lining.I THOUGHT I could do it alone, but I've reached a
point where I just have got to have help."Yes, of course, but"--Miss Maggie was lifting a half-finished sleeve
doubtfully--"why didn't you go to Flora?She'd know exactly--"

Mrs."Because I can't afford to go to Flora," she interrupted coldly."I
have to pay Flora, and you know it.If I had the money I should be glad
to do it, of course.But I haven't, and charity begins at home I think.Besides, I do go to her for NEW dresses.Of
course, if you don't WANT to help me--"

"Oh, but I do," plunged in Miss Maggie hurriedly."Come out into the
kitchen where we'll have more room," she exclaimed, gathering the
bundle into her arms and springing to her feet."I've got some other lace at home--yards and yards.I got a lot, it was
so cheap," recounted Mrs."But I'm afraid
it won't do for this, and I don't know as it will do for anything, it's
so--"

The kitchen door slammed sharply, and Mr.Half an
hour later, however, he saw Mrs.The frown was
gone from her face and the droop from the corners of her mouth.Miss Flora's thin little face looked
more pinched than ever, and her eyes more anxious, Mr.Smith's greeting, was so wan he
wished she had not tried to give it.She sat down then, by the window, and began to chat with Miss Maggie;
and very soon Mr.Smith heard her say this:--

"No, Maggie, I don't know, really, what I am going to do--truly I
don't.Why, I don't earn enough to pay my
rent, hardly, now, ter say nothin' of my feed.""But I thought that Hattie--ISN'T Hattie having some new dresses--and
Bessie, too?""Yes, oh, yes; they are having three or four.But they don't come to ME
any more.They've gone to that French woman that makes the Pennocks'
things, you know, with the queer name.And of course it's all right,
and you can't blame 'em, livin' on the West Side, as they do now.And,
of course, I ain't so up ter date as she is.(Miss Maggie laughed merrily, but Mr.Smith, copying dates at the table, detected a note in the laugh that
was not merriment.)"You're up to date enough for me.I've got just the
job for you, too."Why, Maggie, you haven't, either!"(In spite of the
incredulity of voice and manner, Miss Flora sprang joyfully to her
feet.)"You never had me make you a--" Again the kitchen door slammed
shut, and Mr.Smith was left to finish the sentence for himself.Neither was his face
expressing just then the sympathy which might be supposed to be
showing, after so sorry a tale as Miss Flora had been telling.Smith, with an actual elation of countenance, was
scribbling on the edge of his notebook words that certainly he had
never found in the Blaisdell records before him: "Two months more,
then--a hundred thousand dollars.Half an hour later, as on the previous day, Mr.Smith saw a
metamorphosed woman hurrying down the little path to the street.But
the woman to-day was carrying a bundle--and it was the same bundle that
the woman the day before had brought.Smith soon learned, were Miss Maggie's visitors
women.Besides Benny, with his grievances, young Fred Blaisdell came
sometimes, and poured into Miss Maggie's sympathetic ears the story of
Gussie Pennock's really remarkable personality, or of what he was going
to do when he went to college--and afterwards.Jim Blaisdell drifted in quite frequently Sunday afternoons, though
apparently all he came for was to smoke and read in one of the big
comfortable chairs.Smith himself had fallen into the way of
strolling down to Miss Maggie's almost every Sunday after dinner.Frank Blaisdell rattled up to the door in
his grocery wagon.His face was very red, and his mutton-chop whiskers
were standing straight out at each side.Jane had collapsed, he said, utterly collapsed.All the week she had
been house-cleaning and doing up curtains; and now this morning,
expressly against his wishes, to save hiring a man, she had put down
the parlor carpet herself.Now she was flat on her back, and supper to
be got for the boarder, and the Saturday baking yet to be done.And
could Maggie come and help them out?Smith hurried out from his corner
and insisted that "the boarder" did not want any supper anyway--and
could they not live on crackers and milk for the coming few days?But Miss Maggie laughed and said, "Nonsense!"And in an incredibly
short time she was ready to drive back in the grocery wagon.Later,
when he went home, Mr.Smith found her there, presiding over one of the
best suppers he had eaten since his arrival in Hillerton.She came
every day after that, for a week, for Mrs.Jane remained "flat on her
back" seven days, with a doctor in daily attendance, supplemented by a
trained nurse peremptorily ordered by that same doctor from the nearest
city.Miss Maggie, with the assistance of Mellicent, attended to the
housework.But in spite of the excellence of the cuisine, meal time was
a most unhappy period to everybody concerned, owing to the sarcastic
comments of Mr.Frank Blaisdell as to how much his wife had "saved" by
not having a man to put down that carpet.Mellicent had little time now to go walking or auto-riding with Carl
Pennock.Her daily life was, indeed, more pleasure-starved than
ever--all of which was not lost on Mr.Smith and Mellicent
were fast friends now.Given a man with a sympathetic understanding on
one side, and a girl hungry for that same sympathy and understanding,
and it could hardly be otherwise.Smith
knew now just how hungry a young girl can be for fun and furbelows."Of course I've got my board and clothes, and I ought to be thankful
for them," she stormed hotly to him one day.But sometimes it seems as if I'd actually be willing to go hungry
for meat and potato, if for once--just once--I could buy a five-pound
box of candy, and eat it up all at once, if I wanted to!But now, why
now I can't even treat a friend to an ice-cream soda without seeing
mother's shocked, reproachful eyes over the rim of the glass!"It was not easy then (nor many times subsequently) for Mr.Smith to
keep from asking Mellicent the utterly absurd question of how many
five-pound boxes of candy she supposed one hundred thousand dollars
would buy.But he did keep from it--by heroic self-sacrifice and the
comforting recollection that she would know some day, if she cared to
take the trouble to reckon it up.In Mellicent's love affair with young Pennock Mr.Not that he regarded it as really serious, but because it
appeared to bring into Mellicent's life something of the youth and
gayety to which he thought she was entitled.He was almost as concerned
as was Miss Maggie, therefore, when one afternoon, soon after Mrs.Jane
Blaisdell's complete recovery from her "carpet tax" (as Frank Blaisdell
termed his wife's recent illness), Mellicent rushed into the Duff
living-room with rose-red cheeks and blazing eyes, and an
explosive:--"Aunt Maggie, Aunt Maggie, can't you get mother to let me
go away somewhere--anywhere, right off?"[Illustration caption: "I CAN'T HELP IT, AUNT MAGGIE.I'VE JUST GOT TO
BE AWAY!"]And just to-morrow the Pennocks' dance?""But that's it--that's why I want to go," flashed Mellicent."I don't
want to be at the dance--and I don't want to be in town, and NOT at the
dance."Smith, at his table in the corner, glanced nervously toward the
door, then bent assiduously over his work, as being less conspicuous
than the flight he had been tempted for a moment to essay.But even
this was not to be, for the next moment, to his surprise, the girl
appealed directly to him.Smith, please, won't YOU take me somewhere to-morrow?"Even Miss Maggie was shocked now, and showed it."I can't help it, Aunt Maggie."But, my dear, to ASK a gentleman--" reproved Miss Maggie.She came to
an indeterminate pause.Smith had crossed the room and dropped into
a chair near them."See here, little girl, suppose you tell us just what is behind--all
this," he began gently.Please let it go that I want to be away."Mellicent, we can't do that.""We can't do--anything, until you tell us what it is."Mellicent's eyes, still mutinous, sought first
the kindly questioning face of the man, then the no less kindly but
rather grave face of the woman.Then in a little breathless burst it
came."It's just something they're all saying Mrs.Two little red spots had come into Miss Maggie's cheeks."It was just that--that they weren't going to let Carl Pennock go with
me any more--anywhere, or come to see me, because I--I didn't belong to
their set."Miss Maggie said nothing, but the red spots deepened.It's just--that we aren't rich like them."That you haven't got--got--Oh, ye gods!"Almost
instantly, however, he sobered: he had caught the expression of the two
faces opposite."I beg your pardon," he apologized promptly."It was only that to
me--there was something very funny about that.""But, Mellicent, are you sure?I don't believe she ever said it,"
doubted Miss Maggie."He hasn't been near me--for a week."I don't care a bit--not a bit--about THAT!"What does
it matter if she did say it, dear?"But I can't bear to have them all talk--and notice," choked Mellicent."And we were together such a lot before; and now--I tell you I CAN'T go
to that dance to-morrow night!""And you shan't, if you don't want to," Mr."Right
here and now I invite you and your Aunt Maggie to drive with me
to-morrow to Hubbardville.There are some records there that I want to
look up.It will take all day, and we
shan't be home till late in the evening.I'll go straight now
and telephone to somebody--everybody--that I shan't be there; that I'm
going to be OUT OF TOWN!"She sprang joyously to her feet--but Miss
Maggie held out a restraining hand.You don't care--you SAID you didn't care--that
Carl Pennock doesn't come to see you any more?""Then you wouldn't want others to think you did, would you?""You have said that you'd go to this party, haven't you?That is, you
accepted the invitation, didn't you, and people know that you did,
don't they?"But--just what do you think these people are going to say
to-morrow night, when you aren't there?""Why, that I--I--" The color drained from her face and left it white."They wouldn't EXPECT me to go after that--insult.""Then they'll understand that you--CARE, won't they?""Why, I--I--They--I CAN'T--" She turned sharply and walked to the
window.For a long minute she stood, her back toward the two watching
her.Then, with equal abruptness, she turned and came back.Her cheeks
were very pink now, her eyes very bright.She carried her head with a
proud little lift.Smith, that I won't go with you to-morrow, after all,"
she said steadily."I've decided to go--to that dance."The next moment the door shut crisply behind her.CHAPTER VIII

A SANTA CLAUS HELD UP


It was about five months after the multi-millionaire, Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton, had started for South America, that Edward D. Norton, Esq.,
received the following letter:--

DEAR NED:--I'm glad there's only one more month to wait.I feel like
Santa Claus with a box of toys, held up by a snowdrift, and I just
can't wait to see the children dance--when they get them.And let me say right here and now how glad I am that I did this thing.Oh, yes, I'll admit I still feel like the small boy at the keyhole, at
times, perhaps; but I'll forget that--when the children begin to dance.And, really, never have I seen a bunch of people whom I thought a
little money would do more good to than the Blaisdells here in
Hillerton.My only regret is that I didn't know about Miss Maggie Duff,
so that she could have had some, too.(Oh, yes, I've found out all
about "Poor Maggie" now, and she's a dear--the typical
self-sacrificing, self-effacing bearer of everybody's burdens,
including a huge share of her own!)However, she isn't a Blaisdell, of
course, so I couldn't have worked her into my scheme very well, I
suppose, even if I had known about her.They are all fond of
her--though they impose on her time and her sympathies abominably.But
I reckon she'll get some of the benefits of the others' thousands.Jane, in particular, is always wishing she could do something for "Poor
Maggie," so I dare say she'll be looked out for all right.As to who will prove to be the wisest handler of the hundred thousand,
and thus my eventual heir, I haven't the least idea.As I said before,
they all need money, and need it badly--need it to be comfortable and
happy, I mean.They aren't really poor, any of them, except, perhaps,
Miss Flora.She is a little hard up, poor soul.I
wonder what she'll get first, Niagara, the phonograph, or something to
eat without looking at the price.Did I ever write you about those
"three wishes" of hers?I can't see that any of the family are really extravagant unless,
perhaps, it's Mrs.She IS ambitious, and is inclined
to live on a scale a little beyond her means, I judge.But that will be
all right, of course, when she has the money to gratify her tastes.Jim--poor fellow, I shall be glad to see him take it easy, for once.He
reminds me of the old horse I saw the other day running one of those
infernal treadmill threshing machines--always going, but never getting
there.He works, and works hard, and then he gets a job nights and
works harder; but he never quite catches up with his bills, I fancy.What a world of solid comfort he'll take with that hundred thousand!I
can hear him draw the long breath now--for once every bill paid!Of course, the Frank Blaisdells are the most thrifty of the bunch--at
least, Mrs.Frank, "Jane," is--and I dare say they would be the most
conservative handlers of my millions.Anyhow, I
shall be glad to see them enjoy themselves meanwhile with the hundred
thousand.Jane will be constrained to clear my room of a few
of the mats and covers and tidies!At least, I shall
surely have a vacation from her everlasting "We can't afford it," and
her equally everlasting "Of course, if I had the money I'd do it."Praise be for that!--and it'll be worth a hundred thousand to me,
believe me, Ned.As for her husband--I'm not sure how he will take it.It isn't corn or
peas or flour or sugar, you see, and I'm not posted as to his opinion
of much of anything else.He'll spend some of it, though,--I'm sure of
that.I don't think he always thoroughly appreciates his wife's thrifty
ideas of economy.I haven't forgotten the night I came home to find
Mrs.Frank rampaging around the house with
every gas jet at full blast.It seems he was packing his bag to go on a
hurried business trip.He laughed a little sheepishly--I suppose he saw
my blinking amazement at the illumination--and said something about
being tired of always feeling his way through pitch-dark rooms.So, as
I say, I'm not quite sure of Mr.Frank when he comes into possession of
the hundred thousand.He's been cooped up in the dark so long he may
want to blow in the whole hundred thousand in one grand blare of light.However, I reckon I needn't worry--he'll still have Mrs.Jane--to turn
some of the gas jets down!As for the younger generation--they're fine, every one of them; and
just think what this money will mean to them in education and
advantages!Jim's son, Fred, eighteen, is a fine, manly boy.He's got
his mother's ambitions, and he's keen for college--even talks of
working his way (much to his mother's horror) if his father can't find
the money to send him.Of course, that part will be all right now--in a
month.The daughter, Bessie (almost seventeen), is an exceedingly pretty girl.She, too, is ambitious--almost too much so, perhaps, for her happiness,
in the present state of their pocketbook.But of course that, too, will
be all right, after next month.Benny, the nine-year-old, will be
concerned as little as any one over that hundred thousand dollars, I
imagine.The real value of the gift he will not appreciate, of course;
in fact, I doubt if he even approves of it--lest his privileges as to
meals and manners be still further curtailed.Now,
Mellicent--

Perhaps in no one do I expect to so thoroughly rejoice as I do in poor
little pleasure-starved Mellicent.I realize, of course, that it will
mean to her the solid advantages of college, music-culture, and travel;
but I must confess that in my dearest vision, the child is reveling in
one grand whirl of pink dresses and chocolate bonbons.I GAVE her one five-pound box of candy, but I never repeated the
mistake.Besides enduring the manifestly suspicious disapproval of her
mother because I had made the gift, I have had the added torment of
seeing that box of chocolates doled out to that poor child at the rate
of two pieces a day.They aren't gone yet, but I'll warrant they're as
hard as bullets--those wretched bonbons.But there is yet another phase of the money business in connection with
Mellicent that pleases me mightily.A certain youth by the name of Carl
Pennock has been beauing her around a good deal, since I came.The
Pennocks have some money--fifty thousand, or so, I believe--and it is
reported that Mrs.Pennock has put her foot down on the budding
romance--because the Blaisdells HAVE NOT GOT MONEY ENOUGH!(Begin to
see where my chuckles come in?)However true this report may be, the
fact remains that the youth has not been near the house for a month
past, nor taken Mellicent anywhere.Of course, it shows him and his
family up--for just what they are; but it has been mortifying for poor
Mellicent.She's showing her pluck like a little trump, however, and
goes serenely on her way with her head just enough in the air--but not
too much.I don't think Mellicent's real heart is affected in the least--she's
only eighteen, remember--but her pride IS.Jane
is thoroughly angry as well as mortified.She says Mellicent is every
whit as good as those Pennocks, and that the woman who would let a
paltry thing like money stand in the way of her son's affections is a
pretty small specimen.For her part, she never did have any use for
rich folks, anyway, and she is proud and glad that she's poor!However, so much
for her--and she may change her opinion one of these days.My private suspicion is that young Pennock is already repentant, and is
pulling hard at his mother's leading-strings; for I was with Mellicent
the other day when we met the lad face to face on the street.Mellicent
smiled and nodded casually, but Pennock--he turned all colors of the
rainbow with terror, pleading, apology, and assumed indifference all
racing each other across his face.Dear, dear, but he was a sight!There is, too, another feature in the case.It seems that a new family
by the name of Gaylord have come to town and opened up the old Gaylord
mansion.Gaylord is a son of old Peter Gaylord, and is a millionaire.They are making quite a splurge in the way of balls and liveried
servants, and motor cars, and the town is agog with it all.There are
young people in the family, and especially there is a girl, Miss Pearl,
whom, report says, the Pennocks have selected as being a suitable mate
for Carl.At all events the Pennocks and the Gaylords have struck up a
furious friendship, and the young people of both families are in the
forefront of innumerable social affairs--in most of which Mellicent is
left out.So now you have it--the whole story.And next month comes to
Mellicent's father one hundred thousand dollars.Do you wonder I say
the plot thickens?(The man who
says health biscuit to me now gets knocked down--and I've got the
strength to do it, too!)I've gained
twenty pounds, and I'm having the time of my life.I'm even enjoying
being a genealogist--a little.I've about exhausted the resources of
Hillerton, and have begun to make trips to the neighboring towns.I can
even spend an afternoon in an old cemetery copying dates from
moss-grown gravestones, and not entirely lose my appetite for dinner--I
mean, supper.I was even congratulating myself that I was really quite
a genealogist when, the other day, I met the REAL THING.Heavens, Ned,
that man had fourteen thousand four hundred and seventy-two dates at
his tongue's end, and he said them all over to me.He knows the name of
every Blake (he was a Blake) back to the year one, how many children
they had (and they had some families then, let me tell you!), and when
they all died, and why.I was
hunting for a certain stone and I asked him a question.It was
like setting a match to one of those Fourth-of-July flower-pot
sky-rocket affairs.That question was the match that set him going, and
thereafter he was a gushing geyser of names and dates.He began at the Blaisdells, but skipped almost at once to the
Blakes--there were a lot of them near us.In five minutes he had me
dumb from sheer stupefaction.In ten minutes he had made a century run,
and by noon he had got to the Crusades.We went through the Dark Ages
very appropriately, waiting in an open tomb for a thunderstorm to pass.We had got to the year one when I had to leave to drive back to
Hillerton.I've invited him to come to see Father Duff.I thought I'd
like to have them meet.He knows a lot about the Duffs--a Blake married
one, 'way back somewhere.I'd like to hear him and Father Duff
talk--or, rather, I'd like to hear him TRY to talk to Father Duff.Did
I ever write you Father Duff's opinion of genealogists?I'm not seeing so much of Father Duff these days.Now that it's grown a
little cooler he spends most of his time in his favorite chair before
the cook stove in the kitchen.It should be shipped by freight and read
in sections.But I wanted you to know how things are here.You can
appreciate it the more--when you come.You're not forgetting, of course, that it's on the first day of
November that Mr.Stanley G. Fulton's envelope of instructions is to be
opened.As ever yours,

JOHN SMITH.CHAPTER IX

"DEAR COUSIN STANLEY"


It was very early in November that Mr.Smith, coming home one
afternoon, became instantly aware that something very extraordinary had
happened.Frank Blaisdell, his wife, Jane,
and their daughter, Mellicent.Mellicent's cheeks were pink, and her
eyes more star-like than ever.Her
eyes were excited, but incredulous.Frank was still in his white
work-coat, which he wore behind the counter, but which he never wore
upstairs in his home.It was an ecstatic cry from Mellicent that came first to Mr.Smith, you can't guess what's happened!You
couldn't guess in a million years!"Smith was looking almost as happily
excited as Mellicent herself.Mellicent clasped her hands before her.Smith,
we are going to have a hundred thousand--"

"Mellicent, I wouldn't talk of it--yet," interfered her mother sharply."But, mother, it's no secret."Of course not--if it's true.But it isn't true," retorted the woman,
with excited emphasis."No man in his senses would do such a thing."Smith, looking suddenly a little less
happy."Leave a hundred thousand dollars apiece to three distant relations he
never saw.""But he was our cousin--you said he was our cousin," interposed
Mellicent, "and when he died--"

"The letter did not say he had died," corrected her mother."He just
hasn't been heard from.But he will be heard from--and then where will
our hundred thousand dollars be?""But the lawyer's coming to give it to us," maintained Mr."Here, read this,
please, and tell us if we have lost our senses--or if somebody else
has."A close observer might have noticed that his
hand shook a little.The letterhead carried the name of a Chicago law
firm, but Mr.He plunged at once into the
text of the letter.I want to hear it again," pleaded Mellicent.Smith then, after clearing his throat),--I
understand that you are a distant kinsman of Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, the
Chicago millionaire.Fulton left this city on what was reported to
be a somewhat extended exploring tour of South America.Before his
departure he transferred to me, as trustee, certain securities worth
about $300,000.He left with me a sealed envelope, entitled "Terms of
Trust," and instructed me to open such envelope in six months from the
date written thereon--if he had not returned--and thereupon to dispose
of the securities according to the terms of the trust.I will add that
he also left with me a second sealed envelope entitled "Last Will and
Testament," but instructed me not to open such envelope until two years
from the date written thereon.I have opened the envelope
entitled "Terms of Trust," and find that I am directed to convert the
securities into cash with all convenient speed, and forthwith to pay
over one third of the net proceeds to his kinsman, Frank G. Blaisdell;
one third to his kinsman, James A. Blaisdell; and one third to his
kinswoman, Flora B. Blaisdell, all of Hillerton.I shall, of course, discharge my duty as trustee under this instrument
with all possible promptness.Some of the securities have already been
converted into cash, and within a few days I shall come to Hillerton to
pay over the cash in the form of certified checks; and I shall ask you
at that time to be so good as to sign a receipt for your share.Meanwhile this letter is to apprise you of your good fortune and to
offer you my congratulations.Very truly yours,

EDWARD D. NORTON."Well, what do you think of it?"Frank Blaisdell, his arms
akimbo."Why, it's fine, of course."Then it's all straight, you think?""Je-hos-a-phat!""But he'll come back--you see if he don't!"You'll still have your hundred thousand," smiled Mr.I doubt if he could, if he wanted to.""And we're really going to have a whole hundred thousand dollars?""I reckon you are--less the inheritance tax, perhaps."Do you mean we've
got to PAY because we've got that money?""Why, y-yes, I suppose so.Isn't there an inheritance tax in this
State?"Jane's lips were at their most economical
pucker."Do we have to pay a GREAT deal?Isn't there any way to save
doing that?""No, there isn't," cut in her husband crisply."And I guess we can pay
the inheritance tax--with a hundred thousand to pay it out of.We're
going to SPEND some of this money, Jane."The telephone bell in the hall jangled its peremptory summons, and Mr.In a minute he returned, a new excitement on his
face.And they've got it, too, haven't they?""And Aunt Flora, and--" She stopped suddenly, a growing dismay in her
eyes."Why, he didn't--he didn't leave a cent to AUNT MAGGIE!"There was genuine concern
in Frank Blaisdell's voice."But we can give her some of ours, mother,--we can give her some of
ours," urged the girl."It isn't ours to give--yet," remarked her mother, a bit coldly."But, mother, you WILL do it," importuned Mellicent."You've always
said you would, if you had it to give.""And I say it again, Mellicent.I shall never see her suffer, you may
be sure,--if I have the money to relieve her.But--" She stopped
abruptly at the sound of an excited voice down the hall.Miss Flora,
evidently coming in through the kitchen, was hurrying toward them."Jane--Mellicent--where are you?she
panted, as she reached the room and sank into a chair."Did you ever
hear anything like it in all your life?You had one, too, didn't you?"she cried, her eyes falling on the letter in her brother's hand."But
'tain't true, of course!"Miss Flora wore no head-covering.She wore one glove (wrong side out),
and was carrying the other one.Her dress, evidently donned hastily for
the street, was unevenly fastened, showing the topmost button without a
buttonhole.Smith says it's true," triumphed Mellicent.So almost accusing was the look in her eyes that Mr."Why--er--ah--the letter speaks for itself Miss Flora," he stammered."But it CAN'T be true," reiterated Miss Flora."The idea of a man I
never saw giving me a hundred thousand dollars like that!--and Frank
and Jim, too!""But he's your cousin--you said he was your cousin," Mr."And you have his picture in your album.I didn't know HE knew I was his cousin.I
don't s'pose he's got MY picture in HIS album!It's some other Flora Blaisdell, I tell you.""There, I never thought of that," cried Jane."It probably is some
other Blaisdells.Well, anyhow, if it is, we won't have to pay that
inheritance tax.At this moment the rattling of the front-door knob and an imperative
knocking brought Mrs."There's Hattie, now, and that door's locked," she cried, hurrying into
the hall.When she returned a moment later Harriet Blaisdell and Bessie were with
her.Harriet Blaisdell a new, indescribable air of
commanding importance.Smith she appeared to have grown inches
taller."Well, I do hope, Jane, NOW you'll live in a decent place," she was
saying, as they entered the room, "and not oblige your friends to climb
up over a grocery store.""Well, I guess you can stand the grocery store a few more days, Hattie,"
observed Frank Blaisdell dryly."How long do you s'pose we'd live--any
of us--if 'twa'n't for the grocery stores to feed us?I told him I was coming here, and to come right over
himself at once; that the very first thing we must have was a family
conclave, just ourselves, you know, so as to plan what to give out to
the public."Smith was on his feet, looking somewhat embarrassed;
"perhaps, then, you would rather I were not present at the--er--family
conclave.""Why, you ARE one of the family,'seems so," cried Mellicent."Besides, you are interested in what concerns us, I know--for the book;
so, of course, you'll be interested in this legacy of dear Cousin
Stanley's."Smith collapsed suddenly behind his handkerchief, with one of the
choking coughs to which he appeared to be somewhat addicted."Ain't you getting a little familiar with 'dear Cousin Stanley,'
Hattie?""But, Hattie, we were just sayin', 'fore you came, that it couldn't be
true; that it must mean some other Blaisdells somewhere.""There couldn't be any other Frank and Jim
and Flora Blaisdell, in a Hillerton, too.Besides, Jim said over the
telephone that that was one of the best law firms in Chicago.Don't you
suppose they know what they're talking about?I'm sure, I think it's
quite the expected thing that he should leave his money to his own
people.Come, don't let's waste any more time over that.What we've got
to decide is what to DO.First, of course, we must order expensive
mourning all around.""I
never thought--" He stopped abruptly, his face almost purple.Bessie Blaisdell had the floor."Why, mother, I look perfectly horrid in black, you know I do," she was
wailing."And there's the Gaylords' dance just next week; and if I'm in
mourning I can't go there, nor anywhere.What's the use in having all
that money if we've got to shut ourselves up like that, and wear horrid
stuffy black, and everything?"spoke up Miss Flora, with unusual sharpness for
her.I'm sure the least we can do
in return for this wonderful gift is to show our respect and
appreciation by going into the very deepest black we can.I'm sure I'd
be glad to."Harriet had drawn her brows together in deep thought."I'm
not sure, after all, that it would be best.The letter did not say that
dear Cousin Stanley had died--he just hadn't been heard from.In that
case, I don't think we ought to do it.And it would be too bad--that
Gaylord dance is going to be the biggest thing of the season, and of
course if we WERE in black--No; on the whole, I think we won't, Bessie.Of course, in two years from now, when we get the rest, it will be
different."There's another letter to be opened in two years
from now, disposing of the rest of the property.And he was worth
millions, you know, millions!""But maybe he--er--Did it say you were to--to get those millions then?""Oh, no, it didn't SAY it, Mr.Harriet Blaisdell's smile
was a bit condescending.He just didn't give it all now because he wanted to give
himself two more years to come back in, I suppose.And, of course, if he hadn't come back by then, he would be
dead.Oh, yes, we shall get it, I'm sure."Well, I wouldn't spend them millions--till I'd got 'em,
Hattie," advised her brother-in-law dryly."I wasn't intending to, Frank," she retorted with some dignity."But
that's neither here nor there.What we're concerned with now is what to
do with what we have got.Even this will make a tremendous sensation in
Hillerton.It ought to be written up, of course, for the papers, and by
some one who knows.Why, Frank, do you
realize?We shall be rich--RICH--and all in a flash like this!I wonder
what the Pennocks will say NOW about Mellicent's not having money
enough for that precious son of theirs!Think what we can do for the
children.Think--"

"Aunt Jane, Aunt Jane, is ma here?"Wide open banged the front door as
Benny bounded down the hall.Tommy
Hooker says our great-grandfather in Africa has died an' left us a
million dollars, an' that we're richer'n Mr.Pennock or even the
Gaylords, or anybody!"Not quite, Benny, though we have been left a nice little fortune by
your cousin, Stanley G. Fulton--remember the name, dear, your cousin,
Stanley G. Fulton.And it wasn't Africa, it was South America.""And did you all get some, too?"panted Benny, looking eagerly about
him."We sure did," nodded his Uncle Frank, "all but poor Mr.Stanley G. Fulton didn't know he was a cousin, too," he
joked, with a wink in Mr.She got some, too, didn't
she?"Your Aunt Maggie is not a Blaisdell at all.She's a Duff--a very different family.""I don't care, she's just as good as a Blaisdell," cut in Mellicent;
"and she seems like one of us, anyway.""Say," he turned
valiantly to Mr.Smith, "shouldn't you think he might have given Aunt
Maggie a little of that money?""I guess he would if he'd known her!"Once more the peculiar earnestness vibrated
through Mr."But now he's dead, an' he can't.I guess if he could see Aunt Maggie
he'd wish he hadn't died 'fore he could fix her up just as good as the
rest."Smith was laughing now, but his voice was
just as emphatic, and there was a sudden flame of color in his face."Your Cousin Stanley isn't dead, my dear,--that is, we are not sure he
is dead," spoke up Benny's mother quickly."He just has not been heard
from for six months.""But he must be dead, or he'd have come back," reasoned Miss Flora,
with worried eyes; "and I, for my part, think we OUGHT to go into
mourning, too.""Of course he'd have come back," declared Mrs.Jane, "and kept the
money himself.Don't you suppose he knew what he'd written in that
letter, and don't you suppose he'd have saved those three hundred
thousand dollars if he could?"Well, anyhow, we're not going into mourning till we have to."Harriet's lips snapped together with firm decision.I'm sure I don't see any use in having the money if
we've got to wear black and not go anywhere," pouted Bessie."Are we rich, then, really, ma?""Richer 'n the Pennocks?""Well--hardly that"--her face clouded perceptibly--"that is, not until
we get the rest--in two years.""Then, if we're rich we can have everything we want, can't we?"Benny's
eyes were beginning to sparkle."I guess there'll be enough to satisfy your wants, Benny," laughed his
Uncle Frank."Then we can go back to the East Side and live just as we've a mind to,
without carin' what other folks do, can't we?""Cause if we
ARE rich we won't have ter keep tryin' ter make folks THINK we are.The rest were laughing; but Benny's mother had raised shocked
hands of protest.We shall live in a house of our own, now, of course--but it won't be on
the East Side.""And Fred'll go to college," put in Miss Flora eagerly."Yes; and I shall send Bessie to a fashionable finishing school," bowed
Mrs."Hey, Bess, you've got ter be finished," chuckled Benny.pouted Bessie, looking not altogether
pleased."Hasn't she got to be finished, too?""Mellicent hasn't got the money to be finished--yet," observed Mrs."Oh, I don't know what I'm going to do," breathed Mellicent, drawing an
ecstatic sigh."But I hope I'm going to do--just what I want to, for
once!""And I'll make you some pretty dresses that you can wear right off,
while they're in style," beamed Miss Flora.Frank Blaisdell gave a sudden laugh."But what are YOU going to do, Flo?Here you've been telling what
everybody else is going to do with the money."A blissful sigh, very like Mellicent's own, passed Miss Flora's lips."Oh, I don't know," she breathed in an awe-struck voice."It don't seem
yet--that it's really mine.""Well, 't isn't," declared Mrs."And
I, for one, am going back to work--in the kitchen, where I belong.And--Well, if here ain't Jim at last," she broke off, as her younger
brother-in-law appeared in the doorway."You're too late, pa, you're too late!"I knew they would have, Benny; and I haven't been needed, I'm
sure,--your mother's here."Harriet bridled, but did not look unpleased."But, say, Jim," breathed Miss Flora, "ain't it wonderful--ain't it
perfectly wonderful?""It is, indeed,--very wonderful," replied Mr.Jim

A Babel of eager voices arose then, but Mr.Jim's face, and trying to fathom its
expression.A little later, when the women had gone into the kitchen and Mr.Frank
had clattered back to his work downstairs, Mr.Smith thought he had the
explanation of that look on Mr.Jim and Beany were
standing over by the fireplace together."Pa, ain't you glad--about the money?""I should be, shouldn't I, my son?""But you look--so funny, and you didn't say anything, hardly."The man, with his eyes fixed on the glowing
coals in the grate, appeared not to have heard.But in a moment he
said:--

"Benny, if a poor old horse had been climbing a long, long hill all day
with the hot sun on his back, and a load that dragged and dragged at
his heels, and if he couldn't see a thing but the dust of the road that
blinded and choked him, and if he just felt that he couldn't go another
step, in spite of the whip that snapped 'Get there--get there!'all day
in his ears--how do you suppose that poor old horse would feel if
suddenly the load, and the whip, and the hill, and the dust
disappeared, and he found himself in a green pasture with the cool
gurgle of water under green trees in his ears--how do you suppose that
poor old horse would feel?""Say, he'd like it great, wouldn't he?But, pa, you didn't tell me yet
if you liked the money."The man stirred, as if waking from a trance.He threw his arm around
Benny's shoulders.Why, of course, I like it, Benny, my boy!Why, I'm going to
have time now--to get acquainted with my children!"Smith, with a sudden tightening of his throat,
slipped softly into the hall and thence to his own room.Smith,
just then, did not wish to be seen.CHAPTER X

WHAT DOES IT MATTER?The days immediately following the receipt of three remarkable letters
by the Blaisdell family were nerve-racking for all concerned.Jane's insistence that they weren't sure yet that the thing was
true, the family steadfastly refused to give out any definite
information.Even the eager Harriet yielded to Jane on this point,
acknowledging that it WOULD be mortifying, of course, if they SHOULD
talk, and nothing came of it.Their enigmatic answers to questions, and their expressive shrugs and
smiles, however, were almost as exciting as the rumors themselves; and
the Blaisdells became at once a veritable storm center of surmises and
gossip--a state of affairs not at all unpleasing to some of them, Mrs.Miss Maggie Duff, however, was not so well pleased.Smith, one
day, she freed her mind--and Miss Maggie so seldom freed her mind that
Mr."I wish," she began, "I do wish that if that Chicago lawyer is coming,
he'd come, and get done with it!Certainly the present state of affairs
is almost unbearable.""It does make it all the harder for you, to have it drag along like
this, doesn't it?""That you are not included in the bequest, I mean."Besides, as I've told
you before, there is no earthly reason why I should have been included.It's the delay, I mean, for the Blaisdells--for the whole town, for
that matter.and 'They say' is getting on
my nerves!""Why, Miss Maggie, I didn't suppose you HAD any nerves," bantered the
man."But even the gossip and the questioning aren't the worst.Between Hattie's pulling one way and Jane the other,
I feel like a bone between two quarrelsome puppies.Hattie is already
house-hunting, on the sly, and she's bought Bessie an expensive watch
and a string of gold beads.Jane, on the other hand, insists that Mr.Fulton will come back and claim the money, so she's running her house
now on the principle that she's LOST a hundred thousand dollars, and so
must economize in every possible way."I don't have to--imagine it," murmured the man.Flora, poor soul, went into a restaurant the other day and
ordered roast turkey, and now she's worrying for fear the money won't
come and justify her extravagance.Mellicent, with implicit faith that
the hundred thousand is coming wants to wear her best frocks every day.And, as if she were not already quite excited enough, young Pennock has
very obviously begun to sit up and take notice.""You don't mean he is trying to come back--so soon!""Well, he's evidently caught the glitter of the gold from afar," smiled
Miss Maggie."At all events, he's taking notice.""Doesn't see him, APPARENTLY.But she comes and tells me his every last
move (and he's making quite a number of them just now!), so I think she
does see--a little."She's just excited now, as any young girl would
be; and I'm afraid she's taking a little wicked pleasure in--not seeing
him.""But it's all bad--this delay," chafed Miss Maggie again.That's why I do wish that
lawyer would come, if he's coming.""I reckon he'll be here before long," murmured Mr.Smith, with an
elaborately casual air."But--I wish you were coming in on the deal."His kindly eyes were gazing straight into her face now."I'm a Duff, not a Blaisdell--except when they want--" She bit her lip."I mean, I'm not a Blaisdell at all,"
she finished hastily."You're not a Blaisdell--except when they want something of you!""Oh PLEASE, I didn't mean to say--I DIDN'T say--THAT," cried Miss
Maggie, in very genuine distress."No, I know you didn't, but I did," flared the man."Miss Maggie, it's
a downright shame--the way they impose on you sometimes."I like to have them--I mean, I like to do what I can for
them," she corrected hastily, laughing in spite of herself."You like to get all tired out, I suppose.""And it doesn't matter, anyway, of course," he gibed.Smith was still sitting erect, still
speaking with grim terseness."But let me tell you right here and now
that I don't approve of that doctrine of yours.""That 'It-doesn't-matter' doctrine of yours.I tell you it's very
pernicious--very!"Oh, well--it doesn't matter--if
you don't."He caught the twinkle in her eyes and threw up his hands despairingly.With a sudden businesslike air of determination Miss Maggie faced him."Just what is the matter with that doctrine, please, and what do you
mean?""I mean that things DO matter, and that we merely shut our eyes to the
real facts in the case when we say that they don't.War, death, sin,
evil--the world is full of them, and they do matter."I never say 'It doesn't matter' to war, or
death, or sin, or evil.But there are other things--"

"But the other things matter, too," interrupted the man irritably."Right here and now it matters that you don't share in the money; it
matters that you slave half your time for a father who doesn't anywhere
near appreciate you; it matters that you slave the rest of the time for
every Tom and Dick and Harry and Jane and Mehitable in Hillerton that
has run a sliver under a thumb, either literally or metaphorically.It
matters that--"

But Miss Maggie was laughing merrily.Smith, you
don't know what you are saying!"It's YOU who don't know what you are saying!""But, pray, what would you have me say?""I'd have you say it DOES matter, and I'd have you insist on having
your rights, every time."The man fell back, so sudden and so astounding was the change that had
come to the woman opposite him.She was leaning forward in her chair,
her lips trembling, her eyes a smouldering flame."What if I had insisted on my rights, all the way up?""Would I have come home that first time from college?Would I have
stepped into Mother Blaisdell's shoes and kept the house?Would I have
swept and baked and washed and ironed, day in and day out, to make a
home for father and for Jim and Frank and Flora?Would I have come back
again and again, when my beloved books were calling, calling, always
calling?Would I have seen other girls love and marry and go to homes
of their own, while I--Oh, what am I saying, what am I saying?"she
choked, covering her eyes with the back of her hand, and turning her
face away."Please, if you can, forget what I said.Indeed, I
NEVER--broke out like that--before.Smith, on his feet, was trying to
work off his agitation by tramping up and down the small room."But I am ashamed," moaned Miss Maggie, her face still averted."And I
can't think why I should have been so--so wild.It was just something
that you said--about my rights, I think.You see--all my life I've just
HAD to learn to say 'It doesn't matter,' when there were so many things
I wanted to do, and couldn't.And--don't you see?--I found out, after a
while, that it didn't really matter, half so much--college and my own
little wants and wishes as that I should do--what I had to do,
willingly and pleasantly at home.""But, good Heavens, how could you keep from tearing 'round and throwing
things?"I--I smashed a bowl once, and two cups."She
laughed shamefacedly, and met his eyes now."But I soon found--that it
didn't make me or anybody else--any happier, and that it didn't help
things at all.So I tried--to do the other way.And now, please, PLEASE
say you'll forget all this--what I've been saying.Smith turned on his heel and marched up and down the
room again.Stanley G. Fulton, if you must know, for not giving you any of
that money."Miss Maggie threw out both her hands with a
gesture of repulsion."If I've heard that word once, I've heard it a
hundred times in the last week.Sometimes I wish I might never hear it
again.""You don't want to be deaf, do you?Well, you'd have to be, to escape
hearing that word."But--" again she threw out her hands."Don't you WANT--money, really?"We have to have money, too; but
I don't think it's--everything in the world, by any means.""You don't think it brings happiness, then?""Most of--er--us would be willing to take the risk.""Now, in the case of the Blaisdells here--don't you think this money is
going to bring happiness to them?"Smith, with a concern all out of
proportion to his supposed interest in the matter, "you don't mean to
say you DON'T think this money is going to bring them happiness!"This money'll bring them happiness all right, of
course,--particularly to some of them.But I was just wondering; if you
don't know how to spend five dollars so as to get the most out of it,
how will you spend five hundred, or five hundred thousand--and get the
most out of that?"CHAPTER XI

SANTA CLAUS ARRIVES


It was not long after this that Mr.Smith found a tall, gray-haired
man, with keen gray eyes, talking with Mrs.Jane Blaisdell and
Mellicent in the front room over the grocery store.Smith, a joyful light of recognition in his eyes.Then suddenly he stooped and picked up something from the floor.When
he came upright his face was very red.He did not look at the tall,
gray-haired man again as he advanced into the room.Smith, it's the lawyer--he's come.Jane Blaisdell to the
keen-eyed man, who, also, for no apparent reason, had grown very red.Smith's a Blaisdell, too,--distant, you know.He's doing a
Blaisdell book."The lawyer smiled
and held out his hand, but there was an odd constraint in his manner."So you're a Blaisdell, too, are you?"Smith, smiling straight into the lawyer's eyes."But not near enough to come in on the money, of course," explained
Mrs."He isn't a Hiller-Blaisdell.He's just boarding here, while
he writes his book.So he isn't near enough to come in--on the money."This time
it was the lawyer who was smiling straight into Mr.A sudden question from Mellicent seemed
to freeze the smile on his lips.Norton, please, what was Mr."Why--er--you must have seen his pictures in the papers," stammered the
lawyer.Smith with a bland
smile, as he seated himself."Why--er--" The lawyer came to a still more unhappy pause."Of course, we've seen his pictures," broke in Mellicent, "but those
don't tell us anything.So won't you tell us what he
was like, please, while we're waiting for father to come up?Was he
nice and jolly, or was he stiff and haughty?Smith, for some
reason, seemed to be highly amused.Oh, just an ordinary man, you know,--somewhat conceited, of
course."(A queer little half-gasp came from Mr.Smith, but the lawyer
was not looking at Mr."Eccentric--you've heard that, probably.And he HAS done crazy things, and no mistake.Of course, with his money
and position, we won't exactly say he had bats in his belfry--isn't
that what they call it?--but--"

Mr.Smith gave a real gasp this time, and Mrs.Jane Blaisdell
ejaculated:--

"There, I told you so!And now he'll come
back and claim the money.And if we've gone and
spent any of it--" A gesture of despair finished her sentence."Give yourself no uneasiness on that score, madam," the lawyer assured
her gravely."I think I can safely guarantee he will not do that.""I did not say that, madam.I said I was very sure he would not come
back and claim this money that is to be paid over to your husband and
his brother and sister.Dead or alive, he has no further power over
that money now."Smith says we've probably got to pay a tax on it," thrust in
Mrs."Do you know how much we'll HAVE to pay?And isn't there any way we can save doing that?"Norton could answer, a heavy step down the hall heralded Mr.Frank Blaisdell's advance, and in the ensuing confusion of his arrival,
Mr.As he passed the lawyer, however, Mellicent
thought she heard him mutter, "You rascal!"But afterwards she
concluded she must have been mistaken, for the two men appeared to
become at once the best of friends.Norton remained in town several
days, and frequently she saw him and Mr.Smith chatting pleasantly
together, or starting off apparently for a walk.Mellicent was very
sure, therefore, that she must have been mistaken in thinking she had
heard Mr.Smith utter so remarkable an exclamation as he left the room
that first day.Norton in Hillerton, and for some days
afterward, the Blaisdells were too absorbed in the mere details of
acquiring and temporarily investing their wealth to pay attention to
anything else.Robert Chalmers,
and the heads of two other Hillerton banks, the three legatees set
themselves to the task of "finding a place to put it," as Miss Flora
breathlessly termed it.Hattie said that, for her part, she should like to leave their
share all in the bank: then she'd have it to spend whenever she wanted
it.She yielded to the shocked protestations of the others, however,
and finally consented that her husband should invest a large part of it
in the bonds he so wanted, leaving a generous sum in the bank in her
own name.She was assured that the bonds were just as good as money,
anyway, as they were the kind that were readily convertible into cash.Jane, when she understood the matter, was for investing every cent
of theirs where it would draw the largest interest possible.Jane
had never before known very much about interest, and she was fascinated
with its delightful possibilities.She spent whole days joyfully
figuring percentages, and was awakened from her happy absorption only
by the unpleasant realization that her husband was not in sympathy with
her ideas at all.He said that the money was his, not hers, and that,
for once in his life, he was going to have his way."His way" in this
case proved to be the prompt buying-out of the competing grocery on the
other corner, and the establishing of good-sized bank account.The rest
of the money he said Jane might invest for a hundred per cent, if she
wanted to.Jane was pleased to this extent, and asked if it were possible that she
could get such a splendid rate as one hundred per cent.She was not so pleased later, when Mr.Norton and the
bankers told her what she COULD get--with safety; and she was very
angry because they finally appealed to her husband and she was obliged
to content herself with a paltry five or six per cent, when there were
such lovely mining stocks and oil wells everywhere that would pay so
much more.She told Flora that she ought to thank her stars that SHE had the money
herself in her own name, to do just as she pleased with, without any
old-fogy men bossing her.But Flora only shivered and said "Mercy me!"and that, for her part,
she wished she didn't have to say what to do with it.She was scared
of her life of it, anyway, and she was just sure she should lose it,
whatever she did with it; and she'most wished she didn't have it, only
it would be nice, of course, to buy things with it--and she supposed
she would buy things with it, after a while, when she got used to it,
and was not afraid to spend it.Miss Flora was, indeed, quite breathless most of the time, these days.She tried very hard to give the kind gentlemen who were helping her no
trouble, and she showed herself eager always to take their advice.But
she wished they would not ask her opinion; she was always afraid to
give it, and she didn't have one, anyway; only she did worry, of
course, and she had to ask them sometimes if they were real sure the
places they had put her money were perfectly safe, and just couldn't
blow up.It was so comforting always to see them smile, and hear them
say: "Perfectly, my dear Miss Flora, perfectly!To be sure, one day, the big fat man, not Mr.Chalmers,
did snap out: "No, madam; only the Lord Almighty can guarantee a
government bond--the whole country may be blown to atoms by a volcano
to-morrow morning!"She was startled, terribly startled; but she saw at once, of course,
that it must be just his way of joking, for of course there wasn't any
volcano big enough to blow up the whole United States; and, anyway, she
did not think it was nice of him, and it was almost like swearing, to
say "the Lord Almighty" in that tone of voice.Chalmers, or to the
other man with a wart on his nose.Miss Flora had never had a check-book before, but she tried very hard
to learn how to use it, and to show herself not too stupid.She was
glad there were such a lot of checks in the book, but she didn't
believe she'd ever spend them all--such a lot of money!She had had a
savings-bank book, to be sure, but she not been able to put anything in
the bank for a long time, and she had been worrying a good deal lately
for fear she would have to draw some out, business had been so dull.But she would not have to do that now, of course, with all this money
that had come to her.They told her that she could have all the money she wanted by just
filling out one of the little slips in her check-book the way they had
told her to do it and taking it to Mr.Chalmers's bank--that there were
a good many thousand dollars there waiting for her to spend, just as
she liked; and that, when they were gone, Mr.Chalmers would tell her
how to sell some of her bonds and get more.There were other things, too, that they had told her--too many for her
to remember--something about interest, and things called coupons that
must be cut off the bonds at certain times.She tried to remember it
all; but Mr.Chalmers had been very kind and had told her not to fret.Meanwhile, he had rented her a
nice tin box (that pulled out like a drawer) in the safety-deposit
vault under the bank, where she could keep her bonds and all the other
papers--such a lot of them!--that Mr.Chalmers told her she must keep
very carefully.But it was all so new and complicated, and everybody was always talking
at once, so!No wonder, indeed, that Miss Flora was quite breathless with it all.By the time the Blaisdells found themselves able to pay attention to
Hillerton, or to anything outside their own astounding personal
affairs, they became suddenly aware of the attention Hillerton was
paying to THEM.The grocery store, the residence of Frank
Blaisdell, and Miss Flora's humble cottage might be found at nearly any
daylight hour with from one to a dozen curious-eyed gazers on the
sidewalk before them.The town paper had contained an elaborate account
of the bequest and the remarkable circumstances attending it; and
Hillerton became the Mecca of wandering automobiles for miles around.Big metropolitan dailies got wind of the affair, recognized the magic
name of Stanley G. Fulton, and sent reporters post-haste to Hillerton.Speculation as to whether the multi-millionaire was really dead was
prevalent everywhere, and a search for some clue to his reported South
American exploring expedition was undertaken in several quarters.Various rumors concerning the expedition appeared immediately, but none
of them seemed to have any really solid foundation.Interviews with the
great law firm having the handling of Mr.Fulton's affairs were
printed, but even here little could be learned save the mere fact of
the letter of instructions, upon which they had acted according to
directions, and the other fact that there still remained one more
packet--understood to be the last will and testament--to be opened in
two years' time if Mr.The lawyers were
bland and courteous, but they really had nothing to say, they declared,
beyond the already published facts.In Hillerton the Blaisdells accepted this notoriety with characteristic
variation.Miss Flora, after cordially welcoming one "nice young man,"
and telling him all about how strange and wonderful it was, and how
frightened she felt, was so shocked and distressed to find all that she
said (and a great deal that she did not say!)staring at her from the
first page of a big newspaper, that she forthwith barred her doors, and
refused to open them till she satisfied herself, by surreptitious peeps
through the blinds, that it was only a neighbor who was knocking for
admittance.An offer of marriage from a Western ranchman and another
from a Vermont farmer (both entire strangers) did not tend to lessen
her perturbation of mind.Frank, at the grocery store, rather welcomed questioners--so long as
there was a hope of turning them into customers; but his wife and
Mellicent showed almost as much terror of them as did Miss Flora
herself.James Blaisdell and Fred stoically endured such as refused to be
silenced by their brusque non-committalism.Benny, at first welcoming
everything with the enthusiasm he would accord to a circus, soon
sniffed his disdain, as at a show that had gone stale.Hattie was the only one that found in it any
real joy and comfort.Even Bessie, excited and interested as she was,
failed to respond with quite the enthusiasm that her mother showed.Hattie saw every reporter, talked freely of "dear Cousin Stanley"
and his wonderful generosity, and explained that she would go into
mourning, of course, if she knew he was really dead.She sat for two
new portraits for newspaper use, besides graciously posing for staff
photographers whenever requested to do so; and she treasured carefully
every scrap of the printed interviews or references to the affair that
she could find.She talked with the townspeople, also, and told Al
Smith how fine it was that he could have something really worth while
for his book.Smith, these days, was keeping rather closely to his work,
especially when reporters were in evidence.He had been heard to
remark, indeed, that he had no use for reporters.Certainly he fought
shy of those investigating the Fulton-Blaisdell legacy.He read the
newspaper accounts, though, most attentively, particularly the ones
from Chicago that Mr.It was in one
of these papers that he found this paragraph:--

There seems to be really nothing more that can be learned about the
extraordinary Stanley G. Fulton-Blaisdell affair.The bequests have
been paid, the Blaisdells are reveling in their new wealth, and Mr.There is nothing now to do but to await
the opening of the second mysterious packet two years hence.This, it
is understood, is the final disposition of his estate; and if he is
really dead, such will doubtless prove to be the case.There are those,
however, who, remembering the multi-millionaire's well-known
eccentricities, are suspecting him of living in quiet retirement
somewhere, laughing in his sleeve at the tempest in the teapot that he
has created; and that long before the two years are up, he will be back
on Chicago's streets, debonair and smiling as ever.The fact that so
little can be found in regard to the South American exploring
expedition might give color to this suspicion; but where on this
terrestrial ball could Mr.Stanley G. Fulton find a place to live in
UNREPORTED retirement?Smith did not show this paragraph to the Blaisdells.He destroyed
the paper containing it, indeed, promptly and effectually--with a
furtive glance over his shoulder as he did so.It was at about this
time, too, that Mr.Smith began to complain of his eyes and to wear
smoked glasses.Smith," said Benny, the first time he saw
him."Why, I didn't hardly know you!"Smith, with suddenly a beaming
countenance."Oh, well, that doesn't matter, does it?"Smith
gave an odd little chuckle as he turned away.CHAPTER XII

THE TOYS RATTLE OUT


Early in December Mrs.Hattie, after an extended search, found a
satisfactory home.It was a somewhat pretentious house, not far from
the Gaylord place.Hattie had it repapered and repainted
throughout and two new bathrooms put in.(She said that everybody who
was anybody always had lots of bathrooms.)Then she set herself to
furnishing it.She said that, of course, very little of their old
furniture would do at all.She was talking to Maggie Duff about it one
day when Mr.She was radiant that afternoon
in a handsome silk dress and a new fur coat."You're looking very well--and happy, Mrs."I am well, and I'm perfectly happy, Mr.You know about the new home, of course.Well, it's all
ready, and I'm ordering the furnishings.Oh, you don't know what it
means to me to be able at last to surround myself with all the
beautiful things I've so longed for all my life!""I'm very glad, I'm sure."Smith said the words as if he meant them."Yes, of course; and poor Maggie here, she says she's glad, too,--though
I don't see how she can be, when she never got a cent, do you, Mr.But, poor Maggie, she's got so used to being left out--"

"Hush, hush!""You'll find money isn't everything in this world, Hattie Blaisdell,"
growled Mr.Duff, who, to-day, for some unknown reason, had deserted
the kitchen cookstove for the living-room base-burner."And when I see
what a little money does for some folks I'm glad I'm poor.I wouldn't
be rich if I could.Furthermore, I'll thank you to keep your sympathy
at home."Why, Father Duff," bridled Mrs.Hattie indignantly, "you know how poor
Maggie has had to--"

"Er--but tell us about the new home," interrupted Mr.Smith quickly,
"and the fine new furnishings.""Why, there isn't much to tell yet--about the furnishings, I mean.But I can tell you what I'm GOING to have."Hattie settled herself more comfortably, and began to look happy again."As I was saying to Maggie, when you came in, I shall get almost
everything new--for the rooms that show, I mean,--for, of course, my
old things won't do at all.I want
oil paintings, of course, in gilt frames."She glanced a little
disdainfully at the oak-framed prints on Miss Maggie's walls."Going in for old masters, maybe," suggested Mr.Duff, with a sarcasm
that fell pointless at Mrs."I'm going to have anything
old in my house--where it can be seen--For once I'm going to have NEW
things--all new things.You have to make a show or you won't be
recognized by the best people.""But, Hattie, my dear," began Miss Maggie, flushing a little, and
carefully avoiding Mr.Smith's eyes, "old masters are--are very
valuable, and--"

"I don't care if they are," retorted Mrs."If
they're old, I don't want them, and that settles it.I'm going to have
velvet carpets and the handsomest lace curtains that I can find; and
I'm going to have some of those gold chairs, like the Pennocks have,
only nicer.Theirs are awfully dull, some of them.And I'm going to
buy--"

"Humph!Pity you can't buy a little common sense--somewhere!"snarled
old man Duff, getting stiffly to his feet."You'll need it, to swing
all that style.""Oh, I don't mind what Father Duff says," laughed Mrs.But
there was a haughty tilt to her chin and an angry sparkle in her eyes
as she, too, arose."I'm just going, anyway, so you don't need to
disturb yourself, Father Duff."But Father Duff, with another "Humph!"and a muttered something about
having all he wanted already of "silly chatter," stamped out into the
kitchen, with the usual emphasis of his cane at every other step.It was just as well, perhaps, that he went, for Mrs.Hattie Blaisdell
had been gone barely five minutes when her sister-in-law, Mrs."I've come to see you about a very important matter, Maggie," she
announced, as she threw off her furs--not new ones--and unbuttoned her
coat--which also was not new."Then certainly I will take myself out of the way," said Mr.Smith,
with a smile, making a move to go."Part of it
concerns you, and I'm glad you're here, anyway.I'm afraid I shall have to give up boarding you, and one thing I
came to-day for was to ask Maggie if she'd take you.I wanted to give
poor Maggie the first chance at you, of course."Smith laughed,--but unmistakably he blushed."The
first--But, my dear woman, it is just possible that Miss Maggie may
wish to--er--decline this great honor which is being conferred upon
her, and she may hesitate, for the sake of my feelings, to do it before
me.NOW I'm very sure I ought to have left at once."(Was Miss Maggie blushing the least bit, too?)"I shall be
very glad to take Mr.Smith as a boarder if he wants to come--but HE'S
got something to say about it, remember.But tell me, why are you
letting him go, Jane?""Now this surely WILL be embarrassing," laughed
Mr."Do I eat too much, or am I merely noisy,
and a nuisance generally?"She was looking at Miss
Maggie, her eyes somber, intent.She says it's perfectly absurd for me to take boarders, with all
our money; and she's making a terrible fuss about where we live.She
says she's ashamed--positively ashamed of us--that we haven't moved
into a decent place yet."Miss Maggie's lips puckered a little."Y-yes, only it will cost so much.I've always wanted a house--with a
yard, I mean; and 'twould be nice for Mellicent, of course.""Y-yes, I know I have; but it'll cost so much, Maggie.It costs not only the money itself, but all the interest that the money
could be earning.Why, Maggie, I never saw anything like it."Her face
grew suddenly alert and happy."I never knew before how much money,
just MONEY, could earn, while you didn't have to do a thing but sit
back and watch it do it.It's the most fascinating thing I ever saw.I
counted up the other day how much we'd have if we didn't spend a cent
of it for ten years--the legacy, I mean.""Aren't you going to
spend any of that money before ten years' time?"The anxious frown came again to her
face.We have spent a lot of it, already.Frank has
bought out that horrid grocery across the street, and he's put a lot in
the bank, and he spends from that every day, I know.And I'm WILLING to
spend some, of course.But we had to pay so much inheritance tax and
all that it would be my way not to spend much till the interest had
sort of made that up, you know; but Frank and Mellicent--they won't
hear to it a minute.They want to move, too, and they're teasing me all
the time to get new clothes, both for me and for her.I can't do a thing with Hattie.You say yourself you'd like to," answered Miss Maggie
promptly.Smith leaped to his feet and thrust his hands into his pockets as
he took a nervous turn about the room, before he spoke."Good Heavens, woman, that money was given you to--that is, it was
probably given you to use."But I am using it," argued Mrs."I think I'm making
the very best possible use of it when I put it where it will earn more.Besides, what does the Bible say about that man with one
talent that didn't make it earn more?"Smith turned on his heel and renewed his march."I think the only thing money is good for is to exchange it for
something you want," observed Miss Maggie sententiously.She gazed at Miss Maggie with
fondly reproving eyes."Yes, we all know your ideas of money, Maggie.You're very sweet and
dear, and we love you; but you ARE extravagant."You use everything you have every day; and you never protect a
thing.Actually, I don't believe there's a tidy or a linen slip in this
house."Smith breathe a fervent "Thank the Lord!""And that brings me right up to something else I was going
to say.I want you to know that I'm going to help you."Miss Maggie looked distressed and raised a protesting hand; but Mrs.Jane smilingly shook her head and went on.I always said I should, if I had money, and I shall--though
I must confess that I'd have a good deal more heart to do it if you
weren't quite so extravagant.But again she only smilingly shook her head and continued speaking."And if we move, I'm going to give you the parlor carpet, and some rugs
to protect it.""Thank you; but, really, I don't want the parlor carpet," refused Miss
Maggie, a tiny smouldering fire in her eyes."And I shall give you some money, too," smiled Mrs.Jane, very
graciously,--"when the interest begins to come in, you know.It's too bad you should have nothing while I
have so much."The smouldering fire in Miss Maggie's eyes had become a
flame now."Nonsense, Maggie, you mustn't be so proud.Wasn't I poor just the other day?However, since it distresses you so,
we won't say any more about it now.Then, you advise me--you both advise me--to move, do you?""I do, most certainly," bowed Miss Maggie, still with a trace of
constraint."For Heaven's sake, lady, go home, and spend--some of that money!""Well, I don't see but what I shall have to, with everybody against me
like this," she sighed, getting slowly to her feet."But if you
knew--if either of you knew--how really valuable money is, and how much
it would earn for you, if you'd only let it, I don't believe you'd be
quite so fast to tell me to go and spend it.""Perhaps not; but then, you see, we don't know," smiled Miss Maggie,
once again her cheery self.Smith faced Miss Maggie with a quizzical
smile."You mean--"

"I'm awaiting orders--as your new boarder."They'll not be alarming, I assure you.And I think it's mighty good of you to take me.But--SHOULD you, do you think?Haven't you got enough, with your father
to care for?Won't it be too hard for you?"Annabelle and Florence
Martin, a farmer's daughters are very anxious to be in town to attend
school this winter, and I have said that I would take them."I can imagine how much work you'll let them do!It strikes me the
'help' is on the other foot.I shall be
glad enough to come, and I'll stay--unless I find you're doing too much
and going beyond your strength.I'll arrange that he proposes the idea himself.Besides,"--she twinkled merrily--"you really get along wonderfully with
father, you know.And, as for the work--I shall have more time now:
Hattie will have some one else to care for her headaches, and Jane
won't put down any more carpets, I fancy, for a while.""Honestly, Miss Maggie, one of the
best things about this Blaisdell money, in my eyes, is that it may give
you a little rest from being chief cook and bottle washer and head
nurse combined, on tap for any minute.But, say, that woman WILL spend
some of that money, won't she?"I saw Frank last evening--though I didn't think it
necessary to say so to her.I think you'll find that
they move very soon, and that the ladies of the family have some new
clothes."Er--ah--well, I am," he asserted stoutly."Such a windfall
of wealth ought to bring happiness, I think; and it seemed to, to Mrs.Hattie, though, of course, she'll learn better, as time goes on how to
spend her money.Jane--And, by the way, how is Miss Flora
bearing up--under the burden?"And do I hear 'Poor Maggie' say 'Poor Flora'?""Oh, she won't be 'poor' long," smiled Miss Maggie."She'll get used to
it--this stupendous sum of money--one of these days.But just now she's
nearly frightened to death.""Yes-both because she's got it, and because she's afraid she'll lose
it.That doesn't sound logical, I know, but Flora isn't being logical
just now.To begin with, she hasn't the least idea how to spend money.Under my careful guidance, however, she has bought her a few new
dresses--though they're dead black--"

"Black!""Yes, she's put on mourning," smiled Miss Maggie, as he came to a
dismayed stop.She declared she wouldn't feel half
decent unless she did, with that poor man dead, and giving her all that
money.""But he isn't dead--that is, they aren't sure he's dead," amended Mr.She says he must be, or he would have appeared
in time to save all that money.She's very much shocked, especially at
Hattie, that there is so little respect being shown his memory.So she
is all the more determined to do the best she can on her part.""But she--she didn't know him, so she can't--er--really MOURN for him,"
stammered the man.There was a most curious helplessness on Mr."No, she says she can't really mourn," smiled Miss Maggie again, "and
that's what worries her the most of anything--because she CAN'T mourn,
and when he's been so good to her--and he with neither wife nor chick
nor child TO mourn for him, she says.But she's determined to go
through the outward form of it, at least.So she's made herself some
new black dresses, and she's bought a veil.Fulton's
picture (she had one cut from a magazine, I believe), and has had it
framed and, hung on her wall.On the mantel beneath it she keeps fresh
flowers always.She says it's the nearest she can come to putting
flowers on his grave, poor man!""And she doesn't go anywhere, except to church, and for necessary
errands.""That explains why I haven't seen her.I've
persuaded her to do that.She'll go with a party, of course,--one of
those 'personally conducted' affairs, you know.All her life she's wanted to see Niagara.Now she's going, and
she can hardly believe it's true.She wants a phonograph, too, but
she's decided not to get that until after six months' mourning is
up--it's too frivolous and jolly for a house of mourning.""It is funny, isn't it, that she takes it quite so seriously?Bessie
suggested (I'm afraid Bessie was a little naughty!)that she get the
phonograph, but not allow it to play anything but dirges and hymn
tunes.""But isn't the woman going to take ANY comfort with that money?"Smith,
what it means to her, to feel that she need never want again, and that
she can buy whatever she pleases, without thinking of the cost.That's
why she's frightened--because she IS so happy.She thinks it can't be
right to be so happy.When she isn't
being frightened about that, she's being frightened for fear she'll
lose it, and thus not have it any more.I don't think she quite
realizes yet what a big sum of money it is, and that she'd have to lose
a great deal before she lost it all.""Oh, well, she'll get used to that, in time.They'll all get used to
it--in time," declared Mr."Then
they'll begin to live sanely and sensibly, and spend the money as it
should be spent.Of course, you couldn't expect them to know what to
do, at the very first, with a sum like that dropped into their laps.Smith, his face suddenly alert and interested again."What would you do
if you should fall heir to a hundred thousand dollars--to-morrow?"Her eyes became luminous, unfathomable."There is so much that a hundred thousand dollars could do--so much!Why, I would--" Her face changed again abruptly.She sniffed as at an
odor from somewhere.Then lightly she sprang to her feet and crossed to
the stove."What would I do with a hundred thousand dollars?"she
demanded, whisking open a damper in the pipe."I'd buy a new
base-burner that didn't leak gas!That's what I'd do with a hundred
thousand dollars.I wasn't thinking of charging quite that for your board.But you seemed so interested, I didn't know but what you were going to
hand over the hundred thousand, just to see what I would do with it,"
she challenged mischievously."However, I'll stop talking nonsense, and
come down to business.New Boarder, I'll
let you choose which of two rooms you'd like."But, as had occurred once or twice before, Mr.Smith's face, as he followed her, was a study.CHAPTER XIII

THE DANCING BEGINS


Christmas saw many changes in the Blaisdell families.The James Blaisdells had moved into the big house near the Gaylord
place.Hattie had installed two maids in the kitchen, bought a
handsome touring car, and engaged an imposing-looking chauffeur.Fred
had entered college, and Bessie had been sent to a fashionable school
on the Hudson.Benny, to his disgust, had also been sent away to an
expensive school.Christmas, however, found them all at home for the
holidays, and for the big housewarming that their parents were planning
to give on Christmas night.The Frank Blaisdells had also moved.They were occupying a new house
not too far from the grocery store.Jane said that she wished to live in it awhile, so as to be sure she
would really like it.Besides, it would save the interest on the money
for that much time, anyway.True, she had been a little disturbed when
her husband reminded her that they would be paying rent meanwhile.But
she said that didn't matter; she was not going to put all that money
into a house just yet, anyway,--not till she was sure it was the best
they could do for the price.They, too, were planning a housewarming.Theirs was to come the night
after Christmas.Jane told her husband that they should not want
theirs the same night, of course, as Hattie's, and that if she had hers
right away the next night, she could eat up any of the cakes or ice
cream that was left from Hattie's party, and thus save buying so much
new for herself.But her husband was so indignant over the idea of
eating "Hattie's leavings" that she had to give up this part of her
plan, though she still arranged to have her housewarming on the day
following her sister-in-law's.Mellicent, like Bessie, was home from school, though not from the same
school.Jane had found another one that was just as good as
Bessie's, she said, and which did not cost near so much money.Smith was not living with them now, of course.He was boarding at Miss
Maggie Duff's.Miss Flora was living in the same little rented cottage she had
occupied for many years.She said that she should move, of course, when
she got through her mourning, but, until then she thought it more
suitable for her to stay where she was.She had what she wanted to eat,
now, however, and she did not do dressmaking any longer.She still did
her own housework, in spite of Harriet Blaisdell's insistence that she
get a maid.She said that there was plenty of time for all those things
when she had finished her mourning.She went out very little, though
she did go to the housewarming at her brother James's--"being a
relative, so," she decided that no criticism could be made.It seemed as if all Hillerton went to that house-warming.Those who
were not especially invited to attend went as far as the street or the
gate, and looked on enviously.Hattie had been very generous with
her invitations, however.She said that she had asked everybody who
ever pretended to go anywhere.She told Maggie Duff that, of course,
after this, she should be more exclusive--very exclusive, in fact; but
that this time Jim wanted to ask everybody, and she didn't mind so
much--she was really rather glad to have all these people see the
house, and all--they certainly never would have the chance again.Hattie had very kindly
included him in the invitation.She had asked Father Duff, too,
especially, though she said she knew, of course, that he would not
go--he never went anywhere.Father Duff bristled up at this, and
declared that he guessed he would go, after all, just to show them that
he could, if he wanted to.Hattie grew actually pale, but Miss
Maggie exclaimed joyfully that, of course, he would go--he ought to go,
to show proper respect!Father Duff said no then, very decidedly; that
nothing could hire him to go, and that he had no respect to show.He
declared that he had no use for gossip and gabble and unwholesome
eating; and he said that he should not think Maggie would care to go,
either,--unless she could be in the kitchen, where it would seem
natural to her!Hattie, however, smiled kindly, and said, of course, now she could
afford to hire better help than Maggie (caterers from the city and all
that), so Maggie would not have to be in the kitchen, and that with
practice she would soon learn not to mind at all being 'round among
folks in the parlor.Father Duff had become so apoplectically angry at this that Mr.Smith,
who chanced to be present, and who also was very angry, was forced to
forget his own wrath in his desire to make the situation easier for
Miss Maggie.He had not supposed that Miss Maggie would go at all, after that.He
had even determined not to go himself.But Miss Maggie, after a day's
thought, had laughed and had said, with her eyes twinkling: "Oh, well,
it doesn't matter, you know,--it doesn't REALLY matter, does it?"He saw almost
everybody he knew in Hillerton, and many that he did not know.He heard
the Blaisdells and their new wealth discussed from all viewpoints, and
he heard some things about the missing millionaire benefactor that were
particularly interesting--to him.The general opinion seemed to be that
the man was dead; though a few admitted that there was a possibility,
of course, that he was merely lost somewhere in darkest South America
and would eventually get back to civilization, certainly long before
the time came to open the second letter of instructions.Many professed
to know the man well, through magazine and newspaper accounts (there
were times when Mr.Smith adjusted more carefully the smoked glasses
which he was still wearing); and some had much to say of the
millionaire's characteristics, habits, and eccentricities; all of which
Mr.Then, too, there were the Blaisdells themselves.They were all there,
even to Miss Flora, who was in dead black; and Mr.Miss Flora told him that she was so happy she could not sleep nights,
but that she was rather glad she couldn't sleep, after all, for she
spent the time mourning for poor Mr.Fulton, and thinking how good he
had been to her.And THAT made it seem as if she was doing SOMETHING
for him.She said, Yes, oh, yes, she was going to stop black mourning
in six months, and go into grays and lavenders; and she was glad Mr.Smith thought that was long enough, quite long enough for the black,
but she could not think for a moment of putting on colors now, as he
suggested.She said, too, that she had decided not to go to Niagara for
the present.And when he demurred at this, she told him that really she
would rather not.It would be warmer in the spring, and she would much
rather wait till she could enjoy every minute without feeling
that--well, that she was almost dancing over the poor man's grave, as
it were.He turned away, indeed, rather
precipitately--so precipitately that Miss Flora wondered if she could
have said anything to offend him.Her dress was new, and in good style,
yet she in some way looked odd to Mr.In a moment he knew the
reason: she wore no apron.Smith had never seen her without an
apron before.Even on the street she wore a black silk one.He
complimented her gallantly on her fine appearance.Thank you, of course," she answered worriedly."But it
cost an awful lot--this dress did; but Frank and Mellicent would have
it.That child!--have you seen her to-night?"She, too is looking most
charming, Mrs."Yes, I know she is--and some other folks so, too, I notice."Well, she will be, if she isn't now."But I thought--that was broken up."YOU know what that woman said--the insult!But now, since this
money came--" She let an expressive gesture complete the sentence.I don't think he'll make much
headway--now.""Indeed, he won't--if I can help myself!""I reckon he won't stand much show with Miss Mellicent--after what's
happened.""I guess he won't," snapped the woman."He isn't worth half what SHE is
now.As if I'd let her look at HIM!"There was an odd expression
on his face.Smith, I don't know what I am going to do--with
Mellicent," she sighed.She's as wild as a hawk and as--as flighty as a humming-bird,
since this money came.Smith, looking suddenly very happy
himself."Youth is the time for joy and laughter; and I'm sure I'm glad
she is taking a little pleasure in life."Smith, you know as well as I do that life isn't all pink
dresses and sugar-plums.It is a serious business, and I have tried to
bring her up to understand it.I have taught her to be thrifty and
economical, and to realize the value of a dollar.But now--she doesn't
SEE a dollar but what she wants to spend it."You aren't sorry--the money came?"Smith was eyeing her with a
quizzical smile.Blaisdell's answer was promptly emphatic."And I hope I shall be found worthy of the gift, and able to handle it
wisely.""Er-ah--you mean--" Mr."I mean that I regard wealth as one of the greatest of trusts, to be
wisely administered, Mr."That is why it distresses me so to see my daughter so carried away
with the mere idea of spending.I thought I'd taught her differently,"
sighed the woman.He found her
in the music-room, which had been cleared for dancing.She was
surrounded by four young men.One held her fan, one carried her white
scarf on his arm, a third was handing her a glass of water.The fourth
was apparently writing his name on her dance card.The one writing on the
dance programme he knew was young Hibbard Gaylord.Leaning against a window-casing
near by, he watched the kaleidoscopic throng, bestowing a not too
conspicuous attention upon the group about Miss Mellicent Blaisdell.Mellicent was the picture of radiant loveliness.The rose in her cheeks
matched the rose of her gown, and her eyes sparkled with happiness.Smith could see, she dispensed her favors with rare
impartiality; though, as he came toward them finally, he realized at
once that there was a merry wrangle of some sort afoot.He had not
quite reached them when, to his surprise, Mellicent turned to him in
very evident relief."I'm going to sit it out
with him.I shan't dance it with either of you."protested young Gaylord and Carl Pennock abjectly.If you WILL both write your names down for the same dance, it is
nothing more than you ought to expect."Mellicent shook her head again merrily."I shan't be satisfied with anything--but to sit it out with Mr.Smith," she bowed, as she took his promptly offered arm.Smith bore her away followed by the despairing groans of the
two disappointed youths and the taunting gibes of their companions.Oh, I'm so glad you came," sighed Mellicent."And it looked like a real rescue, too.""Wasn't one of them young Pennock?""Oh, yes, he's come back.I wonder if he thinks I don't know--WHY!"She shrugged her shoulders with a demure dropping of her eyes."Oh, I let him come back--to a certain extent.I shouldn't want him to
think I cared or noticed enough to keep him from coming back--some.""But there's a line beyond which he may not pass, eh?""There certainly is!--but let's not talk of him.In a secluded corner they sat down on a gilt settee."And it's all so wonderful, this--all this!Smith, I'm so happy
I--I want to cry all the time.And that's so silly--to want to cry!So long--all my life--I've had to WAIT for things so.It was
always by and by, in the future, that I was going to have--anything
that I wanted.And now to have them like this, all at once, everything
I want--why, Mr.Smith, it doesn't seem as if it could be true."But it is true, dear child; and I'm so glad--you've got your
five-pound box of candy all at once at last.And I HOPE you can treat
your friends to unlimited soda waters."A new eagerness came to her
eyes."I'm going to give mother a present--a frivolous, foolish
present, such as I've always wanted to.I'm going to give her a gold
breast-pin with an amethyst in it.And I'm
going to take my own money for it, too,--not the new money that father
gives me, but some money I've been saving up for years--dimes and
quarters and half-dollars in my baby-bank.Mother always made me save
'most every cent I got, you see.And I'm going to take it now for this
pin.She won't mind if I do spend it foolishly now--with all the rest
we have.And she'll be so pleased with the pin!""Yes, always; but she never thought she could afford it.I'm
going to open the bank to-morrow and count it; and I'm so excited over
it!"Fulton himself ever
took more joy counting his millions than I shall take in counting those
quarters and half-dollars to-morrow."Smith spoke with confident emphasis,
yet in a voice that was not quite steady.Smith," smiled Mellicent, a bit mistily.And we miss you terribly--honestly we
do!--since you went away.But I'm glad Aunt Maggie's got you.That's the only thing that makes me feel bad,--about the money,
I mean,--and that is that she didn't have some, too.But mother's going
to give her some.She SAYS she is, and--"

But Mellicent did not finish her sentence.A short, sandy-haired youth
came up and pointed an accusing finger at her dance card; and Mellicent
said yes, the next dance was his.Smith
as she floated away, and Mr.Smith, well content, turned and walked
into the adjoining room.These two
ladies, also, were pictures of radiant loveliness--especially were they
radiant, for every beam of light found an answering flash in the
shimmering iridescence of their beads and jewels and opalescent sequins.Smith, what do you think of my party?"Hattie tapped his shoulder with her fan."I think a great deal--of your party," smiled the man."Oh, it'll do--for Hillerton."Miss Bessie smiled mischievously into
her mother's eyes, shrugged her shoulders, and passed on into the
music-room."As if it wasn't quite the finest thing Hillerton ever had--except the
Gaylord parties, of course," bridled Mrs."That's just daughter's way of teasing me--and, of course, now she IS
where she sees the real thing in entertaining--she goes home with those
rich girls in her school, you know.But this is a nice party, isn't it
Mr."Daughter says we should have wine; that everybody who is anybody has
wine now--champagne, and cigarettes for the ladies.Still, I've heard the Gaylords do.I've never been there
yet, though, of course, we shall be invited now.I'm crazy to see the
inside of their house; but I don't believe it's MUCH handsomer than
this.You've never been
there, any more than I have, and you're a man of simple tastes, I
judge, Mr."Benny says that Aunt
Maggie's got the nicest house he ever saw, and that Mr.So, you see, I have grounds for my opinion.""Well, I'm not sure I ever said just that to Benny, but I'll not
dispute it.Miss Maggie's house is indeed wonderfully delightful--to
live in.""I've no doubt of it," conceded Mrs.She always did contrive to make the most of everything she had.But
she's never been ambitious for really nice things, I imagine.At least,
she always seems contented enough with her shabby chairs and carpets.While I--" She paused, looked about her, then drew a blissful sigh.Smith, you don't know--you CAN'T know what it is to me to just look
around and realize that they are all mine--these beautiful things!"Smith, there isn't a piece of furniture in this room
that didn't cost more than the Pennocks'--I know, because I've been
there.And my curtains are nicer, too, and my pictures, they're so much
brighter--some of her oil paintings are terribly dull-looking.And my
Bessie--did you notice her dress to-night?And if you had, you wouldn't have realized how expensive it
was.What do you know about the cost of women's dresses?"It was one hundred and fifty
dollars, a HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS, and it came from New York.I
don't believe that white muslin thing of Gussie Pennock's cost fifty!"Yes, of course you have--with Fred.He
goes with Pearl Gaylord more now.There, you can see them this minute,
dancing together--the one in the low-cut, blue dress.Pretty, too,
isn't she?Her father's worth a million, I suppose.I wonder how
'twould feel to be worth--a million."She spoke musingly, her eyes
following the low-cut blue dress."But, then, maybe I shall know, some
time,--from Cousin Stanley, I mean," she explained smilingly, in answer
to the question she thought she saw behind Mr."Oh, of course, there's nothing sure about it.But he gave us SOME, and
if he's dead, of course, that other letter'll be opened in two years;
and I don't see why he wouldn't give us the rest, as long as he'd shown
he remembered he'd got us."Well--er--as to that--" Mr."Well, there aren't any other relations so near, anyway, so I can't
help thinking about it, and wondering," she interposed."And 'twould be
MILLIONS, not just one million.He's worth ten or twenty, they say.But, then, we shall know in time.""Oh, yes, you'll know--in time," agreed Mr.Smith with a smile, turning
away as another guest came up to his hostess.Smith's smile had been rather forced, and his face was still
somewhat red as he picked his way through the crowded rooms to the
place where he could see Frank Blaisdell standing alone, surveying the
scene, his hands in his pockets.Smith, this is some show, ain't it?'greeted the grocer, as
Mr.I should say so--though I can't say I'm stuck on the brand,
myself.But, as for this money business, do you know?I can't sense it yet--that it's true.Ain't she swingin' the style to-night?""She certainly is looking handsome and very happy."I believe in takin'
some comfort as you go along--not that I've taken much, in times past.Why, man, I'm just like a potato-top grown in a cellar,
and I'm comin' out and get some sunshine.SHE'S been a potato-top in a cellar all right.But now--Have you
seen her to-night?""I have--and a very charming sight she was," smiled Mr."Well, she's goin' to be
that right along now.She's GOIN' where she wants to go, and DO what
she wants to do; and she's goin' to have all the fancy fluma-diddles to
wear she wants."I'm glad to hear that, too," laughed Mr.This savin' an' savin' is all very well, of course, when
you have to.But I've saved all my life and, by jingo, I'm goin' to
spend now!I'm glad to have one on my side, anyhow.I only wish--You
couldn't talk my wife 'round to your way of thinkin', could you?"he
shrugged, with a whimsical smile."My wife's eaten sour cream to save
the sweet all her life, an' she hain't learned yet that if she'd eat
the sweet to begin with she wouldn't have no sour cream--'twouldn't
have time to get sour.She eats the specked
ones always; so she don't never eat anything but the worst there is.An' she says they're the meanest apples she ever saw.Now I tell her if
she'll only pick out the best there is every time, as I do she'll not
only enjoy every apple she eats, but she'll think they're the nicest
apples that ever grew.Here I am havin' to urge my
wife to spend money, while my sister-in-law here--Talk about ducks
takin' to the water!That ain't no name for the way she sails into
Jim's little pile.""Hain't seen him--but I can guess where he is, pretty well.You go down
that hall and turn to your left.In a little room at the end you'll
find him.He told Hattie 'twas the only room in the
house he'd ask for, but he wanted to fix it up himself.Hattie, she
wanted to buy all sorts of truck and fix it up with cushions and
curtains and Japanese gimcracks like she see a den in a book, and make
a showplace of it.There ain't
nothin' in it but books and chairs and a couch and a big table; and
they're all old--except the books--so Hattie don't show it much, when
she's showin' off the house.Jim always would rather read than eat, and he hates
shindigs of this sort a little worse 'n I do."I'll look
him up," nodded Mr.Deliberately, but with apparent carelessness, strolled Mr.Smith
through the big drawing-rooms, and down the hall.Then to the left--the
directions were not hard to follow, and the door of the room at the end
was halfway open, giving a glimpse of James Blaisdell and Benny before
the big fireplace.With a gentle tap and a cheerful "Do you allow intruders?"James Blaisdell sprang to his feet.The frown on his face
gave way to a smile."I thought--Well, never mind what I thought."Thank you, if you don't mind."Smith dropped into a chair and looked about him."It's'most as nice as Aunt Maggie's,
ain't it?And I can eat all the cookies here I want to, and come in
even if my shoes are muddy, and bring the boys in, too.""It certainly is--great," agreed Mr.Smith, his admiring eyes sweeping
the room again.The deep,
comfortable chairs, the shaded lights, the leaping fire on the hearth,
the book-lined walls--even the rhythmic voices of the distant violins
seemed to sing of peace and quietness and rest."Dad's been showin' me the books he used ter like when he was a little
boy like me," announced Benny."Hain't he got a lot of 'em?--books, I
mean."James Blaisdell stirred a little in his chair."I suppose I have--crowded them a little," he admitted."But, you see,
there were so many I'd always wanted, and when the chance came--well, I
just bought them; that's all.""And you have the time now to read them.""I have, thank--Well, I suppose I should say thanks to Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton," he laughed, with some embarrassment.Fulton could
know--how much I do thank him," he finished soberly, his eyes caressing
the rows of volumes on the shelves."You see, when you've wanted
something all your life--" He stopped with an expressive gesture."You don't care much for--that, then, I take it," inferred Mr.Smith,
with a wave of his hand toward the distant violins."Dad says there's only one thing worse than a party, and that's two
parties," piped up Benny from his seat on the rug.Smith laughed heartily, but the other looked still more discomfited."I'm afraid Benny is--is telling tales out of school," he murmured."Well, 'tis out of school, ain't it?"Smith, did you have ter go ter a private school when you were a little
boy?But if it's Cousin
Stanley's money that's made us somebody, I wished he'd kept it at
home--'fore I had ter go ter that old school.""Oh, come, come, my boy," remonstrated the father, drawing his son into
the circle of his arm."That's neither kind nor grateful; besides, you
don't know what you're talking about.From case to case, then, they went, the host eagerly displaying and
explaining, the guest almost as eagerly watching and listening.And in
the kindling eye and reverent fingers of the man handling the volumes,
Mr.Smith caught some inkling of what those books meant to Jim
Blaisdell."You must be fond of--books, Mr.Blaisdell," he said somewhat
awkwardly, after a time."Ma says dad'd rather read than eat," giggled Benny; "but pa says
readin' IS eatin'.But I'd rather have a cookie, wouldn't you, Mr."You wait till you find what there IS in these books, my son," smiled
his father."You'll love them as well as I do, some day.And your
brother--" He paused, a swift shadow on his face."My boy, Fred, loves books, too.He helped me a lot in my
buying.He was in here--a little while ago.But he couldn't stay, of
course.He said he had to go and dance with the girls--his mother
expected it."Just as if he didn't want ter go himself!""You couldn't HIRE him ter stay away--'specially if Pearl
Gaylord's 'round.""Oh, well, he's young, and young feet always dance When Pan pipes,"
explained the father, with a smile that was a bit forced."But Pan
doesn't always pipe, and he's ambitious--Fred is."The man turned
eagerly to Mr."He's going to be a lawyer--you see, he's
got a chance now.He led his class in high school,
and he'll make good in college, I'm sure.He can have the best there is
now, too, without killing himself with work to get it.He's got a fine
mind, and--" The man stopped abruptly, with a shamed laugh.You'll forgive 'the fond father,' I know.I
always forget myself when I'm talking of that boy--or, rather perhaps
it's that I'm REMEMBERING myself.You see, I want him to do all that I
wanted to do--and couldn't.And--"

"Jim, JIM!""There, I might have
known where I'd find you.Come, the guests are going, and are looking
for you to say good-night.They'll think we don't know anything--how to behave, and
all that.Smith, you'll excuse him, I know.""I must be going myself, for that
matter," he finished, as he followed his hostess through the doorway.Five minutes later he had found Miss Maggie, and was making his adieus.Miss Maggie, on the way home, was strangely silent."Well, that was some party," began Mr.[Illustration with caption: "JIM, YOU'LL HAVE TO COME!"]"I'm glad at last to see that poor child enjoying herself."Smith frowned and stole a sidewise glance at his companion.Could Miss Maggie be showing at last a tinge of envy and
jealousy?And yet--

"Even Miss Flora seemed to be having a good time, in spite of that
funereal black," he hazarded again.James Blaisdell and Miss Bessie were very radiant
and shining.""Oh, yes, they--shone."Smith bit his lip, and stole another sidewise glance.James Blaisdell was so fond of--er--books.I had
quite a chat with him in his den.""He says Fred--"

"Did you see that Gaylord girl?"Miss Maggie was galvanized into sudden
life."He's perfectly bewitched with her.And she--that ridiculous
dress--and for a young girl!Oh, I wish Hattie would let those people
alone!""Oh, well, he'll be off to college next week," soothed Mr.Her brother!--and he's worse than she is, if
anything.Why, he was drunk to-night, actually drunk, when he came!I don't want Fred with any of them.""No, I don't like their looks myself very well, but--I fancy young
Blaisdell has a pretty level head on him.His father says--"

"His father worships him," interrupted Miss Maggie.But into Fred--into Fred he's pouring his whole lost
youth.You don't understand, of course, Mr.You
haven't known him all the way, as I have."Miss Maggie's voice shook
with suppressed feeling.From boyhood he was going to write--great plays, great
poems, great novels.I think he
even tried to sell his things, in his 'teens; but of course nothing
came of that--but rejection slips.Of
course, we couldn't send him.He couldn't stand
the double task, and he broke down completely.We sent him into the
country to recuperate, and there he met Hattie Snow, fell head over
heels in love with her blue eyes and golden hair, and married her on
the spot.Of course, there was nothing to do then but to go to work,
and Mr.Hammond took him into his real estate and insurance office.He's been there ever since, plodding plodding, plodding.""You can imagine there wasn't much time left for books.I think, when
he first went there, he thought he was still going to write the great
poem, the great play the great novel, that was to bring him fame and
money.Hattie had little patience with his
scribbling, and had less with the constant necessity of scrimping and
economizing.She was always ambitious to get ahead and be somebody,
and, of course, as the babies came and the expenses increased, the
demand for more money became more and more insistent.He worked, and worked hard, and then
he got a job for evenings and worked harder.But I don't believe he
ever quite caught up.That's why I was so glad when this money
came--for Jim.he's thrown his whole lost youth
into Fred.And Fred--"

"Fred is going to make good.But--I wish those Gaylords had been at the bottom of
the Red Sea before they ever came to Hillerton," she fumed with sudden
vehemence as she entered her own gate.CHAPTER XIV

FROM ME TO YOU WITH LOVE


It was certainly a gay one--that holiday week.Beginning with the James
Blaisdells' housewarming it was one continuous round of dances,
dinners, sleigh-rides and skating parties for Hillerton's young people
particularly for the Blaisdells, the Pennocks, and the Gaylords.Smith, at Miss Maggie's, saw comparatively little of it all, though
he had almost daily reports from Benny, Mellicent, or Miss Flora, who
came often to Miss Maggie's for a little chat.It was from Miss Flora
that he learned the outcome of Mellicent's present to her mother.The
week was past, and Miss Flora had come down to Miss Maggie's for a
little visit.Smith still worked at the table in the corner of the living-room,
though the Duff-Blaisdell records were all long ago copied.He was at
work now sorting and tabulating other Blaisdell records.Smith
seemed to find no end to the work that had to be done on his Blaisdell
book.As Miss Flora entered the room she greeted Mr.Smith cordially, and
dropped into a chair."Well, they've gone at last," she panted, handing her furs to Miss
Maggie; "so I thought I'd come down and talk things over.Smith," she begged, as he made a move toward departure."I hain't
come; to say nothin' private; besides, you're one of the family,
anyhow.Smith went back to his table, and Miss Flora
settled herself more comfortably in Miss Maggie's easiest chair."So they're all gone," said Miss Maggie cheerily."Yes; an' it's time they did, to my way of thinkin'.Mercy me, what a
week it has been!They hain't been still a minute, not one of 'em,
except for a few hours' sleep--toward mornin'.""But what a good time they've had!"And didn't it do your soul good to see Mellicent?But Jane--Jane
nearly had a fit.She told Mellicent that all this gayety was nothing
but froth and flimsiness and vexation of spirit.That she knew it
because she'd been all through it when she was young, and she knew the
vanity of it.And Mellicent--what do you suppose that child said?""I can't imagine," smiled Miss Maggie."She said SHE wanted to see the vanity of it, too.Pretty cute of her,
too, wasn't it?Still it's just as well she's gone back to school, I
think myself.She's been repressed and held back so long, that when she
did let loose, it was just like cutting the puckering string of a
bunched-up ruffle--she flew in all directions, and there was no holding
her back anywhere; and I suppose she has been a bit foolish and
extravagant in the things she's asked for.Poor dear, though, she did
get one setback.""Did she tell you about the present for her mother?""That she was going to get it--yes."Miss Flora's thin lips snapped grimly over the
terse words.And 'twas a beauty--one of them light purple stones with two
pearls.Mellicent showed it to me--on the way home from the store, you
know.'Oh, I don't mind the saving all
those years now,' she cried, 'when I see what a beautiful thing they've
let me get for mother' And she went off so happy she just couldn't keep
her feet from dancing."'"I can imagine it," nodded Miss Maggie."Well, in an hour she was back.All the light
and happiness and springiness were gone.She
still carried the little box in her hand.'I'm takin' it back,' she
choked."'Oh, yes, she liked the pin,' said Mellicent, all teary;'she thinks
it's beautiful.She says she never heard
of such foolish goings-on--paying all that money for a silly, useless
pin.I--I told her 'twas a PRESENT from me, but she made me take it
back.I'm on my way now back to the store.I'm to get the money, if I
can.If I can't, I'm to get a credit slip.Mother says we can take it
up in forks and spoons and things we need.I--I told her 'twas a
present, but--' She couldn't say another word, poor child.She just
turned and almost ran from the room.She went away
this morning, I suppose.I didn't see her again, so I don't know how
she did come out with the store-man."Smith had fallen to writing furiously, with vicious little jabs of his
pencil.)"But Jane never did believe in present-giving.They never gave
presents to each other even at Christmas.She always called it a
foolish, wasteful practice, and Mellicent was always SO unhappy
Christmas morning!"Jane
never let 'em take even comfort, and now that they CAN take some
comfort, Jane's got so out of the habit, she don't know how to begin.""I don't think YOU can
say much on that score.""Why, Maggie Duff, I'M taking comfort," bridled Miss Flora."Didn't I
have chicken last week and turkey three weeks ago?And do I ever skimp
the butter or hunt for cake-rules with one egg now?And ain't I going
to Niagara and have a phonograph and move into a fine place just as
soon as my mourning is up?"All right, I'll wait," laughed Miss Maggie.Then, a bit anxiously, she
asked: "Did Fred go to-day?""Yes, looking fine as a fiddle, too.I was sweeping off the steps when
he went by the house.Said he was going in now
for real work--that he'd played long enough.He said he wouldn't be
good for a row of pins if he had many such weeks as this had been.""I'm glad he realized it," observed Miss Maggie grimly."I suppose the
Gaylord young people went, too.""Hibbard did, but Pearl doesn't go till next week.She isn't in the
same school with Bess, you know.It's even grander than Bess's they
say.Hattie wants to get Bess into it next year.Oh, I forgot; we've
got to call her 'Elizabeth' now.Hattie says nicknames are all out now, and that
'Elizabeth' is very stylish and good form and the only proper thing to
call her.She says we must call her 'Harriet,' too.But I'm afraid I shall forget--sometimes.""I'm afraid--a good many of us will," laughed Miss Maggie."It all came from them Gaylords, I believe," sniffed Flora."I don't
think much of 'em; but Hattie seems to.I notice she don't put nothin'
discouragin' in the way of young Gaylord and Bess.But he pays'most as
much attention to Mellicent, so far as I can see, whenever Carl Pennock
will give him a chance.Did you ever see the beat of that boy?I hope Mellicent'll give him a good lesson, before
she gets through with it.He deserves it," she ejaculated, as she
picked up her fur neck-piece, and fastened it with a jerk.In the doorway she paused and glanced cautiously toward Mr.Smith, perceiving the glance, tried very hard to absorb himself in the
rows of names dates before him; but he could not help hearing Miss
Flora's next words."Maggie, hain't you changed your mind a mite yet?WON'T you let me give
you some of my money?But Miss Maggie, with a violent shake of her head, almost pushed Miss
Flora into the hall and shut the door firmly.Smith, left alone at his table, wrote again furiously, and with
vicious little jabs of his pencil.Smith was finding
a most congenial home.He liked Miss Maggie better than ever, on closer
acquaintance.The Martin girls fitted pleasantly into the household,
and plainly did much to help the mistress of the house.Father Duff was
still as irritable as ever, but he was not so much in evidence, for his
increasing lameness was confining him almost entirely to his own room.This meant added care for Miss Maggie, but, with the help of the
Martins, she still had some rest and leisure, some time to devote to
the walks and talks with Mr.Smith said it was absolutely
imperative, for the sake of her health, that she should have some
recreation, and that it was an act of charity, anyway, that she should
lighten his loneliness by letting him walk and talk with her.Smith could not help wondering a good deal these days about Miss
Maggie's financial resources.He knew from various indications that
they must be slender.Yet he never heard her plead poverty or preach
economy.In spite of the absence of protecting rugs and tidies,
however, and in spite of the fact that she plainly conducted her life
and household along the lines of the greatest possible comfort, he saw
many evidences that she counted the pennies--and that she made every
penny count.He knew, for a fact, that she had refused to accept any of the
Blaisdells' legacy.Jane, to be sure, had not offered any money yet
(though she had offered the parlor carpet, which had been promptly
refused), but Frank and James and Flora had offered money, and had
urged her to take it.Miss Maggie, however would have none of it.Smith suspected that Miss Maggie was proud, and that she regarded
such a gift as savoring too much of charity.Smith wished HE could
say something to Miss Maggie.Smith was, indeed, not a little
disturbed over the matter.He did try once to say something; but Miss
Maggie tossed it off with a merry: "Take their money?I should
feel as if I were eating up some of Jane's interest, or one of Hattie's
gold chairs!"After that she would not let him get near the subject.There seemed then really nothing that he could do.It was about this
time, however, that Mr.Smith began to demand certain extra
luxuries--honey, olives, sardines, candied fruits, and imported
jellies.They were always luxuries that must be bought, not prepared in
the home; and he promptly increased the price of his board--but to a
sum far beyond the extra cost of the delicacies he ordered.When Miss
Maggie remonstrated at the size of the increase, he pooh-poohed her
objections, and declared that even that did not pay for having such a
nuisance of a boarder around, with all his fussy notions.He insisted,
moreover, that the family should all partake freely of the various
delicacies, declaring that it seemed to take away the sting of his
fussiness if they ate as he ate, and so did not make him appear
singular in his tastes.They often came to Miss Maggie's, and occasionally he
called at their homes.They seemed to regard him, indeed, as quite one of the family, and they
asked his advice, and discussed their affairs before him with as much
freedom as if he were, in truth, a member of the family.Hattie Blaisdell was having a very gay winter, and
that she had been invited twice to the Gaylords'.He knew that James
Blaisdell was happy in long evenings with his books before the fire.From Fred's mother he learned that Fred had made the most exclusive
club in college, and from Fred's father he learned that the boy was
already leading his class in his studies.He heard of Bessie's visits
to the homes of wealthy New Yorkers, and of the trials Benny's teachers
were having with Benny.He knew something of Miss Flora's placid life in her "house of
mourning" (as Bessie had dubbed the little cottage), and he heard of
the "perfectly lovely times" Mellicent was having at her finishing
school.He dropped in occasionally to talk over the price of beans and
potatoes with Mr.Frank Blaisdell in his bustling grocery store, and he
often saw Mrs.It was at Miss Maggie's, indeed,
one day, that he heard Mrs.Jane say, as she sank wearily into a
chair:--

"Well, I declare!Sometimes I think I'll never give anybody a thing
again!"Smith, at his table, was conscious of a sudden lively interest.So
often, in his earlier acquaintance with Mrs.Jane, while he boarded
there, had he heard her say to mission-workers, church-solicitors, and
doorway beggars, alike, something similar to this; "No, I can give you
nothing.I'd love to, if I could--really I
would.It makes me quite unhappy to hear of all this need and
suffering.And if I were rich I would; but
as it is, I can only give you my sympathy and my prayers."He had wondered several times,
since the money came, as to Mrs.Hence his interest now
in what she was about to say."Why, Jane, what's the matter?""And positively a more
ungrateful set of people all around I never saw.You know I've never been able to do anything.And now I was so happy that I COULD do something, and I told
them so; and they seemed real pleased at first.I gave two dollars
apiece to the Ladies' Aid, the Home Missionary Society, and the Foreign
Missionary Society--and, do you know?They
acted for all the world as if they expected more--the grasping things!On the way home, just as I passed the Gale girls' I heard
Sue say: 'What's two dollars to her?"What's the good of giving, if you aren't going to get any credit, or
thanks, just because you're rich, I should like to know?"Look at Cousin Mary Davis--YOU know how poor they've
always been, and how hard it's been for them to get along.Her
Carrie--Mellicent's age, you know--has had to go to work in Hooper's
store.Well, I sent Mellicent's old white lace party dress to Mary.'Twas some soiled, of course, and a little torn; but I thought she
could clean it and make it over beautifully for Carrie.But, what do
you think?--back it came the next day with a note from Mary saying very
crisply that Carrie had no place to wear white lace dresses, and they
had no time to make it over if she did.Didn't I invite her to my housewarming?But how
are you going to help a person like that?""But, Jane, there must be ways--some ways."Miss Maggie's forehead was
wrinkled into a troubled frown.Davis has
been sick a long time, you remember.""Yes, I know he has; and that's all the more reason, to my way of
thinking, why they should be grateful for anything--ANYTHING!The
trouble is, she wants to be helped in ways of her own choosing.They
wanted Frank to take Sam, the boy,--he's eighteen now--into the store,
and they wanted me to get embroidery for Nellie to do at home--she's
lame, you know, but she does do beautiful work.Frank hates relatives in the store; he says they cause all
sorts of trouble with the other help; and I certainly wasn't going to
ask him to take any relatives of MINE.As for Nellie--I DID ask Hattie
if she couldn't give her some napkins to do, or something, and she gave
me a dozen for her--she said Nellie'd probably do them as cheap as
anybody, and maybe cheaper.But she told me not to go to the Gaylords
or the Pennocks, or any of that crowd, for she wouldn't have them know
for the world that we had a relative right here in town that had to
take in sewing.I told her they weren't her relations nor the
Blaisdells'; they were mine, and they were just as good as her folks
any day, and that it was no disgrace to be poor.Besides, she got mad then, and took back the
dozen napkins she'd given me.So I didn't have anything for poor
Nellie.Miss Maggie's lips shut in a thin straight line."Besides, if I'd taken
them to her, they wouldn't have appreciated it, I know.Why, last November, when the money came, I sent
them nearly all of Mellicent's and my old summer things--and if little
Tottie didn't go and say afterwards that her mamma did wish Cousin Jane
wouldn't send muslins in December when they hadn't room enough to store
a safety pin.Oh, of course, Mary didn't say that to ME, but she must
have said it somewhere, else Tottie wouldn't have got hold of it.'Children and fools,' you know," she finished meaningly, as she rose to
go.Smith noticed that Miss Maggie seemed troubled that evening, and he
knew that she started off early the next morning and was gone nearly
all day, coming home only for a hurried luncheon.It being Saturday,
the Martin girls were both there to care for Father Duff and the house.Smith suspect that he had learned the
reason for all this.Then a thin-faced young girl with tired eyes came
to tea one evening and was introduced to him as Miss Carrie Davis.Later, when Miss Maggie had gone upstairs to put Father Duff to bed,
Mr.Smith heard Carrie Davis telling Annabelle Martin all about how
kind Miss Maggie had been to Nellie, finding her all that embroidery to
do for that rich Mrs.Gaylord, and how wonderful it was that she had
been able to get such a splendid job for Sam right in Hooper's store
where she was.Smith thought he understood then Miss Maggie's long absence on
Saturday.Smith was often running across little kindnesses that Miss Maggie
had done.He began to think that Miss Maggie must be a very charitable
person--until he ran across several cases that she had not helped.Then
he did not know exactly what to think.His first experience of this kind was when he met an unmistakably
"down-and-out" on the street one day, begging clothing, food, anything,
and telling a sorry tale of his unjust discharge from a local factory.Smith gave the man a dollar, and sent him to Miss Maggie.He
happened to know that Father Duff had discarded an old suit that
morning--and Father Duff and the beggar might have been taken for twins
as to size.On the way home a little later he met the beggar returning,
just as forlorn, and even more hungry-looking."Well, my good fellow, couldn't she fix you up?"She
didn't fix me up ter nothin'--but chin music!"A few days later he heard an eager-eyed young woman begging Miss Maggie
for a contribution to the Pension Fund Fair in behalf of the underpaid
shopgirls in Daly's.Daly's was a Hillerton department Store, notorious
for its unfair treatment of its employees.Miss Maggie seemed interested, and asked many questions.The eager-eyed
young woman became even more eager-eyed, and told Miss Maggie all about
the long hours, the nerve-wearing labor, the low wages--wages upon
which it was impossible for any girl to live decently--wages whose
meagerness sent many a girl to her ruin.Miss Maggie listened attentively, and said, "Yes, yes, I see," several
times.But in the end the eager-eyed young woman went away empty-handed
and sad-eyed.He had thought Miss Maggie was so kind-hearted!She gave to some
fairs--why not to this one?Smith hunted up the
eager-eyed young woman and gave her ten dollars.He would have given
her more, but he had learned from unpleasant experience that large
gifts from unpretentious Mr.John Smith brought comments and curiosity
not always agreeable.It was not until many weeks later that Mr.Smith chanced to hear of the
complete change of policy of Daly's department store.Hours were
shortened, labor lightened, and wages raised.Incidentally he learned
that it had all started from a crusade of women's clubs and church
committees who had "got after old Daly" and threatened all sorts of
publicity and unpleasantness if the wrongs were not righted at once.He
learned also that the leader in the forefront of this movement had
been--Maggie Duff.As it chanced, it was on that same day that a strange man accosted him
on the street."Say, she was all right, she was, old man.I been hopin' I'd see ye
some day ter tell ye.""Ye don't know me, do ye?Well, I do look diff'rent, I'll own.Ye give
me a dollar once, an' sent me to a lady down the street thar.I thought 'twas only
chin-music she was givin' me.She hunted up the
wife an' kids, an' what's more, she went an' faced my boss, an' she got
me my job back, too."Why, I'm--I'm glad, of course!"CHAPTER XV

IN SEARCH OF REST


June brought all the young people home again.It brought, also, a great
deal of talk concerning plans for vacation.Bessie--Elizabeth--said
they must all go away.From James Blaisdell this brought a sudden and vigorous remonstrance."Nonsense, you've just got home!""Hillerton'll be a
vacation to you all right.I
haven't seen a thing of my children for six months."(Elizabeth had learned to give very
silvery laughs.)She shrugged her shoulders daintily and looked at her
rings.You wouldn't really doom us to Hillerton all summer,
daddy.""What isn't the matter with Hillerton?""But I thought we--we would have lovely auto trips," stammered her
mother apologetically."Take them from here, you know, and stay
overnight at hotels around.I've always wanted to do that; and we can
now, dear.""Why, mumsey, we're going to
the shore for July, and to the mountains for August.You and daddy and
I. And Fred's going, too, only he'll be at the Gaylord camp in the
Adirondacks, part of the time."James Blaisdell's eyes, fixed on his son, were
half wistful, half accusing."Well, I sort of had to, governor," he apologized.There are some things a man has to do!Gaylord asked me, and--Hang it
all, I don't see why you have to look at me as if I were committing a
crime, dad!""You aren't, dear, you aren't," fluttered Fred's mother hurriedly; "and
I'm sure it's lovely you've got the chance to go to the Gaylords' camp.And it's right, quite right, that we should travel this summer, as
Bessie--er--Elizabeth suggests.I never thought; but, of course, you
young people don't want to be hived up in Hillerton all summer!""Bet your life we don't, mater," shrugged Fred, carefully avoiding his
father's eyes, "after all that grind."But Fred had turned away, and did not, apparently, hear his father's
grieved question.Smith learned all about the vacation plans a day or two later from
Benny."Yep, we're all goin' away for all summer," he repeated, after he had
told the destination of most of the family."I don't think ma wants to,
much, but she's goin' on account of Bess.Besides, she says everybody
who is anybody always goes away on vacations, of course.They're goin' to the beach first, and I'm goin' to a boys' camp up
in Vermont--Mellicent, she's goin' to a girls' camp."She tried to get Bess to go--Gussie
Pennock's goin'.But Bess!--my you should see her nose go up in the
air!She said she wa'n't goin' where she had to wear great coarse shoes
an' horrid middy-blouses all day, an' build fires an' walk miles an'
eat bugs an' grasshoppers.""Is Miss Mellicent going to do all that?""Bess says she is--I mean, ELIZABETH.We have to call her
that now, when we don't forget it.Have you seen
her since she came back?""She's swingin' an awful lot of style--Bess is.She makes dad dress up
in his swallow-tail every night for dinner.An' she makes him and Fred
an' me stand up the minute she comes into the room, no matter if
there's forty other chairs in sight; an' we have to STAY standin' till
she sits down--an' sometimes she stands up a-purpose, just to keep US
standing.She says a gentleman never sits when a lady
is standin' up in his presence.An' she's lecturin' us all the time on
the way to eat an' talk an' act.Why, we can't even walk natural any
longer.An' she says the way Katy serves our meals is a disgrace to any
civilized family."She got mad an' gave notice on the spot.An' that made ma
'most have hysterics--she did have one of her headaches--'cause good
hired girls are awful scarce, she says.we'll get
some from the city next time that know their business, an' we're goin'
away all summer, anyway, an' won't ma please call them'maids,' as she
ought to, an' not that plebeian 'hired girl.'Everything's 'plebeian' with Bess now.Oh we're havin' great times at
our house since Bess--ELIZABETH--came!"grinned Benny, tossing his cap
in the air, and dancing down the walk much as he had danced the first
night Mr.The James Blaisdells were hardly off to shore and camp when Miss Flora
started on her travels.Smith learned all about her plans, too, for
she came down one day to talk them over with Miss Maggie.Miss Flora was looking very well in a soft gray and white summer silk.Her forehead had lost its lines of care, and her eyes were no longer
peering for wrinkles.panted Miss Flora, as she fluttered up the steps and sank into
one of the porch chairs.Smith was putting
up a trellis for Miss Maggie's new rosebush.He was working faithfully,
but not with the skill of accustomedness.Miss Flora settled back into her chair and
smoothed out the ruffles across her lap."It isn't too gay, is it?You
know the six months are more than up now.""I hoped it wasn't," sighed Miss Flora happily."Well, I'm all packed
but my dresses.""Why, I thought you weren't going till Monday," said Miss Maggie.I suppose I am a little ahead of time.But you see, I
ain't used to packing--not a big trunk, so--and I was so afraid I
wouldn't get it done in time.I was going to put my dresses in; but
Mis' Moore said they'd wrinkle awfully, if I did, and, of course, they
would, when you come to think of it.So I shan't put those in till
Sunday night.I'm so glad Mis' Moore's going.It'll be so nice to have
somebody along that I know.""And she knows everything--all about tickets and checking the baggage,
and all that.You know we're only going to be personally conducted to
Niagara.After that we're going to New York and stay two weeks at some
nice hotel.I want to see Grant's Tomb and the Aquarium, and Mis' Moore
wants to go to Coney Island.She says she's always wanted to go to
Coney Island just as I have to Niagara.""I'm glad you can take her," said Miss Maggie heartily.You know, even if she has such a nice
family, and all, she hasn't much money, and she's been awful nice to me
lately.I used to think she didn't like me, too.But I must have been
mistaken, of course.And 'twas so with Mis' Benson and Mis' Pennock,
too.But now they've invited me there and have come to see me, and are
SO interested in my trip and all.Why, I never knew I had so many
friends, Maggie.Miss Maggie said nothing, but, there was an odd expression on her face.Smith pounded a small nail home with an extra blow of his hammer."And they're all so kind and interested about the money, too," went on
Miss Flora, gently rocking to and fro."Bert Benson sells stocks and
invests money for folks, you know, and Mis' Benson said he'd got some
splendid-payin' ones, and he'd let me have some, and--"

"Flo, you DIDN'T take any of that Benson gold-mine stock!"Smith's hammer stopped, suspended in mid-air.Miss Maggie relaxed in her chair, and Mr.Smith's hammer fell with a
gentle tap on the nail-head."But I felt real bad about it--when Mis'
Benson had been so kind as to offer it, you know.It looked sort of--of
ungrateful, so."Miss Maggie's voice vibrated with indignant scorn."Flora, you won't--you WON'T invest your money without asking Mr.Chalmers's advice first, will you?""But I tell you I didn't," retorted Miss Flora, with unusual sharpness,
for her."But it was good stock, and it pays splendidly."Jane!--but I thought Frank wouldn't let her.""Oh, Frank said all right, if she wanted to, she might.I suspect he
got tired of her teasing, and it did pay splendidly.Why, 'twill pay
twenty-five per cent, probably, this year, Mis' Benson says.You see, he felt he'd got to pacify Jane some way, I s'pose,
she's so cut up about his selling out."Miss Flora
gave the satisfied little wriggle with which a born news-lover always
prefaces her choicest bit of information."Frank has sold his grocery
stores--both of 'em."Why, I should as soon think of his--his selling himself,"
cried Mr."Well, they ain't--because he's separated 'em."Miss Flora was rocking
a little faster now.That he's worked hard all his life, and it's
time he took some comfort.He says he doesn't take a minute of comfort
now 'cause Jane's hounding him all the time to get more money, to get
more money.She's crazy to see the interest mount up, you know--Jane
is.But he says he don't want any more money.He wants to SPEND money
for a while.He's going to retire from
business and enjoy himself."Smith, "this is a piece of news, indeed!""I should say it was," cried Miss Maggie, still almost incredulous."Oh, she's turribly fussed up over it, as you'd know she would be.Such
a good chance wasted, she thinks, when he might be making all that
money earn more.You know Jane wants to turn everything into money now.Honestly, Maggie, I don't believe Jane can look at the moon nowadays
without wishing it was really gold, and she had it to put out to
interest!""Well, it's so," maintained Miss Flora, "So 't ain't any wonder, of
course, that she's upset over this.That's why Frank give in to her, I
think, and let her buy that Benson stock.Besides, he's feeling
especially flush, because he's got the cash the stores brought, too."I'm sorry about that stock," frowned Miss Maggie.Mis' Benson said 'twas," comforted Miss
Flora."When
did this happen--the sale of the store, I mean?"She's ALWAYS hated it that Frank had a grocery store,
you know; and since the money's come, and she's been going with the
Gaylords and the Pennocks, and all that crowd, she's felt worse than
ever.She was saying to me only last week how ashamed she was to think
that her friends might see her own brother-in-law any day wearing
horrid white coat, and selling molasses over the counter.My, but
Hattie'll be tickled all right--or 'Harriet,' I suppose I should say,
but I never can remember it."But what is Frank going to--to do with himself?""Why, Flora, he'll be lost without that grocery store!""Oh, he's going to travel, first.He says he always wanted to, and he's
got a chance now, and he's going to.They're going to the Yellowstone
Park and the Garden of the Gods and to California.And that's another
thing that worries Jane--spending all that money for them just to ride
in the cars.""Oh, yes, she's going, too.She says she's got to go to keep Frank from
spending every cent he's got," laughed Miss Flora."I was over there
last night, and they told me all about it.""Just as soon as they can get ready.Frank's got to help Donovan, the
man that's bought the store, a week till he gets the run of things, he
says.Miss Flora got to
her feet, and smoothed out the folds of her skirt."He's as tickled as
a boy with a new jack-knife.Frank has been a turrible
hard worker all his life.I'm glad he's going to take some comfort,
same as I am."When Miss Flora had gone, Miss Maggie turned to Mr.Smith with eyes
that still carried dazed unbelief."DID Flora say that Frank Blaisdell had sold his grocery stores?"Jane, that he ought not to enjoy his
money, certainly?"He's got money enough to retire, if he wants to, and he's
certainly worked hard enough to earn a rest."But, to me, it's--just this: while he's
got plenty to retire UPON, he hasn't got anything to--to retire TO.""And, pray, what do you mean by that?"Smith, I've known that man from the time he was trading
jack-knives and marbles and selling paper boxes for five pins.I
remember the whipping he got, too, for filching sugar and coffee and
beans from the pantry and opening a grocery store in our barn.From
that time to this, that boy has always been trading SOMETHING.He's
been absolutely uninterested in anything else.I don't believe he's
read a book or a magazine since his school days, unless it had
something to do with business or groceries.He hasn't a sign of a
fad--music, photography, collecting things--nothing.Now, what I want to
know is, what is the man going to do?""Oh, he'll find something," laughed Mr."He's going to travel,
first, anyhow.""Yes, he's going to travel, first.And then--we'll see," smiled Miss
Maggie enigmatically, as Mr.By the middle of July the Blaisdells were all gone from Hillerton and there
remained only their letters for Miss Maggie--and for Mr.Miss
Maggie was very generous with her letters.Smith's
genuine interest, she read him extracts from almost every one that
came.And the letters were always interesting--and usually
characteristic.Benny wrote of swimming and tennis matches, and of "hikes" and the
"bully eats."Hattie wrote of balls and gowns and the attention "dear
Elizabeth" was receiving from some really very nice families who were
said to be fabulously rich.Neither James nor Bessie wrote at all.Mellicent wrote frequently--gay, breezy letters full to the brim of the
joy of living.She wrote of tennis, swimming, camp-fire stories, and
mountain trails: they were like Benny's letters in petticoats, Miss
Maggie said.Long and frequent epistles came from Miss Flora.Miss Flora was having
a beautiful time.Niagara was perfectly lovely--only what a terrible
noise it made!She was glad she did not have to stay and hear it
always.She liked New York, only that was noisy, too, though Mrs.Moore liked Coney Island, too, but Miss
Flora much preferred Grant's Tomb, she said.It was so much more quiet
and ladylike.She thought some things at Coney Island were really not
nice at all, and she was surprised that Mrs.Between the lines it could be seen that in spite of all the good times,
Miss Flora was becoming just the least bit homesick.She wrote Miss
Maggie that it did seem queer to go everywhere, and not see a soul to
bow to.It gave her such a lonesome feeling--such a lot of faces, and
not one familiar one!She had tried to make the acquaintance of several
people--real nice people; she knew they were by the way they looked.But they wouldn't say hardly anything to her, nor answer her questions;
and they always got up and moved away very soon.To be sure, there was one nice young man.He was lovely to them, Miss
Flora said.It was when they were down to
Coney Island.He helped them through the crowds, and told them about
lots of nice things they didn't want to miss seeing.He walked with
them, too, quite awhile, showing them the sights.He was very kind--he
seemed so especially kind, after all those other cold-hearted people,
who didn't care!Moore both lost their
pocketbooks, and had such an awful time getting back to New York.It
was right after they had said good-bye to the nice young gentleman that
they discovered that they had lost them.They were so sorry that they
hadn't found it out before, Miss Flora said, for he would have helped
them, she was sure.But though they looked everywhere for him, they
could not find him at all, and they had to appeal to strangers, who
took them right up to a policeman the first thing, which was very
embarrassing, Miss Flora said.Moore felt as if they
had been arrested, almost!Miss Maggie pursed her lips a little, when
she read this letter to Mr.From Jane, also, came several letters, and from Frank Blaisdell one
short scrawl.Frank said he was having a bully time, but that he'd seen some of the
most shiftless-looking grocery stores that he ever set eyes on.He
asked if Maggie knew how trade was at his old store, and if Donovan was
keeping it up to the mark.He said that Jane was well, only she was
getting pretty tired because she WOULD try to see everything at once,
for fear she'd lose something, and not get her money's worth, for all
the world just as she used to eat things to save them.Jane wrote that she was having a very nice time, of course,--she
couldn't help it, with all those lovely things to see; but she said she
never dreamed that just potatoes, meat, and vegetables could cost so
much anywhere as they did in hotels, and as for the prices those
dining-cars charged--it was robbery--sheer robbery!And why an
able-bodied man should be given ten cents every time he handed you your
own hat, she couldn't understand.Smith passed a very quiet summer, but a very
contented one.He kept enough work ahead to amuse him, but never enough
to drive him.He took frequent day-trips to the surrounding towns, and
when possible he persuaded Miss Maggie to go with him.Miss Maggie was
wonderfully good company.As the summer advanced, however, he did not
see so much of her as he wanted to, for Father Duff's increasing
infirmities made more and more demands on her time.Annabelle was learning the
milliner's trade, and Florence had taken a clerkship for afternoons
during the summer.They still helped about the work, and relieved Miss
Maggie whenever possible.They were sensible, jolly girls, and Mr.CHAPTER XVI

THE FLY IN THE OINTMENT


In August Father Duff died.James
Blaisdell was already in town.She wrote
that she could not think of coming down for the funeral, but she
ordered an expensive wreath.Frank and Jane were in the Far West, and
could not possibly have arrived in time, anyway.Smith helped in every way that he could help, and Miss Maggie told
him that he was a great comfort, and that she did not know what she
would have done without him.James Blaisdell helped,
too, in every way possible, and at last the first hard sad days were
over, and the household had settled back into something like normal
conditions again.Miss Maggie had more time now, and she went often to drive or for motor
rides with Mr.Together they explored cemeteries for miles
around; and although Miss Maggie worried sometimes because they found
so little Blaisdell data, Mr.Smith did not seem to mind it at all.In September Miss Flora moved into an attractive house on the West
Side, bought some new furniture, and installed a maid in the
kitchen--all under Miss Maggie's kindly supervision.In September, too,
Frank and Jane Blaisdell came home, and the young people began to
prepare for the coming school year.Hattie one day, coming out of Miss Maggie's gate.She smiled and greeted him cordially, but she looked so palpably upset
over something that he exclaimed to Miss Maggie, as soon he entered the
house: "What was it?Miss Maggie smiled--but she frowned, too."No, oh, no--except that Hattie has discovered that a hundred thousand
dollars isn't a million.""Oh, where she's been this summer she's measured up, of course, with
people a great deal richer than she.Here in
Hillerton her hundred--and two-hundred-dollar dresses looked very grand
to her, but she's discovered that there are women who pay five hundred
and a thousand, and even more.She feels very cheap and
poverty-stricken now, therefore, in her two-hundred-dollar gowns.If she only would stop trying to live like somebody else!""But I thought--I thought this money was making them happy," stammered
Mr."It was--until she realized that somebody else had more," sighed Miss
Maggie, with a shake of her head."Oh, well, she'll get over that.""At any rate, it's brought her husband some comfort.""Y-yes, it has; but--"

"What do you mean by that?"he demanded, when she did not finish her
sentence."I was wondering--if it would bring him any more.""Oh, no, but they've spent a lot--and Hattie is beginning again her old
talk that she MUST have more money in order to live 'even decent.'It
sounds very familiar to me, and to Jim, I suspect, poor fellow.I saw
him the other night, and from what he said, and what she says, I can
see pretty well how things are going.She's trying to get some of her
rich friends to give Jim a better position, where he'll earn more.She
doesn't understand, either, why Jim can't go into the stock market and
make millions, as some men do.I'm afraid she isn't always--patient.She says there are Fred and Elizabeth and Benjamin to educate, and that
she's just got to have more money to tide them over till the rest of
the legacy comes.""Good Heavens, does that
woman think that--" Mr.Smith stopped with the air of one pulling
himself back from an abyss.It is funny--the way she takes that for
granted, isn't it?Still, there are grounds for it, of course."Do YOU think--she'll get more, then?"To my mind the whole thing was rather
extraordinary, anyway, that he should have given them anything--utter
strangers as they were.Still, as Hattie says, as long as he HAS
recognized their existence, why, he may again of course.Still, on the
other hand, he may have very reasonably argued that, having willed them
a hundred thousand apiece, that was quite enough, and he'd give the
rest somewhere else.""And he may come back alive from South America"

"He may.""But Hattie isn't counting on either of these contingencies, and she is
counting on the money," sighed Miss Maggie, sobering again."And
Jim,--poor Jim!--I'm afraid he's going to find it just as hard to keep
caught up now--as he used to."He stood looking
out of the window, apparently in deep thought.Miss Maggie, with another sigh, turned and went out into the kitchen.The next day, on the street, Mr.She was
with a tall, manly-looking, square-jawed young fellow whom Mr.Mellicent smiled and blushed adorably.Then, to
his surprise, she stopped him with a gesture.Smith, I know it's on the street, but I--I want Mr.Gray to meet
you, and I want you to meet Mr.Smith is--is a very good
friend of mine, Donald."Smith greeted Donald Gray with a warm handshake and a keen glance
into his face.The blush, the hesitation, the shy happiness in
Mellicent's eyes had been unmistakable.Smith felt suddenly that
Donald Gray was a man he very much wanted to know--a good deal about.Then he went home and straight to Miss
Maggie."Well, to begin with, he's devoted to Mellicent.""You don't have to tell me that."What I want to know is, who is he?""He's a young man whom Mellicent met this summer.He plays the violin,
and Mellicent played his accompaniments in a church entertainment.He's the son of a minister near their
camp, where the girls went to church.He's
hard hit--that's sure.He came to Hillerton at once, and has gone to
work in Hammond's real estate office."Yes, I did--but her mother doesn't."She says he's worse than Carl Pennock--that he hasn't got
any money, not ANY money.""You don't mean
that she's really letting money stand in the way if Mellicent cares for
him?Why, it was only a year ago that she herself was bitterly
censuring Mrs.Pennock for doing exactly the same thing in the case of
young Pennock and Mellicent.""But--she seems to have forgotten that.""Shoe's on the other foot this time.""I don't think Jane has done much yet, by way of opposition.You see
they've only reached home, and she's just found out about it.But she
told me she shouldn't let it go on, not for a moment.She has other
plans for Mellicent.""Shall I be--meddling in what isn't my business, if I ask what they
are?""You know I am very much
interested in--Miss Mellicent."Perhaps you can suggest--a way out
for us," sighed Miss Maggie."The case is just this: Jane wants
Mellicent to marry Hibbard Gaylord."I've seen young Gray only once, but I'd give more for his
little finger than I would for a cartload of Gaylords!""But Jane--well, Jane feels
otherwise.To begin with, she's very much flattered at Gaylord's
attentions to Mellicent--the more so because he's left Bessie--I beg
her pardon, 'Elizabeth'--for her.""Then Miss Elizabeth is in it, too?"That's one of the reasons why Hattie is so anxious
for more money.She wants clothes and jewels for Bessie so she can keep
pace with the Gaylords.You see there's a wheel within a wheel here.""As near as I can judge, young Gaylord is Bessie's devoted slave--until
Mellicent arrives; then he has eyes only for HER, which piques Bessie
and her mother not a little.They were together more or less all summer
and I think Hattie thought the match was as good as made.Now, once in
Hillerton, back he flies to Mellicent."I think--no, I KNOW she cares for young
Gray; but--well, I might as well admit it, she is ready any time to
flirt outrageously with Hibbard Gaylord, or--or with anybody else, for
that matter.I saw her flirting with you at the party last Christmas!"Miss Maggie's face showed a sudden pink blush.If she'll flirt with young Gaylord AND
OTHERS, it's all right."But I don't like to have her flirt at all, Mr.It's just her bottled-up childhood and youth
bubbling over.She can't help bubbling, she's been repressed so long.She'll come out all right, and she won't come out hand in hand with
Hibbard Gaylord.She'll be quiet, but
she'll be firm.With one hand she'll keep Gray away, and with the other
she'll push Gaylord forward.Even Mellicent herself won't know how it's
done.But it'll be done, and I tremble for the consequences."Smith's eyes had lost their twinkle now.To himself he
muttered: "I wonder if maybe--I hadn't better take a hand in this thing
myself.""You said--I didn't understand what you said," murmured Miss Maggie
doubtfully."Nothing--nothing, Miss Maggie," replied the man.Then, with
business-like alertness, he lifted his chin."How long do you say this
has been going on?""Why, especially since they all came home two weeks ago.Jane knew
nothing of Donald Gray till then.""Oh, he comes in anywhere that he can find a chance; though, to do her
justice, Mellicent doesn't give him--many chances.""What does her father say to all this?"He says nothing--or, rather, he laughs, and says: 'Oh, well, it will
come out all right in time.He's taken him to ride in his car once, to my
knowledge."Frank Blaisdell has--a car?""Oh, yes, he's just been learning to run it.Jane says he's crazy over
it, and that he's teasing her to go all the time.She says he wants to
be on the move somewhere every minute."Well, no, I--didn't.""Oh yes, he's joined the Hillerton Country Club, and he goes up to the
links every morning for practice.""I can't imagine it--Frank Blaisdell spending his mornings playing
golf!""Frank Blaisdell is a retired
business man.He has begun to take some pleasure in life now."Smith, as he turned to go into his own room.Smith called on the Frank Blaisdells that evening.Blaisdell
took him out to the garage (very lately a barn), and showed him the
shining new car.He also showed him his lavish supply of golf clubs,
and told him what a "bully time" he was having these days.He told him,
too, all about his Western trip, and said there was nothing like travel
to broaden a man's outlook.He said a great deal about how glad he was
to get out of the old grind behind the counter--but in the next breath
he asked Mr.Smith if he had ever seen a store run down as his had done
since he left it.Donovan didn't know any more than a cat how such a
store should be run, he said.When they came back from the garage they found callers in the
living-room.Carl Pennock and Hibbard Gaylord were chatting with
Mellicent.Almost at once the doorbell rang, too, and Donald Gray came
in with his violin and a roll of music.Mellicent's mother came in
also.She greeted all the young men pleasantly, and asked Carl Pennock
to tell Mr.Then she sat down by
young Gray and asked him many questions about his music.She was SO
interested in violins, she said.Gray waxed eloquent, and seemed wonderfully pleased--for about five
minutes; then Mr.Smith saw that his glance was shifting more and more
frequently and more and more unhappily to Mellicent and Hibbard
Gaylord, talking tennis across the room.Smith apparently lost interest in young Pennock's fish story then.At all events, another minute found him eagerly echoing Mrs.Blaisdell's interest in violins--but with this difference: violins in
the abstract with her became A violin in the concrete with him; and he
must hear it at once.Jane herself could not have told exactly how it was done, but she
knew that two minutes later young Gray and Mellicent were at the piano,
he, shining-eyed and happy, drawing a tentative bow across the strings:
she, no less shining-eyed and happy, giving him "A" on the piano.Smith enjoyed the music very much--so much that he begged for
another selection and yet another.Smith did not appear to realize
that Messrs.Pennock and Gaylord were passing through sham interest and
frank boredom to disgusted silence.Jane's efforts to substitute some other form of entertainment for the
violin-playing.He shook hands very heartily, however, with Pennock and
Gaylord when they took their somewhat haughty departure, a little
later, and, strange to say, his interest in the music seemed to go with
their going; for at once then he turned to Mr.Frank Blaisdell
with a very animated account of some Blaisdell data he had found only
the week before.He did not appear to notice that the music of the piano had become
nothing but soft fitful snatches with a great deal of low talk and
laughter between.Blaisdell, and
especially Mrs.Blaisdell, should know the intimate history of one
Ephraim Blaisdell, born in 1720, and his ten children and forty-nine
grandchildren.He talked of various investments then, and of the
weather.He talked of the Blaisdells' trip, and of the cost of railroad
fares and hotel life.Jane told her husband
after he left that Mr.Smith had talked of everything under the sun,
and that she nearly had a fit because she could not get one minute to
herself to break in upon Mellicent and that horrid Gray fellow at the
piano.She had
never remembered he was such a talker!The young people had a tennis match on the school tennis court the next
day.Smith told Miss Maggie that he thought he would drop around
there.He said he liked very much to watch tennis games.Miss Maggie said yes, that she liked to watch tennis games, too.If
this was just a wee bit of a hint, it quite failed of its purpose, for
Mr.Smith did not offer to take her with him.He changed the subject,
indeed, so abruptly, that Miss Maggie bit her lip and flushed a little,
throwing a swift glance into his apparently serene countenance.Miss Maggie herself, in the afternoon, with an errand for an excuse,
walked slowly by the tennis court.Smith at once--but he
did not seem at all interested in the playing.He had his back to the
court, in fact.He was talking very animatedly with Mellicent
Blaisdell.He was still talking with her--though on the opposite side
of the court--when Miss Maggie went by again on her way home.Miss Maggie frowned and said something just under her breath about
"that child--flirting as usual!"Then she went on, walking very fast,
and without another glance toward the tennis ground.But a little
farther on Miss Maggie's step lagged perceptibly, and her head lost its
proud poise.Miss Maggie, for a reason she could not have explained
herself, was feeling suddenly old, and weary, and very much alone.To the image in the mirror as she took off her hat a few minutes later
in her own hall, she said scornfully:

"Well, why shouldn't you feel old?Miss
Maggie had a habit of talking to herself in the mirror--but never
before had she said anything like this to herself.queried Miss Maggie, without looking up
from the stocking she was mending.Why, I don't remember who did win finally," he answered.Nor did it apparently occur to him that for one who was so greatly
interested in tennis, he was curiously uninformed.Smith left the house soon after breakfast, and,
contrary to his usual custom, did not mention where he was going.Miss
Maggie was surprised and displeased.More especially was she displeased
because she WAS displeased.As if it mattered to her where he went, she
told herself scornfully.The next day and the next it was much the same.demanded Jane, without preamble, glancing at the
vacant chair by the table in the corner.Miss Maggie, to her disgust, could feel the color burning in her
cheeks; but she managed to smile as if amused."I don't know, I'm sure."Well, if you were I should ask you to keep him away from Mellicent,"
retorted Mrs."I mean he's been hanging around Mellicent almost every day for a week."Smith is fifty if
he's a day.""I'm not saying he isn't," sniffed Jane, her nose uptilted."But I do
say, 'No fool like an old fool'!"Smith has always been fond
of Mellicent, and--and interested in her.But I don't believe he cares
for her--that way.""Then why does he come to see her and take her auto-riding, and hang
around her every minute he gets a chance?""I know how he
acts at the house, and I hear he scarcely left her side at the tennis
match the other day.""Yes, I--" Miss Maggie did not finish her sentence.A slow change came
to her countenance.The flush receded, leaving her face a bit white."I wonder if the man really thinks he stands any chance," spluttered
Jane, ignoring Miss Maggie's unfinished sentence."Why, he's worse than
that Donald Gray.He not only hasn't got the money, but he's old, as
well.""Yes, we're all--getting old, Jane."Miss Maggie tossed the words off
lightly, and smiled as she uttered them.Jane had gone,
she went to the little mirror above the mantel and gazed at herself
long and fixedly.Then resolutely she turned away, picked up her work,
and fell to sewing very fast.Two days later Mellicent went back to school.To Miss Maggie things seemed to settle back
into their old ways again then.Smith she took drives and
motor-rides, enjoying the crisp October air and the dancing sunlight on
the reds and browns and yellows of the autumnal foliage.True, she used
to wonder sometimes if the end always justified the means--it seemed an
expensive business to hire an automobile to take them fifty miles and
back, and all to verify a single date.And she could not help noticing
that Mr.Smith appeared to have many dates that needed verifying--dates
that were located in very diverse parts of the surrounding country.Miss Maggie also could not help noticing that Mr.Smith was getting
very little new material for his Blaisdell book these days, though he
still worked industriously over the old, retabulating, and recopying.She knew this, because she helped him do it--though she was careful to
let him know that she recognized the names and dates as old
acquaintances.To tell the truth, Miss Maggie did not like to admit, even to herself,
that Mr.Smith must be nearing the end of his task.She did not like to
think of the house--after Mr.She told herself
that he was just the sort of homey boarder that she liked, and she
wished she might keep him indefinitely.She thought so all the more when the long evenings of November brought
a new pleasure; Mr.Smith fell into the way of bringing home books to
read aloud; and she enjoyed that very much.They had long talks, too,
over the books they read.In one there was an old man who fell in love
with a young girl, and married her.Miss Maggie, as certain parts of
this story were read, held her breath, and stole furtive glances into
Mr.When it was finished she contrived to question with
careful casualness, as to his opinion of such a marriage.He said he did not
believe that such a marriage should take place, nor did he believe that
in real life, it would result in happiness.Marriage should be between
persons of similar age, tastes, and habits, he said very decidedly.And
Miss Maggie blushed and said yes, yes, indeed!And that night, when
Miss Maggie gazed at herself in the glass, she looked so happy--that
she appeared to be almost as young as Mellicent herself!CHAPTER XVII

AN AMBASSADOR OF CUPID'S


Christmas again brought all the young people home for the holidays.It
brought, also, a Christmas party at James Blaisdell's home.It was a
very different party, however, from the housewarming of a year before.To begin with, the attendance was much smaller; Mrs.Hattie had been
very exclusive in her invitations this time.She had not invited
"everybody who ever went anywhere."There were champagne, and
cigarettes for the ladies, too.Miss Maggie, who
had not attended any social gathering since Father Duff died, yielded
to Mr.Smith's urgings and said that she would go to this.But Miss
Maggie wished afterward that she had not gone--there were so many, many
features about that party that Miss Maggie did not like.She did not like the champagne nor the cigarettes.She did not like
Bessie's showy, low-cut dress, nor her supercilious airs.She did not
like the look in Fred's eyes, nor the way he drank the champagne.She
did not like Jane's maneuvers to bring Mellicent and Hibbard Gaylord
into each other's company--nor the way Mr.Smith maneuvered to get
Mellicent for himself.Of all these, except the very last, Miss Maggie talked with Mr.Smith
on the way home--yet it was the very last that was uppermost in her
mind, except perhaps, Fred.She did speak of Fred; but because that,
too, was so much to her, she waited until the last before she spoke of
it."You saw Fred, of course," she began then.Short as the word was, it carried a volume of meaning to Miss
Maggie's fearful ears.Smith, it--it isn't true, is it?""You saw him--drinking, then?"I saw some, and I heard--more.He's got in
with Gaylord and the rest of his set at college, and they're a bad
lot--drinking, gambling--no good.""But Fred wouldn't--gamble, Mr.And
he's so ambitious to get ahead!Surely he'd know he couldn't get
anywhere in his studies, if--if he drank and gambled!"I saw him only a minute at the first, and he
didn't look well a bit, to me."I found him in his den just as I did last year.He
didn't look well to me, either.""Not a word--and that's what worries me the most.Last year he talked a
lot about him, and was so proud and happy in his coming success.This
time he never mentioned him; but he looked--bad.""Oh, books, business:--nothing in particular.And he wasn't interested
in what he did say."He's talked with me
quite a lot about--about the way they're living.He doesn't like--so
much fuss and show and society."Hattie would get over all that by this time, after
the newness of the money was worn off."It's worse, if anything," sighed
Miss Maggie, as they ascended the steps at her own door."And Miss Bessie--" he began disapprovingly, then stopped."Now, Miss
Mellicent--" he resumed, in a very different voice.With a rather loud
rattling of the doorknob she was pushing open the door.she cried, hurrying
into the living-room.Smith, hurrying after, evidently forgot to finish his sentence.Miss Maggie did not attend any more of the merrymakings of that holiday
week.It seemed to Miss Maggie, indeed, that Mr.Smith was away nearly every minute of that long week--and it WAS a long
week to Miss Maggie.Even the Martin girls were away many of the
evenings.Miss Maggie told herself that that was why the house seemed
so lonesome.But though Miss Maggie did not participate in the gay doings, she heard
of them.She heard of them on all sides, except from Mr.Smith--and on
all sides she heard of the devotion of Mr.She
concluded that this was the reason why Mr.Smith understood that Mellicent and young
Gray cared for each other, and she had thought that Mr.Smith even
approved of the affair between them.Now to push himself on the scene
in this absurd fashion and try "to cut everybody out," as it was
vulgarly termed--she never would have believed it of Mr.She had considered him to be a man of good sense and good judgment.And
had he not himself said, not so long ago, that he believed lovers
should be of the same age, tastes, and habits?And yet, here now he
was--

And there could be no mistake about it.The Martin girls brought it home as current gossip.Jane was
highly exercised over it, and even Harriet had exclaimed over the
"shameful flirtation Mellicent was carrying on with that man old enough
to be her father!"Besides, did she not see
with her own eyes that Mr.Smith was gone every day and evening, and
that, when he was at home at meal-time, he was silent and preoccupied,
and not like himself at all?And it was such a pity--she had thought so much of Mr.And Miss Maggie looked ill on the last evening of that holiday week
when, at nine o'clock, Mr.Smith found her sitting idle-handed before
the stove in the living-room."Why, Miss Maggie, what's the matter with you?"cried the man, in very
evident concern."You don't look like yourself to-night!"I'm just--tired, I guess.In spite of herself Miss Maggie's voice carried a
tinge of something not quite pleasant.Smith, however, did not appear to notice it."Yes, I'm home early for once, thank Heaven!"he half groaned, as he
dropped himself into a chair."It has been a strenuous week for you, hasn't it?"Again the tinge of
something not quite pleasant in Miss Maggie's voice."Yes, but it's been worth it."There was a
vague questioning in his eyes.Obtaining, apparently, however, no
satisfactory answer from Miss Maggie's placid countenance, he turned
away and began speaking again."Well, anyway, I've accomplished what I set out to do.""You-you've ALREADY accomplished it?"She was
gazing at him now with startled, half-frightened eyes.Why, Miss Maggie, what's the matter?What makes you look so--so
queer?"Why, nothing--nothing at all," laughed Miss Maggie
nervously, but very gayly."I may have been a little--surprised, for a
moment; but I'm very glad--very.""Why, yes, for--for you.Isn't one always glad when--when a love affair
is--is all settled?"Smith smiled pleasantly, but without
embarrassment."It doesn't matter, of course, only--well, I had hoped
it wasn't too conspicuous.""Oh, but you couldn't expect to hide a thing like that, Mr.Smith,"
retorted Miss Maggie, with what was very evidently intended for an arch
smile."Well, I suppose I couldn't expect to keep a thing like that entirely
in the dark.Still, I don't believe the parties themselves--quite
understood.Of course, Pennock and Gaylord knew that they were kept
effectually away, but I don't believe they realized just how
systematically it was done.I--I can't help being sorry for him.""Certainly; and I should think YOU might give him a little sympathy,"
rejoined Miss Maggie spiritedly."You KNOW how much he cared for
Mellicent."Why, what in the world are you talking about?Wasn't I doing the best I could for them all the time?Of COURSE, it
kept HIM away from her, too, just as it did Pennock and Gaylord; but HE
understood.Besides, he HAD her part of the time.I let him in whenever
it was possible.""Whatever in the world
are YOU talking about?Do you mean to say you were doing this FOR Mr.You didn't suppose it
was for Pennock or Gaylord, did you?Nor for--" He stopped short and
stared at Miss Maggie in growing amazement and dismay."You didn't--you
DIDN'T think--I was doing that--for MYSELF?""Well, of course, I--I--" Miss Maggie was laughing and blushing
painfully, but there was a new light in her eyes."Well, anyway,
everybody said you were!"Smith leaped to his feet and thrust his hands
into his pockets, as he took a nervous turn about the room.as if, in my position, I'd--How perfectly absurd!"He
wheeled and faced her irritably.Why, I'm not a
marrying man.I don't like--I never saw the woman yet that I--" With
his eyes on Miss Maggie's flushed, half-averted face, he stopped again
abruptly."Well, I'll be--" Even under his breath he did not finish his
sentence; but, with a new, quite different expression on his face, he
resumed his nervous pacing of the room, throwing now and then a quick
glance at Miss Maggie's still averted face."It WAS absurd, of course, wasn't it?"Miss Maggie stirred and spoke
lightly, with the obvious intention of putting matters back into usual
conditions again."But, come, tell me, just what did you do, and how?I'm so interested--indeed, I am!"Smith spoke as if he was thinking of something else
entirely.Smith sat down, but he did not go on speaking
at once."You said--you kept Pennock and Gaylord away," Miss Maggie hopefully
reminded him.Oh, I--it was really very simple--I just monopolized
Mellicent myself, when I couldn't let Donald have her.I
saw very soon that she couldn't cope with her mother alone.And
Gaylord--well, I've no use for that young gentleman."I've been looking him up for some time.Miss Maggie asked other questions--Miss Maggie was manifestly
interested--and Mr.Very soon he said good-night and went to his own room.Miss Maggie, who still felt
self-conscious and embarrassed over her misconception of his attentions
to Mellicent, was more talkative than usual in her nervous attempt to
appear perfectly natural.The fact that she often found his eyes fixed
thoughtfully upon her, and felt them following her as she moved about
the room, did not tend to make her more at ease.At such times she
talked faster than ever--usually, if possible, about some member of the
Blaisdell family: Miss Maggie had learned that Mr.Smith was always
interested in any bit of news about the Blaisdells.It was on such an occasion that she told him about Miss Flora and the
new house."I don't know, really, what I am going to do with her," she said."I
wonder if perhaps you could help me.""Help you?--about Miss Flora?"Can you think of any way to make her contented?"Why, I thought--Don't tell me SHE isn't happy!"There was a
curious note of almost despair in Mr."Hasn't she a new
house, and everything nice to go with it?""Oh, yes--and that's what's the trouble.She feels
smothered and oppressed--as if she were visiting somewhere, and not at
home.You see, Miss Flora has always
lived very simply.She isn't used to maids--and the maid knows it,
which, if you ever employed maids, you would know is a terrible state
of affairs.""Oh, but she--she'll get used to that, in time.""Perhaps," conceded
Miss Maggie, "but I doubt it.Some women would, but not Miss Flora.She
is too inherently simple in her tastes.'Why, it's as bad as always
living in a hotel!''You know on my trip I
was so afraid always I'd do something that wasn't quite right, before
those awful waiters in the dining-rooms, and I was anticipating so much
getting home where I could act natural--and here I've got one in my own
house!'"She says Hattie is
always telling her what is due her position, and that she must do this
and do that.She's being invited out, too, to the Pennocks' and the
Bensons'; and they're worse than the maid, she declares.She says she
loves to 'run in' and see people, and she loves to go to places and
spend the day with her sewing; but that these things where you go and
stand up and eat off a jiggly plate, and see everybody, and not really
see ANYBODY, are a nuisance and an abomination.""Well, she's about right there," chuckled Mr."Yes, I think she is," smiled Miss Maggie; "but that isn't telling me
how to make her contented."Smith, with an irritability that
was as sudden as it was apparently causeless."I didn't suppose you had
to tell any woman on this earth how to be contented--with a hundred
thousand dollars!""It would seem so, wouldn't it?"Smith's eyes to her face in a
keen glance of interrogation."You mean--you'd like the chance to prove it?That you wish YOU had
that hundred thousand?""Oh, I didn't say--that," twinkled Miss Maggie mischievously, turning
away.Jane Blaisdell on
the street."You're just the man I want to see," she accosted him eagerly."Then I'll turn and walk along with you, if I may," smiled Mr."Well, I don't know as you can do anything," she sighed; "but
somebody's got to do something.Could you--DO you suppose you could
interest my husband in this Blaisdell business of yours?"Smith gave a start, looking curiously disconcerted."Why, I--I thought he
was--er--interested in motoring and golf.""Oh, he was, for a time; but it's too cold for those now, and he got
sick of them, anyway, before it did come cold, just as he does of
everything.Well, yesterday he asked a question--something about Father
Blaisdell's mother; and that gave me the idea.DO you suppose you could
get him interested in this ancestor business?It's so nice and quiet, and it CAN'T cost much--not like golf clubs and
caddies and gasoline, anyway."Why, I--I don't know, Mrs."I--I could show him what I have found, of course.""Well, I wish you would, then.Anyway, SOMETHING'S got to be done," she
sighed.And he
isn't a bit well, either.He ate such a lot of rich food and all sorts
of stuff on our trip that he got his stomach all out of order; and now
he can't eat anything, hardly."Well, if his stomach's knocked out I pity him," nodded Mr.You did say so when you first came,
didn't you?Smith PLEASE, if you know any of those health
fads, don't tell them to my husband.He's tried
dozens of them until I'm nearly wild, and I've lost two hired girls
already.One day it'll be no water, and the next it'll be all he can
drink; and one week he won't eat anything but vegetables, and the next
he won't touch a thing but meat and--is it fruit that goes with meat or
cereals?And lately
he's taken to inspecting every bit of meat and groceries that comes
into the house.Why, he spends half his time in the kitchen, nosing
'round the cupboards and refrigerator; and, of course, NO girl will
stand that!That's why I'm hoping, oh, I AM hoping that you can do
SOMETHING with him on that ancestor business.There, here is the
Bensons', where I've got to stop--and thank you ever so much, Mr."All right, I'll try," promised Mr.Smith dubiously, as he lifted his
hat.But he frowned, and he was still frowning when he met Miss Maggie
at the Duff supper-table half an hour later."Well, I've found another one who wants me to tell how to be contented,
though afflicted with a hundred thousand dollars," he greeted her
gloweringly."Yes.--CAN'T a hundred thousand dollars bring any one satisfaction?"Miss Maggie laughed, then into her eyes came the mischievous twinkle
that Mr."Don't blame the poor money," she said then demurely."Blame--the way
it is spent!"CHAPTER XVIII

JUST A MATTER OF BEGGING


True to his promise, Mr.Frank Blaisdell on "the
ancestor business" very soon.Laboriously he got out his tabulated
dates and names and carefully he traced for him several lines of
descent from remote ancestors.Painstakingly he pointed out a "Submit,"
who had no history but the bare fact of her marriage to one Thomas
Blaisdell, and a "Thankful Marsh," who had eluded his every attempt to
supply her with parents.He let it be understood how important these
missing links were, and he tried to inspire his possible pupil with a
frenzied desire to go out and dig them up.He showed some of the
interesting letters he had received from various Blaisdells far and
near, and he spread before him the genealogical page of his latest
"Transcript," and explained how one might there stumble upon the very
missing link he was looking for.He said he didn't care how
many children his great-grandfather had, nor what they died of; and as
for Mrs.Submit and Miss Thankful, the ladies might bury themselves in
the "Transcript," or hide behind that wall of dates and names till
doomsday, for all he cared.He never did like
figures, he said, except figures that represented something worth
while, like a day's sales or a year's profits.Smith ever seen a store run
down as his old one had since he sold out?For that matter, something
must have got into all the grocery stores; for a poorer lot of goods
than those delivered every day at his home he never saw.It was a
disgrace to the trade.He said a good deal more about his grocery store--but nothing whatever
more about his Blaisdell ancestors; so Mr.Smith felt justified in
considering his efforts to interest Mr.Frank Blaisdell in the ancestor
business a failure.It was in February that a certain metropolitan reporter, short for
feature articles, ran up to Hillerton and contributed to his paper, the
following Sunday, a write-up on "The Blaisdells One Year After,"
enlarging on the fine new homes, the motor cars, and the luxurious
living of the three families.And it was three days after this article
was printed that Miss Flora appeared at Miss Maggie's, breathless with
excitement."Just see what I've got in the mail this morning!"she cried to Miss
Maggie, and to Mr.Smith, who had opened the door for her.With trembling fingers she took from her bag a letter, and a small
picture evidently cut from a newspaper."There, see," she panted, holding them out."It's a man in Boston, and
these are his children.He said he knew I must have a real kind heart, and
he's in terrible trouble.He said he saw in the paper about the
wonderful legacy I'd had, and he told his wife he was going to write to
me, to see if I wouldn't help them--if only a little, it would aid them
that much."Miss Maggie had taken the letter and the
picture rather gingerly in her hands.Smith had gone over to the
stove suddenly--to turn a damper, apparently, though a close observer
might have noticed that he turned it back to its former position almost
at once."He's sick, and he lost his position, and
his wife's sick, and two of the children, and one of 'em's lame, and
another's blind.Oh, it was such a pitiful story, Maggie!Why, some
days they haven't had enough to eat--and just look at me, with all my
chickens and turkeys and more pudding every day than I can stuff down!"He didn't ask me to HIRE him for
anything.""No, no, dear, but I mean--did he give you any references, to show that
he was--was worthy and all right," explained Miss Maggie patiently.He told me himself how
things were with him," rebuked Miss Flora indignantly."It's all in the
letter there."But he really ought to have given you SOME reference, dear, if he
asked you for money.""Well, I don't want any reference.I'd be ashamed to
doubt a man like that!And YOU would, after you read that letter, and
look into those blessed children's faces.Besides, he never thought of
such a thing--I know he didn't.Why, he says right in the letter there
that he never asked for help before, and he was so ashamed that he had
to now."[Illustration with caption: "AND LOOK INTO THOSE BLESSED CHILDREN'S
FACES"]

Mr.Smith made a sudden odd little noise in his throat.At all events, he was seized with a fit of coughing just then.Miss Maggie turned over the letter in her hand."Where does he tell you to send the money?""It's right there--Box four hundred and something; and I got a money
order, just as he said."Do you mean that you've already sent this money?"I stopped at the office on the way down here."He said he would rather have that than a check."You don't seem to have--delayed any."Why, Maggie, he said he HAD to have it at
once.He was going to be turned out--TURNED OUT into the streets!Think
of those seven little children in the streets!Why,
Maggie, what can you be thinking of?""I'm thinking you've been the easy victim of a professional beggar,
Flora," retorted Miss Maggie, with some spirit, handing back the letter
and the picture."Why, Maggie, I never knew you to be so--so unkind," charged Miss
Flora, her eyes tearful."He can't be a professional beggar.He SAID he
wasn't--that he never begged before in his life."Miss Maggie, with a despairing gesture, averted her face.Smith, you--YOU don't think so, do you?"Smith grew very red--perhaps because he had to stop to cough again."Well, Miss Flora, I--I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I shall have to agree
with Miss Maggie here, to some extent."You don't know how beautifully he
talked.""You told me; and you say yourself that he gave you only a post-office
box for an address.So you see you couldn't look him up very well."Miss Flora threw back her head a little haughtily."And I'm glad I don't doubt my fellow men and women as you and Maggie
Duff do!If either of you KNEW what you're talking about, I wouldn't
say anything.You CAN'T KNOW anything about this man,
and you didn't ever get letters like this, either of you, of course.But, anyhow, I don't care if he ain't worthy.I wouldn't let those
children suffer; and I--I'm glad I sent it.I never in my life was so
happy as I was on the way here from the post-office this morning."Without waiting for a reply, she turned away majestically; but at the
door she paused and looked back at Miss Maggie."And let me tell you that, however good or bad this particular man may
be, it's given me an idea, anyway," she choked.The haughtiness was all
gone now "I know now why it hasn't seemed right to be so happy.It's
because there are so many other folks in the world that AREN'T happy.Why, my chicken and turkey would choke me now if I didn't give some of
it to--to all these others.And I'm going to--I'M GOING TO!"she
reiterated, as she fled from the room.As the door shut crisply, Miss Maggie turned and looked at Mr.Smith had crossed again to the stove and was fussing with the
damper.Miss Maggie, after a moment's hesitation, turned and went out
into the kitchen, without speaking.Smith and Miss Maggie saw very little of Miss Flora after this for
some time.They heard of her
generous gifts to families all over town.A turkey was sent to every house on Mill Street, without exception, and
so much candy given to the children that half of them were made ill,
much to the distress of Miss Flora, who, it was said, promptly sent a
physician to undo her work.The Dow family, hard-working and thrifty,
and the Nolans, notorious for their laziness and shiftlessness, each
received a hundred dollars outright.The Whalens, always with both
hands metaphorically outstretched for alms, were loud in their praises
of Miss Flora's great kindness of heart; but the Davises (Mrs.Jane
Blaisdell's impecunious relatives) had very visible difficulty in
making Miss Flora understand that gifts bestowed as she bestowed them
were more welcome unmade.Every day, from one quarter or another, came stories like these to the
ears of Miss Maggie and Mr.Then one day, about a month later, she appeared as before at the Duff
cottage, breathless and agitated; only this time, plainly, she had been
crying."Why, Flora, what in the world is the matter?"cried Miss Maggie, as
she hurried her visitor into a comfortable chair and began to unfasten
her wraps.Oh, he ain't here, is he?"she lamented, with a
disappointed glance toward the vacant chair by the table in the corner."I thought maybe he could help me, some way.I won't go to Frank, or
Jim.They've--they've said so many things.I'll call him,"
comforted Miss Maggie, taking off Miss Flora's veil and hat and
smoothing back her hair."But you don't want him to find you crying
like this, Flora."Yes, yes, I know, but I'm not crying--I mean, I won't any more.And
I'll tell you just as soon as you get Mr.It's only that I've
been--so silly, I suppose.Miss Maggie, still with the disturbed frown between her eyebrows,
summoned Mr.Then together they sat down to hear Miss Flora's
story."It all started, of course, from--from that day I brought the letter
here--from that man in Boston with seven children, you know.""Yes, I remember," encouraged Miss Maggie."Well, I--I did quite a lot of things after that.I was so glad and
happy to discover I could do things for folks.It seemed to--to take
away the wickedness of my having so much, you know; and so I gave food
and money, oh, lots of places here in town--everywhere,'most, that I
could find that anybody needed it."We heard of the many kind things you did, dear."Miss
Maggie had the air of one trying to soothe a grieved child."But they didn't turn out to be kind--all of 'em," quavered Miss Flora.I TRIED to do 'em all right!""I know; but 'tain't those I came to talk about.I got 'em--lots of 'em--after the first one--the one you saw.First I got one, then another and another, till lately I've been
getting 'em every day,'most, and some days two or three at a time.""And they all wanted--money, I suppose," observed Mr.Smith, "for their
sick wives and children, I suppose.""Oh, not for children always--though it was them a good deal.But it
was for different things--and such a lot of them!I never knew there
could be so many kinds of such things.And I was real pleased, at
first,--that I could help, you know, in so many places.""Then you always sent it--the money?"Why, I just had to, the way they wrote; I wanted to, too.They wrote lovely letters, and real interesting ones, too.One man
wanted a warm coat for his little girl, and he told me all about what
hard times they'd had.Another wanted a brace for his poor little
crippled boy, and HE told me things.Why, I never s'posed folks could
have such awful things, and live!One woman just wanted to borrow
twenty dollars while she was so sick.She didn't ask me to give it to
her.Don't you suppose I'd send her that money?And there was a poor blind man--he wanted money to buy
a Bible in raised letters; and of COURSE I wouldn't refuse that!Some
didn't beg; they just wanted to sell things.I bought a diamond ring to
help put a boy through school, and a ruby pin of a man who needed the
money for bread for his children.And there was--oh, there was lots of
'em--too many to tell.""And all from Boston, I presume," murmured Mr."Oh, no,--why, yes, they were, too, most of 'em, when you come to think
of it."No, I haven't finished," moaned Miss Flora, almost crying again."And
now comes the worst of it.As I said, at first I liked it--all these
letters--and I was so glad to help.But they're coming so fast now I
don't know what to do with 'em.And I never saw such a lot of things as
they want--pensions and mortgages, and pianos, and educations, and
wedding dresses, and clothes to be buried in, and--and there were so
many, and--and so queer, some of 'em, that I began to be afraid maybe
they weren't quite honest, all of 'em, and of course I CAN'T send to
such a lot as there are now, anyway, and I was getting so worried.Besides, I got another one of those awful proposals from those dreadful
men that want to marry me.As if I didn't know THAT was for my money!Then to-day, this morning, I--I got the worst of all."From her bag she
took an envelope and drew out a small picture of several children, cut
apparently from a newspaper."Why, no,--yes, it's the one you brought us a month ago, isn't it?"The one I showed you before is in my bureau drawer
at home.But I got it out this morning, when this one came, and
compared them; and they're just exactly alike--EXACTLY!""Oh, he wrote again, then,--wants more money, I suppose," frowned Miss
Maggie.This man's name is Haley, and
that one was Fay.Haley says this is a picture of his children,
and he says that the little girl in the corner is Katy, and she's deaf
and dumb; but Mr.Fay said her name was Rosie, and that she was LAME.And all the others--their names ain't the same, either, and there ain't
any of 'em blind.And, of course, I know now that--that one of those
men is lying to me.Why, they cut them out of the same newspaper;
they've got the same reading on the back!And I--I don't know what to
believe now.And there are all those letters at home that I haven't
answered yet; and they keep coming--why, I just dread to see the
postman turn down our street.I didn't
like his first letter and didn't answer it; and now he says if I don't
send him the money he'll tell everybody everywhere what a stingy
t-tight-wad I am.And another man said he'd come and TAKE it if I
didn't send it; and you KNOW how afraid of burglars I am!Oh what shall
I do, what shall I do?""First, don't you worry another bit,
Miss Flora.Second, just hand those letters over to me--every one of
them.Most rich people have to have secretaries,
you know.""But how'll you know how to answer MY letters?"demanded Miss Flora
dubiously."N-no, not exactly a secretary.But--I've had some experience with
similar letters," observed Mr.I hoped maybe you
could help me some way, but I never thought of that--your answering
'em, I mean.I supposed everybody had to answer their own letters.How'll you know what I want to say?""I shan't be answering what YOU want to say--but what _I_ want to say.In this case, Miss Flora, I exceed the prerogatives of the ordinary
secretary just a bit, you see.But you can count on one thing--I shan't
be spending any money for you.""You won't send them anything, then?"Smith, I want to send some of 'em something!"Of course you do, dear," spoke up Miss Maggie."But you aren't being
either kind or charitable to foster rascally fakes like that," pointing
to the picture in Miss Flora's lap."I'd stake my life on most of 'em," declared Mr."They have all
the earmarks of fakes, all right.""But I was having a beautiful time giving until these horrid letters
began to come.""Flora, do you give because YOU like the sensation of giving, and of
receiving thanks, or because you really want to help somebody?"asked
Miss Maggie, a bit wearily."Why, Maggie Duff, I want to help people, of course," almost wept Miss
Flora."Well, then, suppose you try and give so it will help them, then," said
Miss Maggie."One of the most risky things in the world, to my way of
thinking, is a present of--cash.Y-yes, of course," stammered Mr.Smith, growing
suddenly, for some unapparent reason, very much confused.Smith finished speaking, he threw an oddly nervous glance
into Miss Maggie's face.But Miss Maggie had turned back to Miss Flora."There, dear," she admonished her, "now, you do just as Mr.Just hand over your letters to him for a while, and forget all about
them.He'll tell you how he answers them, of course.But you won't have
to worry about them any more.Besides they'll soon stop coming,--won't
they, Mr.They'll dwindle to a few scattering ones,
anyway,--after I've handled them for a while.""Well, I should like that," sighed Miss Flora."But--can't I give
anything anywhere?""But I would investigate a
little, first, dear.Smith threw a swiftly questioning
glance into Miss Maggie's face."Yes, oh, yes; I believe in--investigation," he said then."And now,
Miss Flora," he added briskly, as Miss Flora reached for her wraps,
"with your kind permission I'll walk home with you and have a look
at--my new job of secretarying."CHAPTER XIX

STILL OTHER FLIES


It was when his duties of secretaryship to Miss Flora had dwindled to
almost infinitesimal proportions that Mr.Smith wished suddenly that he
were serving Miss Maggie in that capacity, so concerned was he over a
letter that had come to Miss Maggie in that morning's mail.He himself had taken it from the letter-carrier's hand and had placed
it on Miss Maggie's little desk.Casually, as he did so, he had noticed
that it bore a name he recognized as that of a Boston law firm; but he
had given it no further thought until later, when, as he sat at his
work in the living-room, he had heard Miss Maggie give a low cry and
had looked up to find her staring at the letter in her hand, her face
going from red to white and back to red again."Why, Miss Maggie, what is it?"As she turned toward him he saw that her eyes were full of tears."Why, it--it's a letter telling me---" She stopped abruptly, her eyes
on his face."Yes, yes, tell me," he begged."Why, you are--CRYING, dear!"Smith, plainly quite unaware of the caressing word he had used, came
nearer, his face aglow with sympathy, his eyes very tender.The red surged once more over Miss Maggie's face.She drew back a
little, though manifestly with embarrassment, not displeasure."It's--nothing, really it's nothing," she stammered."It's just a
letter that--that surprised me.""Oh, well, I--I cry easily sometimes."With hands that shook visibly,
she folded the letter and tucked it into its envelope.Then with a
carelessness that was a little too elaborate, she tossed it into her
open desk.Very plainly, whatever she had meant to do in the first
place, she did not now intend to disclose to Mr."Miss Maggie, please tell me--was it bad news?"Smith thought he detected a break very like a sob in the laugh."But maybe I could--help you," he pleaded."You couldn't--indeed, you couldn't!""Miss Maggie, was it--money matters?"He had his answer in the telltale color that flamed instantly into her
face--but her lips said:--

"It was--nothing--I mean, it was nothing that need concern you."She
hurried away then to the kitchen, and Mr.Smith was left alone to fume
up and down the room and frown savagely at the offending envelope
tiptilted against the ink bottle in Miss Maggie's desk, just as Miss
Maggie's carefully careless hand had thrown it.Miss Maggie had several more letters from the Boston law firm, and Mr.Smith knew it--though he never heard Miss Maggie cry out at any of the
other ones.That they affected her deeply, however, he was certain.Her
very evident efforts to lead him to think that they were of no
consequence would convince him of their real importance to her if
nothing else had done so.He watched her, therefore, covertly,
fearfully, longing to help her, but not daring to offer his services.That the affair had something to do with money matters he was sure.That she would not deny this naturally strengthened him in this belief.He came in time, therefore, to formulate his own opinion: she had lost
money--perhaps a good deal (for her), and she was too proud to let him
or any one else know it.He watched then all the more carefully to see if he could detect any
NEW economies or new deprivations in her daily living.Then, because he
could not discover any such, he worried all the more: if she HAD lost
that money, she ought to economize, certainly.Could she be so foolish
as to carry her desire for secrecy to so absurd a length as to live
just exactly as before when she really could not afford it?Smith requested to have hot water
brought to his room morning and night, for which service he insisted,
in spite of Miss Maggie's remonstrances, on paying three dollars a week
extra.There came a strange man to call one day.He was a member of the Boston
law firm.Smith found out that much, but no more.Miss Maggie was
almost hysterical after his visit.She talked very fast and laughed a
good deal at supper that night; yet her eyes were full of tears nearly
all the time, as Mr."And I suppose she thinks she's hiding it from me--that her heart is
breaking!"Smith savagely to himself, as he watched Miss
Maggie's nervous efforts to avoid meeting his eyes."I vow I'll have it
out of her.I'll have it out--to-morrow!"Smith did not "have it out" with Miss Maggie the following day,
however.Something entirely outside of himself sent his thoughts into a
new channel.He was alone in the Duff living-room, and was idling over his work, at
his table in the corner, when Mrs.Hattie Blaisdell opened the door and
hurried in, wringing her hands.Smith sprang to his feet and hastened toward her."Oh, I don't know--I don't know," moaned the woman, flinging herself
into a chair."There can't anybody do anything, I s'pose; but I've GOT
to have somebody.I can't stay there in that house--I can't--I can't--I
CAN'T!"And you shan't," soothed the man."And she'll
be here soon, I'm sure--Miss Maggie will.But just let me help you off
with your things," he urged, somewhat awkwardly trying to unfasten her
heavy wraps.Impatiently she jerked off the rich fur coat and
tossed it into his arms; then she dropped into the chair again and fell
to wringing her hands."Oh, what shall I do, what shall I do?"Can't I send for--for your husband?"Blaisdell fell to weeping afresh.He's gone--to Fred, you know.""Yes, yes, that's what's the matter.Blaisdell, I'm so sorry!The woman dropped her hands from her face and looked up wildly, half
defiantly.He isn't bad and
wicked, is he?And they can't shut him up if--if we pay it back--all of
it that he took?They won't take my boy--to PRISON?"Smith's face, she began to wring her hands
again.I'll have to tell you--I'll have to," she
moaned."But, my dear woman,--not unless you want to.""I do want to--I do want to!With a visible effort she calmed herself a little and forced
herself to talk more coherently.He wanted seven hundred
dollars and forty-two cents.He said he'd got to have it--if he didn't,
he'd go and KILL himself.He said he'd spent all of his allowance,
every cent, and that's what made him take it--this other money, in the
first place.""You mean--money that didn't belong to him?""Yes; but you mustn't blame him, you mustn't blame him, Mr."Yes; and--Oh, Maggie, Maggie, what shall I do?she
broke off wildly, leaping to her feet as Miss Maggie pushed open the
door and hurried in.Miss Maggie,
white-faced, but with a cheery smile, was throwing off her heavy coat
and her hat.A moment later she came over and took Mrs.Hattie's
trembling hands in both her own."Now, first, tell me all about it,
dear.""Only a little," answered Miss Maggie, gently pushing the other back
into her chair.Jim telephoned him something, just before
he left.She began to wring her hands again, but
Miss Maggie caught and held them firmly."You see, Fred, he was
treasurer of some club, or society, or something; and--and he--he
needed some money to--to pay a man, and he took that--the money that
belonged to the club, you know, and he thought he could pay it back,
little by little.But something happened--I don't know what--a new
treasurer, or something: anyhow, it was going to be found out--that
he'd taken it.It was going to be found out to-morrow, and so he wrote
the letter to his father.But he looked so--oh, I never
saw him look so white and terrible.And I'm so afraid--of what he'll
do--to Fred."Is Jim going to give him the money?"And he's going to give it to him.Oh, they can't shut him
up--they CAN'T send him to prison NOW, can they?"No, they won't send him to prison.If Jim has gone with
the money, Fred will pay it back and nobody will know it.But, Hattie,
Fred DID it, just the same.""And, Hattie, don't you see?Don't you
see where all this is leading?But he isn't going to, any more.He said if his father would help him out of this
scrape, he'd never get into another one, and he'd SHOW him how much he
appreciated it."I'm glad to hear that," cried Miss Maggie."He'll come out all
right, yet."Smith, over at the window, blew his nose
vigorously.Smith had not sat down since Miss Maggie's entrance.He
had crossed to the window, and had stood looking out--at nothing--all
through Mrs."You do think he will, don't you?"Hattie, turning from one
to the other piteously."He said he was ashamed of himself; that this
thing had been an awful lesson to him, and he promised--oh, he promised
lots of things, if Jim would only go up and help him out of this.He'd
never, never have to again.But he will, I know he will, if that
Gaylord fellow stays there.The whole thing was his fault--I know it
was."Why, Hattie, I thought you liked them!"They're mean, stuck-up things, and they snub me awfully.Don't you suppose I know when I'm being snubbed?And that Gaylord
girl--she's just as bad, and she's making my Bessie just like her.I
got Bess into the same school with her, you know, and I was so proud
and happy.Why, my Bess, my own daughter,
actually looks down on us.She's ashamed of her own father and
mother--and she shows it.And it's that Gaylord girl that's done it,
too, I believe.I thought I--I was training my daughter to be a lady--a
real lady; but I never meant to train her to look down on--on her own
mother!""I'm afraid Bessie--needs something of a lesson," commented Miss Maggie
tersely."But Bessie will be older, one of these days, Hattie, and then
she'll--know more.""But that's what I've been trying to teach her--'more,' something more
all the time, Maggie," sighed Mrs."And I've
tried to remember and call her Elizabeth, too.--but I can't.But,
somehow, to-day, nothing seems of any use, any way.And even if she
learns more and more, I don't see as it's going to do any good.I'm not fine enough yet, it seems, for
Mrs.They don't want me among them, and
they show it.And all my old friends are so envious and jealous since
the money came that THEY don't want me, and THEY show it; so I don't
feel comfortable anywhere.""Never mind, dear, just stop trying to live as you think other folks
want you to live, and live as YOU want to, for a while."Hattie smiled faintly, wiped her eyes again, and got to her feet."Well, just try it," smiled Miss Maggie, helping her visitor into the
luxurious fur coat."You've no idea how much more comfort you'll take."Hattie's eyes were wistful, but almost instantly they
showed an alert gleam of anger."Well, anyhow, I'm not going to try to do what those Gaylords do any
longer.And--and you're SURE Fred won't have to go to prison?""I'm very sure," nodded Miss Maggie.You always make
me feel better, Maggie, and you, too, Mr."Now, go home and go to bed, and don't
worry any more or you'll have one of your headaches."As the door closed behind her visitor, Miss Maggie turned and sank into
a chair.She looked worn and white, and utterly weary."I hope she won't meet Frank or Jane anywhere."Do you think they'd blame her--about this
unfortunate affair of Fred's?"I just
came from Frank's, and--"

"Yes?"Something in her face sent a questioning frown to Mr."Do you remember hearing Flora say that Jane had bought a lot of the
Benson gold-mine stock?""Well, Benson has failed; and they've just found out that that
gold-mine stock is worth--about two cents on a dollar."And how much--"

"About forty thousand dollars," said Miss Maggie wearily."Well, I'll be--"

He did not finish his sentence.CHAPTER XX

FRANKENSTEIN: BEING A LETTER FROM JOHN SMITH TO EDWARD D. NORTON,
ATTORNEY AT LAW


DEAR NED:--Wasn't there a story written once about a fellow who created
some sort of a machine man without any soul that raised the very
dickens and all for him?Frank--Frankenstein?--I guess that was it.Well, I've created a Frankenstein creature--and I'm dead up against it
to know what to do with him.Ned, what in Heaven's name am I going to do with Mr.John Smith, let me tell you, is a very healthy, persistent, insistent,
important person, with many kind friends, a definite position in the
world, and no small degree of influence.Worse yet (now prepare for a
stunning blow, Ned!Smith has been so inconsiderate as to fall in
love.And he has fallen in love as absolutely and as
idiotically as if he were twenty-one instead of fifty-two.Now, will
you kindly tell me how Mr.John Smith is going to fade away into
nothingness?And, even if he finds the way to do that, shall he, before
fading, pop the question for Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, or shall he trust
to Mr.Stanley G. Fulton's being able to win for himself the love Mr.Seriously, joking aside, I'm afraid I've made a mess of things, not
only for myself, but for everybody else.I'll spare you rhapsodies, Ned.They say, anyway,
that there's no fool like an old fool.But I will admit that that
future looks very dark to me if I am not to have the companionship of
the little woman, Maggie Duff.Oh, yes, it's "Poor Maggie."As for Miss Maggie herself, perhaps it's
conceited, but I believe she's not entirely indifferent to Mr.Stanley G. Fulton I have my doubts; but,
alas!I have no doubts whatever as to what her opinion will be of Mr.Stanley G. Fulton's masquerading as Mr.Stanley G. Fulton the job he's got on his hands to put himself
right with her, either.But there's one thing he can be sure of, at
least; if she does care for Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton's money that was the bait.you see already I have adopted the Hillerton
vernacular.)But I fear Miss Maggie is indeed "poor" now.She has had
several letters that I don't like the looks of, and a call from a
villainous-looking man from Boston--one of your craft, I believe
(begging your pardon).I think she's lost some money, and I don't
believe she had any extra to lose.She's as proud as Lucifer, however,
and she's determined no one shall find out she's lost any money, so her
laugh is gayer than ever.I can hear
something in her voice that isn't laughter.Ned, what a mess I HAVE made of it!I feel more than ever now
like the boy with his ear to the keyhole.These people are my
friends--or, rather, they are Mr.As for being
mine--who am I, Smith, or Fulton?Will they be Fulton's friends, after
they find he is John Smith?Will they be Smith's friends, even, after
they find he is Fulton?Oh, yes, I can hear you say that it serves me right, and that you
warned me, and that I was deaf to all remonstrances.Now, we'll waste no more time on that.I've acknowledged my error, and my transgression is ever
before me.I built the box, I walked into it, and I deliberately shut
the cover down.I've got to get out--some
way.I can't spend the rest of my natural existence as John Smith,
hunting Blaisdell data--though sometimes I think I'd be willing to, if
it's the only way to stay with Miss Maggie.I tell you, that little
woman can make a home out of--

But I couldn't stay with Miss Maggie.John Smith wouldn't have money
enough to pay his board, to say nothing of inviting Miss Maggie to
board with him, would he?Stanley G. Fulton's last
will and testament on the first day of next November will effectually
cut off Mr.There is no provision in the
will for Mr.I don't think
he'd like that.By the way, I wonder: do you suppose John Smith could
earn--his salt, if he was hard put to it?Very plainly, then, something
has got to be done about getting John Smith to fade away, and Stanley
G. Fulton to appear before next November.And I had thought it would be so easy!Early this summer John Smith was
to pack up his Blaisdell data, bid a pleasant adieu to Hillerton, and
betake himself to South America.In due course, after a short trip to
some obscure Inca city, or down some little-known river, Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton would arrive at some South American hotel from the interior, and
would take immediate passage for the States, reaching Chicago long
before November first.There would be a slight flurry, of course, and a few annoying
interviews and write-ups; but Mr.Stanley G. Fulton always was known to
keep his affairs to himself pretty well, and the matter would soon be
put down as merely another of the multi-millionaire's eccentricities.The whole thing would then be all over, and well over.But--nowhere had
there been taken into consideration the possibilities of--a Maggie
Duff.And now, to me, that same Maggie Duff is the only thing worth
considering--anywhere.And even after all this, I haven't accomplished what I set out to
do--that is, find the future possessor of the Fulton millions (unless
Miss Maggie--bless her!--says "yes."And even then, some one will have
to have them after us).As
conditions are now, I should not want either Frank, or James, or Flora
to have them--not unless the millions could bring them more happiness
than these hundred thousand apiece have brought.Honest, Ned, that miserable money has made more--But, never mind.It's
too long a story to write.I'll tell you when I see you--if I ever do
see you.There's still the possibility, you know, that Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton is lost in darkest South America, and of course John Smith CAN
go to work!I believe I won't sign any name--I haven't got any name--that I feel
really belongs to me now.Still I might--yes, I will sign it

                                        "FRANKENSTEIN."CHAPTER XXI

SYMPATHIES MISPLACED


The first time Mr.Smith saw Frank Blaisdell, after Miss Maggie's news
of the forty-thousand-dollar loss, he tried, somewhat awkwardly, to
express his interest and sympathy.But Frank Blaisdell cut him short."That's all right, and I thank you," he cried heartily."And I know
most folks would think losing forty thousand dollars was about as bad
as it could be.Jane, now, is all worked up over it; can't sleep
nights, and has gone back to turning down the gas and eating sour cream
so's to save and help make it up.But me--I call it the best thing that
ever happened."Smith; "I'm sure that's a very delightful
way to look at it--if you can.""Well, I can; and I'll tell you why.It's put me back where I
belong--behind the counter of a grocery store.Oh, I had enough left for that, and more!Gorry, but I was glad to feel the old floor under my feet again!""But I thought you--you were tired of work, and--wanted to enjoy
yourself," stammered Mr."Tired of work--wanted to enjoy myself, indeed!Yes, I know I did say
something like that.But, let me tell you this, Mr.Talk about
work!--I never worked so hard in my life as I have the last ten months
trying to enjoy myself.How these folks can stand gadding 'round the
country week in and week out, feeding their stomachs on a French
dictionary instead of good United States meat and potatoes and squash,
and spending their days traipsing off to see things they ain't a mite
interested in, and their nights trying to get rested so they can go and
see some more the next day, I don't understand.""I'm afraid these touring agencies wouldn't like to have you write
their ads for them, Mr."Well, they hadn't better ask me to," smiled the other grimly.Since I come back I've been working even harder trying
to enjoy myself here at home--knockin' silly little balls over a
ten-acre lot in a game a healthy ten-year-old boy would scorn to play.""Oh, yes, I enjoyed the riding well enough; but I didn't enjoy hunting
for punctures, putting on new tires, or burrowing into the inside of
the critter to find out why she didn't go!And that's what I was doing
most of the time.He paused a moment, then went on a little wistfully:--

"I suspect, Mr.Smith, there ain't anything in my line but groceries.If--if I had my life to
live over again, I'd do different, maybe.I'd see if I couldn't find
out what there was in a picture to make folks stand and stare at it an
hour at a time when you could see the whole thing in a minute--and it
wa'n't worth lookin' at, anyway, even for a minute.Now, I like a good tune what is a tune; but them caterwaulings and
dirges that that chap Gray plays on that fiddle of his--gorry, Mr.Smith, I'd rather hear the old barn door at home squeak any day.But if
I was younger I'd try to learn to like 'em.She can set by the hour in front of that phonygraph of hers, and
not know it!""And there's books, too," resumed the other, still wistfully."I'd read
books--if I could stay awake long enough to do it--and I'd find out
what there was in 'em to make a good sensible man like Jim Blaisdell
daft over 'em--and Maggie Duff, too.Why, that little woman used to go
hungry sometimes, when she was a girl, so she could buy a book she
wanted.Why, I'd 'a' given anything this last year if I
could 'a' got interested--really interested, readin'.I could 'a'
killed an awful lot of time that way.I bought a
lot of 'em, too, an' tried it; but I expect I didn't begin young
enough.Smith, I've about come to the conclusion that
there ain't a thing in the world so hard to kill as time.I've tried
it, and I know.Why, I got so I couldn't even kill it EATIN'--though I
'most killed myself TRYIN' to!A full
stomach ain't in it with bein' hungry an' knowing a good dinner's
coming.Why, there was whole weeks at a time back there that I didn't
know the meaning of the word 'hungry.'You'd oughter seen the jolt I
give one o' them waiter-chaps one day when he comes up with his paper
and his pencil and asks me what I wanted.'There ain't
but one thing on this earth I want, and you can't give it to me.I'm tired of bein' so blamed satisfied all the
time!'""And what did--Alphonso say to that?"Oh, the waiter-fellow, you mean?Oh, he just stared a
minute, then mumbled his usual 'Yes, sir, very good, sir,' and shoved
that confounded printed card of his a little nearer to my nose.I guess you've heard enough of this, Mr.It's only that I
was trying to tell you why I'm actually glad we lost that money.It's
give me back my man's job again."I won't waste any more sympathy on you,"
laughed Mr.I hope it'll give me
back a little of my old faith in my fellow-man."I won't suspect every man, woman, and child that says a
civil word to me now of having designs on my pocketbook.Smith, you wouldn't believe it, if I told you, the things that's been
done and said to get a little money out of me.Of course, the open
gold-brick schemes I knew enough to dodge,'most of 'em (unless you
count in that darn Benson mining stock), and I spotted the blackmailers
all right, most generally.But I WAS flabbergasted when a WOMAN tackled
the job and began to make love to me--actually make love to me!--one
day when Jane's back was turned.DO I look such a fool as that,
Mr.Well, anyhow, there won't be any more of that kind, nor
anybody after my money now, I guess," he finished with a sage wag of
his head as he turned away.Smith said, after recounting the
earlier portion of the conversation: "So you see you were right, after
all.Frank Blaisdell had plenty to
retire upon, but nothing to retire to.But I'm glad--if he's happy now.""And he isn't the only one that that forty-thousand-dollar loss has
done a good turn to," nodded Miss Maggie."Mellicent has just been
here.It's the Easter vacation,
anyway, but she isn't going back.Miss Maggie spoke with studied casualness, but there was an added color
in her cheeks--Miss Maggie always flushed a little when she mentioned
Mellicent's name to Mr.Smith, in spite of her indignant efforts not to
do so.Well, the Pennocks had a dance last night, and Mellicent went.She said she had to laugh to see Mrs.Pennock's efforts to keep Carl
away from her--the loss of the money is known everywhere now, and has
been greatly exaggerated, I've heard.She said that even Hibbard
Gaylord had the air of one trying to let her down easy.Mellicent was
immensely amused."He doesn't move in the Pennock crowd much.But
Mellicent sees him, and--and everything's all right there, now.That's
why Mellicent is so happy.""You mean--Has her mother given in?"You see, Jane was at the dance, too, and she saw Carl, and she
saw Hibbard Gaylord.She told Mellicent this
morning that she had her opinion of fellows who would show so plainly
as Carl Pennock and Hibbard Gaylord did that it was the money they were
after."Jane has changed her shoes again," murmured Mr.Miss Maggie's puzzled frown gave way to a laugh."Well, yes, perhaps the shoe is on the other foot again.But, anyway,
she doesn't love Carl or Hibbard any more, and she does love Donald
Gray.He HASN'T let the loss of the money make any difference to him,
you see.He's been even more devoted, if anything.She told Mellicent
this morning that he was a very estimable young man, and she liked him
very much.Perhaps you see now why Mellicent is--happy."I'm glad to know it," cried Mr."I'm glad--" His
face changed suddenly."I'm glad the LOSS of the
money brought them some happiness--if the possession of it didn't," he
finished moodily, turning to go to his own room.At the hall door he
paused and looked back at Miss Maggie, standing by the table, gazing
after him with troubled eyes."Did Mellicent say--whether Fred was
there?"He didn't come home for this vacation
at all.I suspect Mellicent doesn't know
anything about that wretched affair of his."So the young gentleman didn't show up at all?"Hattie didn't
go to the Pennocks' either.Hattie has--has been very different since
this affair of Fred's.I think it frightened her terribly--it was so
near a tragedy; the boy threatened to kill himself, you know, if his
father didn't help him out.""Yes, I know he did; and I'm afraid he found things in a pretty bad
mess--when he got there," sighed Miss Maggie."It was a bad mess all
around.""It is, indeed, a bad mess all around," he growled as he
disappeared through the door.Behind him, Miss Maggie still stood motionless, looking after him with
troubled eyes.As the spring days grew warmer, Miss Maggie had occasion many times to
look after Mr.One day he would be the old delightful companion, genial,
cheery, generously donating a box of chocolates to the center-table
bonbon dish or a dozen hothouse roses to the mantel vase.The next, he
would be nervous, abstracted, almost irritable.Yet she could see no
possible reason for the change.Sometimes she wondered fearfully if Mellicent could have anything to do
with it.Was it possible that he had cared for Mellicent, and to see
her now so happy with Donald Gray was more than he could bear?There was his own statement that he had devoted
himself to her solely and only to help keep the undesirable lovers away
and give Donald Gray a chance.Besides, had he not said that he was not a marrying man, anyway?To be
sure, that seemed a pity--a man so kind and thoughtful and so
delightfully companionable!But then, it was nothing to her, of
course--only she did hope he was not feeling unhappy over Mellicent!Smith would not bring flowers and
candy so often.She felt as if he were spending too
much money--and she had got the impression in some way that he did not
have any too much money to spend.And there were the expensive motor
trips, too--she feared Mr.Yet she could not
tell him so, of course.He never seemed to realize the value of a
dollar, anyway, and he very obviously did not know how to get the most
out of it.Look at his foolish generosity in regard to the board he
paid her!Miss Maggie wondered sometimes if it might not be worry over money
matters that was making him so nervous and irritable on occasions now.Plainly he was very near the end of his work there in Hillerton.He was
not getting so many letters on Blaisdell matters from away, either.For
a month now he had done nothing but a useless repetition of old work;
and of late, a good deal of the time, he was not even making that
pretense of being busy.For days at a time he would not touch his
records.That could mean but one thing, of course; his work was done.Yet he seemed to be making no move toward departure.Not that she
wanted him to go.She should miss him very much when he went, of
course.But she did not like to feel that he was staying simply because
he had nowhere to go and nothing to do.Miss Maggie did not believe in
able-bodied men who had nowhere to go and nothing to do--and she wanted
very much to believe in Mr.She had been under the impression that he was getting the Blaisdell
material together for a book, and that he was intending to publish it
himself.His book must be ready, but he was making no move to
publish it.To Miss Maggie this could mean but one thing: some
financial reverses had made it impossible for him to carry out his
plans, and had left him stranded with no definite aim for the future.She was so sorry!--but there seemed to be nothing that she could do.She HAD tried to help by insisting that he pay less for his board; but
he had not only scouted that idea, but had brought her more chocolates
and flowers than ever--for all the world as if he had divined her
suspicions and wished to disprove them.Smith was trying to keep something from her, Miss Maggie was
sure.She was the more sure, perhaps, because she herself had something
that she was trying to keep from Mr.Smith--and she thought she
recognized the symptoms.Meanwhile April budded into May, and May blossomed into June; and June
brought all the Blaisdells together again in Hillerton.CHAPTER XXII

WITH EVERY JIM A JAMES


Two days after Fred Blaisdell had returned from college, his mother
came to see Miss Maggie.Smith was rearranging the books on Miss
Maggie's shelves and trying to make room for the new ones he had
brought her through the winter.Hattie came in, red-eyed and
flushed-faced, he ceased his work at once and would have left the room,
but she stopped him with a gesture.You know all about it, anyway,--and I'd just as soon you
knew the rest.I just came down to talk
things over with Maggie.I--I'm sure I don't know w-what I'm going to
do--when I can't.""But you always can, dear," soothed Miss Maggie cheerily, handing her
visitor a fan and taking a chair near her.Smith, after a moment's hesitation, turned quietly back to his
bookshelves."Why, Hattie Blaisdell, where are you going?"I
guess we can still see each other.Now, tell me, what does all this
mean?""Well, of course, it began with Fred--his trouble, you know.""But I thought Jim fixed that all up, dear."He paid the money, and nobody there at college knew a
thing about it.Fred told us some of them
night before last.He says he's ashamed of himself, but that he
believes there's enough left in him to make a man of him yet.But he
says he can't do it--there.""You mean--he doesn't want to go back to college?"Miss Maggie's voice
showed her disappointment."Oh, he wants to go to college--but not there.""He says he's had too much money to spend--and that 't wouldn't be easy
not to spend it--if he was back there, in the old crowd."Well, that's all right, isn't it?"He's awfully happy over it, and--and I
guess I am."But now, what is this about Plainville?""Oh, that
grew out of it--all this.Hammond is going to open a new office in
Plainville and he's offered Jim--James--no, JIM--I'm not going to call
him 'James' any more!--the chance to manage it.""Well, that's fine, I'm sure.""Yes, of course that part is fine--splendid.He'll get a bigger salary,
and all that, and--and I guess I'm glad to go, anyway--I don't like
Hillerton any more.I haven't got any friends here, Maggie.Of course,
I wouldn't have anything to do with the Gaylords now, after what's
happened,--that boy getting my boy to drink and gamble, and--and
everything.And yet--YOU know how I've strained every nerve for years,
and worked and worked to get where my children could--COULD be with
them!""It didn't pay, did it, Hattie?"They're perfectly horrid--every one of them, and I
hate them!"Look at what they've done to Fred, and Bessie, too!I
shan't let HER be with them any more, either.There aren't any folks
here we can be with now.That's why I don't mind going away.All our
friends that we used to know don't like us any more, they're so jealous
on account of the money.Oh, yes, I know you think I'm to blame for
that," she went on aggrievedly."I can see you do, by your face.But it was just so I could get ahead.Miss Maggie looked as if she would like to say
something more--but she did not say it.Smith was abstractedly opening and shutting
the book in his hand.He had not
touched the books on the shelves for some time."And look at how I've tried and see what it has come to--Bessie so
high-headed and airy she makes fun of us, and Fred a gambler and a
drunkard, and'most a thief.And it's all that horrid hundred thousand
dollars!"Smith's hand slipped to the floor with a bang; but no
one was noticing Mr."Oh, Hattie, don't blame the hundred thousand dollars," cried Miss
Maggie."Jim says it was, and Fred does, too.Fred said it
was all just the same kind of a way that I'd tried to make folks call
Jim 'James.'He said I'd been trying to make every single 'Jim' we had
into a 'James,' until I'd taken away all the fun of living.And I
suppose maybe he's right, too.""Well,
anyhow, I'm not going to do it any more.There isn't any fun in it,
anyway.It doesn't make any difference how hard I tried to get ahead, I
always found somebody else a little 'aheader' as Benny calls it."There isn't any use--in that kind of trying, Hattie."Jim said I was like the little boy that
they asked what would make him the happiest of anything in the world,
and he answered, 'Everything that I haven't got.'And I suppose I have
been something like that.But I don't see as I'm any worse than other
folks.Everybody goes for money; but I'm sure I don't see why--if it
doesn't make them any happier than it has me!"We shall begin to pack the first of the
month.It looks like a mountain to me, but Jim and Fred say they'll
help, and--"

Mr.Smith did not hear any more, for Miss Maggie and her guest had
reached the hall and had closed the door behind them.But when Miss
Maggie returned, Mr.Smith was pacing up and down the room nervously."Well," he demanded with visible irritation, as soon as she appeared,
"will you kindly tell me if there is anything--desirable--that that
confounded money has done?""You mean--Jim Blaisdell's money?""I mean all the money--I mean the three hundred thousand dollars that
those three people received.Has it ever brought any good or
happiness--anywhere?""Oh, yes, I know," smiled Miss Maggie, a little sadly."But--" Her
countenance changed abruptly.A passionate earnestness came to her
eyes."Don't blame the money--blame the SPENDING of it!The dollar that will buy tickets to the movies will just as
quickly buy a good book; and if you're hungry, it's up to you whether
you put your money into chocolate eclairs or roast beef.Is the MONEY
to blame that goes for a whiskey bill or a gambling debt instead of for
shoes and stockings for the family?"Smith had apparently lost his own irritation in his
amazement at hers."Why, Miss Maggie, you--you seem worked up over this
matter."It's been money,
money, money, ever since I could remember!We're all after it, and we
all want it, and we strain every nerve to get it.We think it's going
to bring us happiness.But it won't--unless we do our part.And there
are some things that even money can't buy.Besides, it isn't the money
that does the things, anyway,--it's the man behind the money.What do
you think money is good for, Mr.Smith, now thoroughly dazed, actually blinked his eyes at the
question, and at the vehemence with which it was hurled into his face."Why, Miss Maggie, it--it--I--I--"

"It isn't good for anything unless we can exchange it for something we
want, is it?""Why, I--I suppose we can GIVE it--"

"But even then we're exchanging it for something we want, aren't we?We
want to make the other fellow happy, don't we?""But it doesn't
always work that way.Now, very likely
this--er--Mr.Fulton thought those three hundred thousand dollars were
going to make these people happy.Personification of happiness--that
woman was, a few minutes ago, wasn't she?"Smith had regained his
air of aggrieved irritation.She
didn't know how to spend it.And that's just what I mean when I say
we've got to do our part--money won't buy happiness, unless we exchange
it for the things that will bring happiness.If we don't know how to
get any happiness out of five dollars, we won't know how to get it out
of five hundred, or five thousand, or five hundred thousand, Mr.I don't mean that we'll get the same amount out of five dollars, of
course,--though I've seen even that happen sometimes!--but I mean that
we've got to know how to spend five dollars--and to make the most of
it.""I reckon--you're right, Miss Maggie.""I know I'm right, and 't isn't the money's fault when things go wrong.Oh, yes, I know--we're taught that the
love of money is the root of all evil.But I don't think it should be
so--necessarily.I think money's one of the most wonderful things in
the world.It's more than a trust and a gift--it's an opportunity, and
a test.It brings out what's strongest in us, every time.And it does
that whether it's five dollars or five hundred thousand dollars.If--if
we love chocolate eclairs and the movies better than roast beef and
good books, we're going to buy them, whether they're chocolate eclairs
and movies on five dollars, or or--champagne suppers and Paris gowns on
five hundred thousand dollars!"Miss Maggie gave a shamefaced laugh and sank back in her chair."You don't know what to think of me, of course; and no wonder," she
sighed."But I've felt so bad over this--this money business right here
under my eyes.I love them all, every one of them.And YOU know how
it's been, Mr.Hasn't it worked out to prove just what I say?She said that Fred declared she'd been
trying to make every one of her 'Jims' a 'James,' ever since the money
came.But he forgot that she did that very same thing before it came.All her life she's been trying to make five dollars look like ten; so
when she got the hundred thousand, it wasn't six months before she was
trying to make that look like two hundred thousand."Jane used to buy ingrain carpets and cheap
chairs and cover them with mats and tidies to save them.""They got on your nerves, too, didn't they?Such layers upon layers of
covers for everything!It brought me to such a pass that I went to the
other extreme.I wouldn't protect ANYTHING--which was very
reprehensible, of course.Well, now she has pretty dishes and solid
silver--but she hides them in bags and boxes, and never uses them
except for company.She doesn't take any more comfort with them than
she did with the ingrain carpets and cheap chairs.Of course, that's a
little thing.When you can't spend five
cents out of a hundred dollars for pleasure without wincing, you
needn't expect you're going to spend five dollars out of a hundred
thousand without feeling the pinch," laughed Miss Maggie."Poor Flora--and when she tried so hard to quiet her conscience because
she had so much money!She told me yesterday that she
hardly ever gets a begging letter now.""No; and those she does get she investigates," asserted Mr."So
the fakes don't bother her much these days.And she's doing a lot of
good, too, in a small way.""She is, and she's happy now," declared Miss Maggie, "except that she
still worries a little because she is so happy.She's dismissed the
maid and does her own work--I'm afraid Miss Flora never was cut out for
a fine-lady life of leisure, and she loves to putter in the kitchen.She says it's such a relief, too, not to keep dressed up in company
manners all the time, and not to have that horrid girl spying 'round
all day to see if she behaves proper.and I reckon it worked the best with her of any of them.""Er--that is, I mean, perhaps she's made the best use of the hundred
thousand," stammered Mr."She's been--er--the happiest.""Why, y-yes, perhaps she has, when you come to look at it that way.""But you wouldn't--er--advise this Mr.Fulton to leave her--his twenty
millions?"laughed Miss Maggie, throwing up both hands."She'd faint dead
away at the mere thought of it."Smith turned on his heel and resumed
his restless pacing up and down the room.From time to time he glanced
furtively at Miss Maggie.Miss Maggie, her hands idly resting in her
lap, palms upward, was gazing fixedly at nothing.he demanded at last, coming to a
pause at her side.Stanley G. Fulton," she answered, not looking
up.The odd something had increased, but Miss Maggie's eyes
were still dreamily fixed on space.I was wondering what he had done with them.""Yes, in the letter, I mean."There was a letter--a second letter to be opened
in two years' time.They said that that was to dispose of the remainder
of the property--his last will and testament.""Oh, yes, I remember," assented Mr.Smith was very carefully not
meeting Miss Maggie's eyes.Miss Maggie turned back to her meditative
gazing at nothing."The two years are nearly up, you know,--I was
talking with Jane the other day--just next November."The words were very near a groan, but at once Mr.Smith
hurriedly repeated, "I know--I know!"very lightly, indeed, with an
apprehensive glance at Miss Maggie."So it seems to me if he were alive that he'd be back by this time.And
so I was wondering--about those millions," she went on musingly."What
do YOU suppose he has done with them?"she asked, with sudden
animation, turning full upon him."Why, I--I--How should I know?"Smith, a swift crimson
dyeing his face."You wouldn't, of course--but that needn't make you look as if I'd
intimated that YOU had them!I was only asking for your opinion, Mr.Smith," she twinkled, with mischievous eyes.Smith laughed now, a little precipitately."But,
indeed, Miss Maggie, you turned so suddenly and the question was so
unexpected that I felt like the small boy who, being always blamed for
everything at home that went wrong, answered tremblingly, when the
teacher sharply demanded, 'Who made the world?''Please, ma'am, I did;
but I'll never do it again!'"Smith, when Miss Maggie had done laughing at his
little story, "suppose I turn the tables on you?Miss Maggie shifted her position, her
face growing intently interested again."I've been trying to remember
what I know of the man.""Yes, from the newspaper and magazine accounts of him.Of course, there
was quite a lot about him at the time the money came; and Flora let me
read some things she'd saved, in years gone.Flora was always
interested in him, you know.""Why, not much, really, about the man.Besides, very likely what I did
find wasn't true.But
I was trying to find out how he'd spent his money himself.John went back to the hallway.I thought
that might give me a clue--about the will, I mean.""Yes; but I didn't find much.In spite of his reported eccentricities,
he seems to me to have done nothing very extraordinary.""He doesn't seem to have been very bad.""Nor very good either, for that matter.""Sort of a--nonentity, perhaps.""Perhaps--though I suppose he couldn't really be that--not very
well--with twenty millions, could he?But I mean, he wasn't very bad,
nor very good.He didn't seem to be dissipated, or mixed up in any
scandal, or to be recklessly extravagant, like so many rich men.On the
other hand, I couldn't find that he'd done any particular good in the
world.Some charities were mentioned, but they were perfunctory,
apparently, and I don't believe, from the accounts, that he ever really
INTERESTED himself in any one--that he ever really cared for--any one."If Miss Maggie had looked up, she would have met a
most disconcerting expression in the eyes bent upon her.But Miss
Maggie did not look up."Why, he didn't even have a wife and
children to stir him from his selfishness.He had a secretary, of
course, and he probably never saw half his begging letters.I can
imagine his tossing them aside with a languid 'Fix them up,
James,--give the creatures what they want, only don't bother me.'"Smith; then, hastily: "I'm sure he never
did."But when I think of what he might
do--Twenty millions!But he didn't
do--anything--worth while with them, so far as I can see, when he was
living, so that's why I can't imagine what his will may be.Probably
the same old perfunctory charities, however, with the Chicago law firm
instead of 'James' as disburser--unless, of course, Hattie's
expectations are fulfilled, and he divides them among the Blaisdells
here.""You think--there's something worth while he MIGHT have done with those
millions, then?"Smith, a sudden peculiar wistfulness in
his eyes."Something he MIGHT have done with them!""Why,
it seems to me there's no end to what he might have done--with twenty
millions."Smith came nearer, his face working with emotion."Miss
Maggie, if a man with twenty millions--that is, could you love a man
with twenty millions, if--if Mr.Fulton should ask you--if _I_ were Mr.Fulton--if--" His countenance changed suddenly.He drew himself up with
a cry of dismay."Oh, no--no--I've spoiled it all now.That isn't what
I meant to say first.I was going to find out--I mean, I was going to
tell--Oh, good Heavens, what a--That confounded money--again!"Smith, w-what--" Only the crisp shutting of the door answered
her.With a beseeching look and a despairing gesture Mr.Then, turning to sit down, she came face to face with her own
image in the mirror."Well, now you've done it, Maggie Duff," she whispered wrathfully to
the reflection in the glass.He was--was
going to say something--I know he was.You've talked money,
money, MONEY to him for an hour.You said you LOVED money; and you told
what you'd do--if you had twenty millions of dollars.And you know--you
KNOW he's as poor as Job's turkey, and that just now he's more than
ever plagued over--money!As
if that counted against--"

With a little sobbing cry Miss Maggie covered her face with her hands
and sat down, helplessly, angrily.CHAPTER XXIII

REFLECTIONS--MIRRORED AND OTHERWISE


Miss Maggie was still sitting in the big chair with her face in her
hands when the door opened and Mr.Miss Maggie, dropping her hands and starting up at his entrance, caught
a glimpse of his face in the mirror in front of her.With a furtive,
angry dab of her fingers at her wet eyes, she fell to rearranging the
vases and photographs on the mantel."Miss Maggie, I've got to face this thing out, of course.Even if I
had--made a botch of things at the very start, it didn't help any
to--to run away, as I did.It was only
because I--I--But never mind that.I'm coming now straight to the
point.Miss Maggie, will you--marry me?"The photograph in Miss Maggie's hand fell face down on the shelf.Miss
Maggie's fingers caught the edge of the mantel in a convulsive grip.A
swift glance in the mirror before her disclosed Mr.Smith's face just
over her shoulder, earnest, pleading, and still very white.She dropped
her gaze, and turned half away.She tried to speak, but only a half-choking little
breath came."Miss Maggie, please don't say no--yet.Let me--explain--about how I
came here, and all that.But first, before I do that, let me tell you
how--how I love you--how I have loved you all these long months.I
THINK I loved you from the first time I saw you.Whatever comes, I want
you to know that.And if you could care for me a little--just a little,
I'm sure I could make it more--in time, so you would marry me.Don't you believe I'd try to make you happy--dear?""Yes, oh, yes," murmured Miss Maggie, still with her head turned away.Then all you've got to say is that you'll let me try.Why, until I came here to this little house, I
didn't know what living, real living, was.And I HAVE been, just as
you said, a selfish old thing."Miss Maggie, with a start of surprise, faced the image in the mirror;
but Mr.Smith was looking at her, not at her reflection, so she did not
meet his ayes."Why, I never--" she stammered."Yes, you did, a minute ago.Oh, of course you
didn't realize--everything, and perhaps you wouldn't have said it if
you'd known.But you said it--and you meant it, and I'm glad you said
it.And, dear little woman, don't you see?That's only another reason
why you should say yes.You can show me how not to be selfish."Smith, I--I-" stammered Miss Maggie, still with puzzled eyes.You can show me how to make life really worth while, for
me, and for--for lots of others And NOW I have some one to care for.And, oh, little woman, I--I care so much, it can't be that you--you
don't care--any!"Miss Maggie caught her breath and turned away again.The red crept up Miss Maggie's neck to her forehead but still she was
silent."If I could only see your eyes," pleaded the man.Then, suddenly, he
saw Miss Maggie's face in the mirror.The next moment Miss Maggie
herself turned a little, and in the mirror their eyes met--and in the
mirror Mr."You DO care--a LITTLE!"he
breathed, as he took her in his arms.Miss Maggie shook her head vigorously against his
coat-collar."I care--a GREAT DEAL," whispered Miss Maggie to the coat-collar, with
shameless emphasis.triumphed the man, bestowing a rapturous kiss on the
tip of a small pink ear--the nearest point to Miss Maggie's lips that
was available, until, with tender determination, he turned her face to
his.A moment later, blushing rosily, Miss Maggie drew herself away."There, we've been quite silly enough--old folks like us."Love is never silly--not real love like ours.Besides,
we're only as old as we feel.I've
lost--YEARS since this morning.And you know I'm just beginning to
live--really live, anyway!"I'm afraid you act it," said Miss Maggie, with mock severity."YOU would--if you'd been through what _I_ have," retorted Mr."And when I think what a botch I made of it, to
begin with--You see, I didn't mean to start off with that, first thing;
and I was so afraid that--that even if you did care for John Smith, you
wouldn't for me--just at first.At arms' length he
held her off, his hands on her shoulders.His happy eyes searching her
face saw the dawn of the dazed, question."Wouldn't care for YOU if I did for John Smith!she demanded, her eyes slowly sweeping him
from head to foot and back again.Instinctively his tongue went back to the old manner of
address, but his hands still held her shoulders."You don't mean--you
can't mean that--that you didn't understand--that you DON'T understand
that I am--Oh, good Heavens!Well, I have made a mess of it this time,"
he groaned.Releasing his hold on her shoulders, he turned and began to
tramp up and down the room."Nice little John-Alden-Miles-Standish
affair this is now, upon my word!Miss Maggie, have I got to--to
propose to you all over again for--for another man, now?"I--I don't think I understand you.""Then you don't know--you didn't understand a few minutes ago, when
I--I spoke first, when I asked you about--about those twenty millions--"

She lifted her hand quickly, pleadingly.Smith, please, don't let's bring money into it at all.I don't
care--I don't care a bit if you haven't got any money.""If I HAVEN'T got any money!"Oh, yes, I know, I said I loved money."The rich red came back to
her face in a flood."But I didn't mean--And it's just as much of a
test and an opportunity when you DON'T have money--more so, if
anything.I never thought of--of how you
might take it--as if I WANTED it.Oh, can't
you--understand?""And I
thought I'd given myself away!He came to her and stood
close, but he did not offer to touch her."I thought, after I'd said
what I did about--about those twenty millions that you understood--that
you knew I was--Stanley Fulton himself."Miss Maggie stood motionless, her eyes looking
straight into his, amazed incredulous.Maggie, don't look at me
like that.She was backing away now, slowly, step by step.Anger, almost loathing,
had taken the place of the amazement and incredulity in her eyes.But--" "And you've been here all these months--yes,
years--under a false name, pretending to be what you weren't--talking
to us, eating at our tables, winning our confidence, letting us talk to
you about yourself, even pretending that--Oh, how could you?""Maggie, dearest," he begged, springing toward her, "if you'll only let
me--"

But she stopped him peremptorily, drawing herself to her full height."I am NOT your dearest," she flamed angrily."I did not give my
love--to YOU."I gave it to John Smith--gentleman, I supposed.A man--poor, yes,
I believed him poor; but a man who at least had a right to his NAME!Stanley G. Fulton, spy, trickster, who makes life
itself a masquerade for SPORT!Stanley G. Fulton,
and--I do not wish to."The words ended in a sound very like a sob; but
Miss Maggie, with her head still high, turned her back and walked to
the window.The man, apparently stunned for a moment, stood watching her, his eyes
grieved, dismayed, hopeless.Then, white-faced, he turned and walked
toward the door.With his hand almost on the knob he slowly wheeled
about and faced the woman again.He hesitated visibly, then in a dull,
lifeless voice he began to speak."Miss Maggie, before John Smith steps entirely out of your life, he
would like to say just this, please, not on justification, but on
explanation of----of Stanley G. Fulton.Fulton did not intend to be a
spy, or a trickster, or to make life a masquerade for--sport.He was a
lonely old man--he felt old.True, he had no
one to care for, but--he had no one to care for HIM, either.He did have a great deal of money--more than he knew what
to do with.Oh, he tried--various ways of spending it.They resulted, chiefly,
in showing him that he wasn't--as wise as he might be in that line,
perhaps."At the window Miss Maggie still stood,
with her back turned as before."The time came, finally," resumed the man, "when Fulton began to wonder
what would become of his millions when he was done with them.He had a
feeling that he would like to will a good share of them to some of his
own kin; but he had no nearer relatives than some cousins back East,
in--Hillerton."Miss Maggie at the window drew in her breath, and held it suspended,
letting it out slowly."He didn't know anything about these cousins," went on the man dully,
wearily, "and he got to wondering what they would do with the money.I
think he felt, as you said to-day that you feel, that one must know how
to spend five dollars if one would get the best out of five thousand.So Fulton felt that, before he gave a man fifteen or twenty millions,
he would like to know--what he would probably do with them.He had seen
so many cases where sudden great wealth had brought--great sorrow."And so then he fixed up a little scheme; he would give each one of
these three cousins of his a hundred thousand dollars apiece, and then,
unknown to them, he would get acquainted with them, and see which of
them would be likely to make the best use of those twenty millions.It
was a silly scheme, of course,--a silly, absurd foolishness from
beginning to end.It--"

He did not finish his sentence.There was a rush of swift feet, a swish
of skirts, then full upon him there fell a whirlwind of sobs, clinging
arms, and incoherent ejaculations."It wasn't silly--it wasn't silly.Oh, I think it was--WONDERFUL!And
I--I'm so ASHAMED!"Later--very much later, when something like lucid coherence had become
an attribute of their conversation, as they sat together upon the old
sofa, the man drew a long breath and said:--

"Then I'm quite forgiven?""And you consider yourself engaged to BOTH John Smith and Stanley G."It sounds pretty bad, but--yes," blushed Miss Maggie."And you must love Stanley G. Fulton just exactly as well--no, a little
better, than you did John Smith.""I'll--try to--if he's as lovable."Miss Maggie's head was at a saucy
tilt."He'll try to be; but--it won't be all play, you know, for you.You've
got to tell him what to do with those twenty millions.By the way, what
WILL you do with them?"Fulton, you HAVE got--And
I forgot all about--those twenty millions."They belong to
Fulton, if you please.Furthermore, CAN'T you call me anything but that
abominable 'Mr.You might--er--abbreviate
it to--er--' Stan,' now.""Perhaps so--but I shan't," laughed Miss Maggie,--"not yet.You may be
thankful I have wits enough left to call you anything--after becoming
engaged to two men all at once.""And with having the responsibility of spending twenty millions, too.""Oh, we can do so much with that money!Why, only think what is
needed right HERE--better milk for the babies, and a community house,
and the streets cleaner, and a new carpet for the church, and a new
hospital with--"

"But, see here, aren't you going to spend some of that money on
yourself?"I'm going to Egypt, and China, and
Japan--with you, of course; and books--oh, you never saw such a lot of
books as I shall buy.And--oh, I'll spend heaps on just my selfish
self--you see if I don't!But, first,--oh, there are so many things
that I've so wanted to do, and it's just come over me this minute that
NOW I can do them!And you KNOW how Hillerton needs a new hospital.""And I want to build a store
and run it so the girls can LIVE, and a factory, too, and decent homes
for the workmen, and a big market, where they can get their food at
cost; and there's the playground for the children, and--"

But Mr.Smith was laughing, and lifting both hands in mock despair."Look here," he challenged, "I THOUGHT you were marrying ME, but--ARE
you marrying me or that confounded money?""Yes, I know; but you see--" She stopped short.Suddenly she laughed again, and threw into his eyes a look so merry, so
whimsical, so altogether challenging, that he demanded:--

"Well, what is it now?""Oh, it's so good, I have--half a mind to tell you."Miss Maggie had left the sofa, and was standing, as if half-poised for
flight, midway to the door."I think--yes, I will tell you," she nodded, her cheeks very pink; "but
I wanted to be--over here to tell it."Do you remember those letters I got awhile ago,
and the call from the Boston; lawyer, that I--I wouldn't tell you
about?""Well; you know you--you thought they--they had something to do
with--my money; that I--I'd lost some.""Well, they--they did have something to do--with money.""Oh, why wouldn't you tell me
then--and let me help you some way?"She shook her head nervously and backed nearer the door.If you don't--I won't tell you.""Well, as I said, it did have something to do--with my money; but just
now, when you asked me if I--I was marrying you or your money--"

"But I was in fun--you know I was in fun!""Oh, yes, I knew that," nodded Miss Maggie."But it--it made me laugh
and remember--the letters.You see, they weren't as you thought.They
didn't tell me of--of money lost.That father's Cousin George in Alaska had died and left me--fifty
thousand dollars.""But, my dear woman, why in Heaven's name wouldn't you tell me that?""You see, I thought
you were poor--very poor, and I--I wouldn't even own up to it myself,
but I knew, in my heart, that I was afraid, if you heard I had this
money, you wouldn't--you wouldn't--ask me to--to--"

She was blushing so adorably now that the man understood and leaped to
his feet."Maggie, you--darling!"But the door had shut--Miss Maggie had fled.CHAPTER XXIV

THAT MISERABLE MONEY


In the evening, after the Martin girls had gone to their rooms, Miss
Maggie and Mr."Of course," he began with a sigh, "I'm really not out of the woods at
all.Blissfully happy as I am, I'm really deeper in the woods than
ever, for now I've got you there with me, to look out for.However
successfully John Smith might dematerialize into nothingness--Maggie
Duff can't.""No, I know she can't," admitted Miss Maggie soberly."Yet if she marries John Smith she'll have to--and if she doesn't marry
him, how's Stanley G. Fulton going to do his courting?Smith, you'll HAVE to tell them--who you are.You'll have to tell them
right away."The man made a playfully wry face."I shall be glad," he observed, "when I shan't have to be held off at
the end of a 'Mr.'!However, we'll let that pass--until we settle the
other matter.Have you given any thought as to HOW I'm going to tell
Cousin Frank and Cousin James and Cousin Flora that I am Stanley G."No--except that you must do it," she answered decidedly."I don't
think you ought to deceive them another minute--not another minute.""And had you thought--as to
what would happen when I did tell them?""Why, n-no, not particularly, except that--that they naturally wouldn't
like it, at first, and that you'd have to explain--just as you did to
me--why you did it.""And do you think they'll like it any better--when I do explain?Miss Maggie meditated; then, a little tremulously she drew in her
breath."Why, you'd have to tell them that--that you did it for a test,
wouldn't you?""And they'd know--they couldn't help knowing--that they had failed to
meet it adequately."And would that help matters any--make things any happier, all
around?""No--oh, no," she frowned despairingly."Would it do anybody any REAL good, now?"N-no," she admitted reluctantly, "except that--that you'd be doing
right."And another thing--aside from the
mortification, dismay, and anger of my good cousins, have you thought
what I'd be bringing on you?"In less than half a dozen hours after the Blaisdells knew that
Mr.John Smith was Stanley G. Fulton, Hillerton would know it.And in
less than half a dozen more hours, Boston, New York, Chicago,--to say
nothing of a dozen lesser cities,--would know it--if there didn't
happen to be anything bigger on foot.Headlines an inch high would
proclaim the discovery of the missing Stanley G. Fulton, and the fine
print below would tell everything that happened, and a great deal that
didn't happen, in the carrying-out of the eccentric multi-millionaire's
extraordinary scheme of testing his relatives with a hundred thousand
dollars apiece to find a suitable heir.Your picture would adorn the
front page of the yellowest of yellow journals, and--"

"MY picture!"Oh, yes, yes," smiled the man imperturbably.Aren't you the affianced bride of Mr.I can see them
now: 'In Search of an Heir and Finds a Wife.'--'Charming Miss Maggie
Duff Falls in Love with Plain John Smith,' and--"

"Oh, no, no," moaned Miss Maggie, shrinking back as if already the
lurid headlines were staring her in the face."Oh, well, it might not be so bad as that, of course.Undoubtedly there are elements for a pretty good story in the
case, and some man, with nothing more important to write up, is bound
to make the most of it somewhere.There's
sure to be unpleasant publicity, my dear, if the truth once leaks out.""But what--what HAD you planned to do?""Well, I HAD planned something like this: pretty quick, now, Mr.Smith
was to announce the completion of his Blaisdell data, and, with
properly grateful farewells, take his departure from Hillerton.There he would go inland on some sort of a
simple expedition with a few native guides and carriers, but no other
companion.Somewhere in the wilderness he would shed his beard and his
name, and would emerge in his proper person of Stanley G. Fulton and
promptly take passage for the States.Of course, upon the arrival in
Chicago of Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, there would be a slight flurry at his
appearance, and a few references to the hundred-thousand-dollar gifts
to the Eastern relatives, and sundry speculations as to the why and how
of the exploring trip.There would be various rumors and alleged
interviews; but Mr.Stanley G. Fulton never was noted for his
communicativeness, and, after a very short time, the whole thing would
be dismissed as probably another of the gentleman's well-known
eccentricities."Oh, I see," murmured Miss Maggie, in very evident relief."That would
be better--in some ways; only it does seem terrible not to--to tell
them who you are.""But we have just proved that to do that wouldn't bring happiness
anywhere, and would bring misery everywhere, haven't we?""Then why do it?--particularly as by not doing it I am not defrauding
anybody in the least.No; that part isn't worrying me a bit now--but
there is one point that does worry me very much."My scheme gets Stanley G. Fulton back to life and Chicago
very nicely; but it doesn't get Maggie Duff there worth a cent!Maggie
Duff can't marry Mr.John Smith in Hillerton and arrive in Chicago as
the wife of Stanley G. Fulton, can she?""N-no, but he--he can come back and get her--if he wants her."(Miss Maggie blushed all the more at the
method and the fervor of Mr.Smith, smiling at Miss
Maggie's hurried efforts to smooth her ruffled hair.He'd look altogether too much like--like Mr."But your beard will be gone--I wonder how I shall like you without a
beard."Smith laughed and threw up his hands with a doleful shrug."That's what comes of courting as one man and marrying as another," he
groaned.Then, sternly: "I'll warn you right now, Maggie Duff, that
Stanley G. Fulton is going to be awfully jealous of John Smith if you
don't look out.""He should have thought of that before," retorted Miss Maggie, her eyes
mischievous."But, tell me, wouldn't you EVER dare to come--in your
proper person?""Never!--or, at least, not for some time.The beard would be gone, to
be sure; but there'd be all the rest to tattle--eyes, voice, size,
manner, walk--everything; and smoked glasses couldn't cover all that,
you know.They'd only result
in making me look more like John Smith than ever.John Smith, you
remember, wore smoked glasses for some time to hide Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton from the ubiquitous reporter.Stanley G. Fulton can't
come to Hillerton.So, as Mahomet can't go to the mountain, the
mountain must come to Mahomet."Miss Maggie's eyes were growing dangerously mutinous."That you will have to come to Chicago--yes.""I love you with your head tilted that way."(Miss Maggie promptly
tilted it the other.)"Or that, either, for that matter," continued Mr."However, speaking of courting--Mr.Fulton will do
that, all right, and endeavor to leave nothing lacking, either as to
quantity or quality.Haven't you got some friend that you can visit?"Miss Maggie's answer was prompt and emphatic--too prompt and too
emphatic for unquestioning acceptance."Oh, yes, you have," asserted the man cheerfully."I don't know her
name--but she's there.She's Waving a red flag from your face this
minute!Well, turn your head away, if you like--if you can
listen better that way," he went on tranquilly paying no attention to
her little gasp."Well, all you have to do is to write the lady you're
coming, and go.Stanley G. Fulton will find
a way to meet her.Then he'll call and meet
you--and be so pleased to see you!There'll be a
regular whirlwind courtship then--calls, dinners, theaters, candy,
books, flowers!You'll be immensely surprised, of course, but you'll accept.Then we'll
get married," he finished with a deep sigh of satisfaction."Say, CAN'T you call me anything--" he began wrathfully, but
interrupted himself."However, it's better that you don't, after all.But you wait
till you meet Mr.Now, what's her name,
and where does she live?"Miss Maggie laughed in spite of herself, as she said severely: "Her
name, indeed!Stanley G. Fulton is so in the habit of
having his own way that he forgets he is still Mr.However,
there IS an old schoolmate," she acknowledged demurely.Now, write her at once, and tell her you're
coming.""But she--she may not be there."I think you'd
better plan to go pretty soon after I go to South America.Stanley G. Fulton arrives in Chicago and can write
the news back here to Hillerton.Oh, they'll get it in the papers, in
time, of course; but I think it had better come from you first.You
see--the reappearance on this earth of Mr.Stanley G. Fulton is going
to be of--of some moment to them, you know.Hattie, for
instance, who is counting on the rest of the money next November.""Yes, I know, it will mean a good deal to them, of course.Still, I
don't believe Hattie is really expecting the money.At any rate, she
hasn't said anything about it very lately--perhaps because she's been
too busy bemoaning the pass the present money has brought them to.""No, no--I didn't mean to bring that up," apologized Miss Maggie
quickly, with an apprehensive glance into his face."And it wasn't
miserable money a bit!Besides, Hattie has--has learned her lesson, I'm
sure, and she'll do altogether differently in the new home.Smith, am I never to--to come back here?"Indeed we can--some time, by and by, when all this has blown over, and
they've forgotten how Mr.Meanwhile, you can come alone--a VERY little.I shan't let you leave me
very much.But I understand; you'll have to come to see your friends.Besides, there are all those playgrounds for the babies and cleaner
milk for the streets, and--"

"Cleaner milk for the streets, indeed!"Oh, yes, it WAS the milk for the babies, wasn't it?""Well, however that may be you'll have to come back to
superintend all those things you've been wanting to do so long.But"--his face grew a little wistful--"you don't want to spend too much
time here.You know--Chicago has a few babies that need cleaner milk."Her face grew softly luminous as it had grown
earlier in the afternoon."So you can bestow some of your charity there; and--"

"It isn't charity," she interrupted with suddenly flashing eyes."Oh,
how I hate that word--the way it's used, I mean.Of course, the real
charity means love.I suppose it was LOVE that made John
Daly give one hundred dollars to the Pension Fund Fair--after he'd
jewed it out of those poor girls behind his counters!Morse
went around everywhere telling how kind dear Mr.Daly was to give so
much to charity!Nobody wants charity--except a few lazy
rascals like those beggars of Flora's!And
if half the world gave the other half its rights there wouldn't BE any
charity, I believe."Smith
held up both hands in mock terror."I shall be petitioning her for my
bread and butter, yet!"Smith, when I think of all that
money"--her eyes began to shine again--"and of what we can do with it,
I--I just can't believe it's so!""But you aren't expecting that twenty millions are going to right all
the wrongs in the world, are you?""No, oh, no; but we can help SOME that we know about.But it isn't that
I just want to GIVE, you know.We must get behind things--to the
causes.We must--"

"We must make the Mr.Dalys pay more to their girls before they pay
anything to pension funds, eh?"Smith, as Miss Maggie came
to a breathless pause."Oh, can't you SEE what we can
do--with that twenty million dollars?"Smith, his gaze on Miss Maggie's flushed cheeks and shining eyes,
smiled tenderly."I see--that I'm being married for my money--after all!"sniffed Miss Maggie, so altogether bewitchingly that Mr.Smith
gave her a rapturous kiss.JOHN SMITH


Early in July Mr.He made a
farewell call upon each of the Blaisdell families, and thanked them
heartily for all their kindness in assisting him with his Blaisdell
book.The Blaisdells, one and all, said they were very sorry to have him go.Miss Flora frankly wiped her eyes, and told Mr.Smith she could never,
never thank him enough for what he had done for her.Mellicent, too,
with shy eyes averted, told him she should never forget what he had
done for her--and for Donald.James and Flora and Frank--and even Jane!--said that they would like to
have one of the Blaisdell books, when they were published, to hand down
in the family.Flora took out her purse and said that she would pay for
hers now; but Mr.Smith hastily, and with some evident embarrassment,
refused the money, saying that he could not tell yet what the price of
the book would be.All the Blaisdells, except Frank, Fred, and Bessie, went to the station
to see Mr.They told him he was
just like one of the family, anyway, and they declared they hoped he
would come back soon.Frank telephoned him that he would have gone,
too, if he had not had so much to do at the store.Smith seemed pleased at all this attention--he seemed, indeed,
quite touched; but he seemed also embarrassed--in fact, he seemed often
embarrassed during those last few days at Hillerton.Miss Maggie Duff did not go to the station to see Mr.Miss
Flora, on her way home, stopped at the Duff cottage and reproached Miss
Maggie for the delinquency."All the rest of us did,
'most."You're Blaisdells--but I'm not, you know.""You're just as good as one, Maggie Duff!Besides, hasn't that man
boarded here for over a year, and paid you good money, too?""Why, y-yes, of course.""Well, then, I don't think it would have hurt you any to show him this
last little attention.He'll think you don't like him, or--or are mad
about something, when all the rest of us went.""Well, then, if--Why, Maggie Duff, you're BLUSHING!"she broke off,
peering into Miss Maggie's face in a way that did not tend to lessen
the unmistakable color that was creeping to her forehead.I declare, if you were twenty years younger, and I didn't
know better, I should say that--" She stopped abruptly, then plunged
on, her countenance suddenly alight with a new idea."NOW I know why
you didn't go to the station, Maggie Duff!That man proposed to you,
and you refused him!"gasped Miss Maggie, her face scarlet.Hattie always said it would be a match--from
the very first, when he came here to your house."gasped Miss Maggie again, looking about her very much as if
she were meditating flight."Well, she did--but I didn't believe it.You refused
him--now, didn't you?"Miss Maggie caught her breath a little convulsively."Well, I suppose you didn't,
then, if you say so.And I don't need to ask if you accepted him.You
didn't, of course, or you'd have been there to see him off.And he
wouldn't have gone then, anyway, probably.So he didn't ask you, I
suppose.Well, I never did believe, like Hattie did, that--"

"Flora," interrupted Miss Maggie desperately, "WILL you stop talking in
that absurd way?Listen, I did not care to go to the station to-day.I'm going to see my old classmate, Nellie
Maynard--Mrs.It's lovely, of course, only--only I--I'm so
surprised!"All the more reason why I should, then.It's time I did," smiled Miss
Maggie.And I do hope you can DO it, and
that it won't peter out at the last minute, same's most of your good
times do.And you've had such a hard life--and your
boarder leaving, too!That'll make a lot of difference in your
pocketbook, won't it?But, Maggie, you'll have to have some new
clothes."I've got to have--oh,
lots of things."And, Maggie,"--Miss Flora's face grew
eager,--"please, PLEASE, won't you let me help you a little--about
those clothes?And get some nice ones--some real nice ones, for once.Please, Maggie, there's a good girl!""Thank you, no, dear," refused Miss Maggie, shaking her head with a
smile."But I appreciate your kindness just the same--indeed, I do!""If you wouldn't be so horrid proud," pouted Miss Flora.I was going to tell
you soon, anyway, and I'll tell it now.I HAVE money, dear,--lots of it
now."Father's Cousin George died two months ago.""Yes; and to father's daughter he left--fifty thousand dollars."But he loved father, you know, years ago,
and father loved him.""But had you ever heard from him--late years?"Father was very angry because he went to Alaska in the first
place, you know, and they haven't ever written very often."They sent me a thousand--just for pin money, they
said.The lawyer's written several times, and he's been here once.I
believe it's all to come next month.""Oh, I'm so glad, Maggie," breathed Flora.I don't know
of anybody I'd rather see take a little comfort in life than you!"At the door, fifteen minutes later, Miss Flora said again how glad she
was; but she added wistfully:--

"I'm sure I don't know, though, what I'm going to do all summer without
you.Just think how lonesome we'll be--you gone to Chicago, Hattie and
Jim and all their family moved to Plainville, and even Mr.And I think we're going to miss Mr."Indeed, I do think he was a very nice man!""Now, Flora, I shall want you to go shopping with me lots.And Miss Flora, eagerly entering into Miss Maggie's discussion of
frills and flounces, failed to notice that Miss Maggie had dropped the
subject of Mr.Hillerton had much to talk about during those summer days.Smith's
going had created a mild discussion--the "ancestor feller" was well
known and well liked in the town.But even his departure did not arouse
the interest that was bestowed upon the removal of the James Blaisdells
to Plainville; and this, in turn, did not cause so great an excitement
as did the news that Miss Maggie Duff had inherited fifty thousand
dollars and had gone to Chicago to spend it.And the fact that nearly
all who heard this promptly declared that they hoped she WOULD spend a
good share of it--in Chicago, or elsewhere--on herself, showed pretty
well just where Miss Maggie Duff stood in the hearts of Hillerton.It was early in September that Miss Flora had the letter from Miss
Maggie.Not but that she had received letters from Miss Maggie before,
but that the contents of this one made it at once, to all the
Blaisdells, "the letter."Miss Flora began to read it, gave a little cry, and sprang to her feet.Standing, her breath suspended, she finished it.Five minutes later,
gloves half on and hat askew, she was hurrying across the common to her
brother Frank's home."Jane, Jane," she panted, as soon as she found her sister-in-law."I've
had a letter from Maggie.She's just been living on having that money.And us, with all we've
lost, too!But, then, maybe we wouldn't have got it, anyway.And I never thought to bring it," ejaculated Miss Flora
vexedly.She said it would be in all the Eastern papers right away,
of course, but she wanted to tell us first, so we wouldn't be so
surprised.Walked into his lawyer's office without a
telegram, or anything.Tyndall
brought home the news that night in an 'Extra'; but that's all it
told--just that Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, the multi-millionaire who
disappeared nearly two years ago on an exploring trip to South America,
had come back alive and well.Then it told all about the two letters he
left, and the money he left to us, and all that, Maggie said; and it
talked a lot about how lucky it was that he got back just in time
before the other letter had to be opened next November.But it didn't
say any more about his trip, or anything.The morning papers will have
more, Maggie said, probably.""Yes, of course, of course," nodded Jane, rolling the corner of her
upper apron nervously.(Since the forty-thousand-dollar loss Jane had
gone back to her old habit of wearing two aprons.)"Where DO you
suppose he's been all this time?"Maggie said it wasn't known--that the paper didn't say.It was an
'Extra' anyway, and it just got in the bare news of his return.Besides, Maggie'll
write again about it, I'm sure.I'm so glad she's having
such a good time!""Yes, of course, of course," nodded Jane again nervously."Say, Flora,
I wonder--do you suppose WE'LL ever hear from him?He left us all that
money--he knows that, of course.He can't ask for it back--the lawyer
said he couldn't do that!But, I wonder--do you
suppose we ought to write him and--and thank him?"exclaimed Miss Flora, aghast.I'd be
scared to death to do such a thing as that.Oh, you don't think we've
got to do THAT?"We'd want to do what was right and proper, of course.But I don't see--" She paused helplessly.Miss Flora gave a sudden hysterical little laugh."Well, I don't see how we're going to find out what's proper, in this
case," she giggled."We can't write to a magazine, same as I did when I
wanted to know how to answer invitations and fix my knives and forks on
the table.We CAN'T write to them, 'cause nothing like this ever
happened before, and they wouldn't know what to say.How'd we look
writing, 'Please, dear Editor, when a man wills you a hundred thousand
dollars and then comes to life again, is it proper or not proper to
write and thank him?'They'd think we was crazy, and they'd have reason
to!For my part, I--"

The telephone bell rang sharply, and Jane rose to answer it.When she came back she was even more excited.she questioned, as Miss
Flora got hastily to her feet.I left everything just as it was and ran, when I got the
letter.I'll get a paper myself on the way home.I'm going to call up
Hattie, too, on the long distance.My, it's'most as exciting as it was
when it first came,--the money, I mean,--isn't it?"panted Miss Flora
as she hurried away.The Blaisdells bought many papers during the next few days.But even by
the time that the Stanley G. Fulton sensation had dwindled to a short
paragraph in an obscure corner of a middle page, they (and the public
in general) were really little the wiser, except for these bare facts:--

Stanley G. Fulton had arrived at a South American hotel, from the
interior, had registered as S. Fulton, frankly to avoid publicity, and
had taken immediate passage to New York.Arriving at New York, still to
avoid publicity, he had not telegraphed his attorneys, but had taken
the sleeper for Chicago, and had fortunately not met any one who
recognized him until his arrival in that city.He had brought home
several fine specimens of Incan textiles and potteries: and he declared
that he had had a very enjoyable and profitable trip.He did not care to talk of his experiences, he said.For a time, of course, his return was made much of.Fake interviews and
rumors of threatened death and disaster in impenetrable jungles made
frequent appearance; but in an incredibly short time the flame of
interest died from want of fuel to feed upon; and, as Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton himself had once predicted, the matter was soon dismissed as
merely another of the multi-millionaire's well-known eccentricities.All of this the Blaisdells heard from Miss Maggie in addition to seeing
it in the newspapers.But very soon, from Miss Maggie, they began to
learn more.Before a fortnight had passed, Miss Flora received another
letter from Chicago that sent her flying as before to her sister-in-law."Jane, Jane, Maggie's MET HIM!"she cried, breathlessly bursting into
the kitchen where Jane was paring the apples that she would not trust
to the maid's more wasteful knife.With a hasty twirl of a now reckless knife, Jane finished the
last apple, set the pan on the table before the maid, and hurried her
visitor into the living-room."Now, tell me quick--what did she say?"Yes--yes--everything," nodded Miss Flora, sinking into a chair."She
liked him real well, she said and he knows all about that she belongs
to us.Oh, I hope she didn't
tell him about--Fred!""And that awful gold-mine stock," moaned Jane."But she wouldn't--I
know she wouldn't!""Of course she wouldn't," cried Miss Flora."'Tisn't like Maggie one
bit!She'd only tell the nice things, I'm sure.And, of course, she'd
tell him how pleased we were with the money!"And to think she's met him--really met
him!"She turned an excited face to her
daughter, who had just entered the room.Aunt
Flora's just had a letter from Aunt Maggie, and she's met Mr.Fulton--actually TALKED with him!"Yes, he's real nice, your Aunt
Maggie says, and she likes him very much."Tyndall brought him home
one night and introduced him to his wife and Maggie; and since then
he's been very nice to them.He's taken them out in his automobile, and
taken them to the theater twice.""That's because she belongs to us, of course," nodded Jane wisely."Yes, I suppose so," agreed Flora."And I think it's very kind of him.""_I_ think he does it because he
WANTS to.I'll warrant she's
nicer and sweeter and--and, yes, PRETTIER than lots of those old
Chicago women.Aunt Maggie looked positively HANDSOME that day she left
here last July.Probably he LIKES
to take her to places.Anyhow, I'm glad she's having one good time
before she dies.""Yes, so am I, my dear."I only wish he'd marry her and--and give her a good time all her
life," avowed Mellicent, lifting her chin.She's good enough for him," bridled Mellicent."Aunt
Maggie's good enough for anybody!""Maggie's a saint--if
ever there was one.""Yes, but I shouldn't call her a MARRYING saint," smiled Jane."Well, I don't know about that," frowned Miss Flora thoughtfully."Hattie always declared there'd be a match between her and Mr."Well, then, I
shall stick to my original statement that Maggie Duff is a saint, all
right, but not a marrying one--unless some one marries her now for her
money, of course.""As if Aunt Maggie'd stand for that!""Besides, she
wouldn't have to!Aunt Maggie's good enough to be married for herself.""There, there, child, just because you are a love-sick little piece of
romance just now, you needn't think everybody else is," her mother
reproved her a little sharply.But Mellicent only laughed merrily as she disappeared into her own room.Smith, I wonder where he is, and if he'll ever come
back here," mused Miss Flora, aloud.He was a very
nice man, and I liked him.""Goodness, Flora, YOU aren't, getting romantic, too, are you?"teased
her sister-in-law.ejaculated Miss Flora sharply, buttoning up her coat."I'm no more romantic than--than poor Maggie herself is!"Two weeks later, to a day, came Miss Maggie's letter announcing her
engagement to Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, and saying that she was to be
married in Chicago before Christmas.CHAPTER XXVI

REENTER MR.STANLEY G. FULTON


In the library of Mrs.Stanley G.
Fulton was impatiently awaiting the appearance of Miss Maggie Duff.In
a minute she came in, looking charmingly youthful in her new,
well-fitting frock.The man, quickly on his feet at her entrance, gave her a lover's ardent
kiss; but almost instantly he held her off at arms' length."Why, dearest, what's the matter?""You look as if--if something had happened--not exactly a bad
something, but--What is it?""That's one of the very nicest things about you, Mr.Stanley-G.-Fulton-John-Smith," she sighed, nestling comfortably into
the curve of his arm, as they sat down on the divan;--"that you NOTICE
things so.And it seems so good to me to have somebody--NOTICE."And to think of all these years I've wasted!""Oh, but I shan't be lonely any more now.And, listen--I'll tell you
what made me look so funny.You know I
wrote them--about my coming marriage.""I believe--I'll let you read the letter for yourself, Stanley.It
tells some things, toward the end that I think you'll like to know,"
she said, a little hesitatingly, as she held out the letter she had
brought into the room with her.I'd like to read it," cried Fulton, whisking the closely written
sheets from the envelope.MY DEAR MAGGIE (Flora had written): Well, mercy me, you have given us a
surprise this time, and no mistake!Yet we're all real glad, Maggie,
and we hope you'll be awfully happy.You've had such an awfully hard time all your life!Well, when your letter came, we were just going out to Jim's for an
old-fashioned Thanksgiving dinner, so I took it along with me and read
it to them all.I kept it till we were all together, too, though I most
bursted with the news all the way out.Well, you ought to have heard their tongues wag!They were all struck
dumb first, for a minute, all except Mellicent.She spoke up the very
first thing, and clapped her hands.I knew Aunt Maggie was good
enough for anybody!"To explain that I'll have to go back a little.We were talking one day
about you--Jane and Mellicent and me--and we said you were a saint,
only not a marrying saint.But Mellicent thought you were, and it seems
she was right.Oh, of course, we'd all thought once Mr.Smith might
take a fancy to you, but we never dreamed of such a thing as this--Mr.Sakes alive--I can hardly sense it yet!Jane, for a minute, forgot how rich he was, and spoke right up real
quick--"It's for her money, of course.I KNEW some one would marry her
for that fifty thousand dollars!"But she laughed then, right off, with
the rest of us, at the idea of a man worth twenty millions marrying
ANYBODY for fifty thousand dollars.Benny says there ain't any man alive good enough for his Aunt Maggie,
so if Mr.Fulton gets to being too highheaded sometimes, you can tell
him what Benny says.But we're all real pleased, honestly, Maggie, and of course we're
terribly excited.We're so sorry you're going to be married out there
in Chicago.Why can't you make him come to Hillerton?Jane says she'd
be glad to make a real nice wedding for you--and when Jane says a thing
like that, you can know how much she's really saying, for Jane's
feeling awfully poor these days, since they lost all that money, you
know.Fulton, too--"Cousin Stanley," as Hattie
always calls him.Please give him our congratulations--but there, that
sounds funny, doesn't it?(But the etiquette editors in the magazines
say we must always give best wishes to the bride and congratulations to
the groom.)Only it seems funny here, to congratulate that rich Mr.I didn't mean it that way, Maggie.I
declare, if that sentence wasn't 'way in the middle of this third page,
and so awfully hard for me to write, anyway, I'd tear up this sheet and
begin another.But, after all, you'll understand, I'm sure.You KNOW we
all think the world of you, Maggie, and that I didn't mean anything
against YOU.Fulton is--is such a big man, and
all--But you know what I meant.Well, anyway, if you can't come here to be married, we hope you'll
bring him here soon so we can see him, and see you, too.We miss you
awfully, Maggie,--truly we do, especially since Jim's folks went, and
with Mr.Smith gone, too, Jane and I are real lonesome.Jim and Hattie like real well where they are.They've got a real pretty
home, and they're the biggest folks in town, so Hattie doesn't have to
worry for fear she won't live quite so fine as her neighbors--though
really I think Hattie's got over that now a good deal.That awful thing
of Fred's sobered her a lot, and taught her who her real friends were,
and that money ain't everything.Fred is doing splendidly now, just as steady as a clock.It does my
soul good to see him and his father together.And Bessie--she isn't near so disagreeable and airy as she was.Hattie
took her out of that school and put her into another where she's
getting some real learning and less society and frills and dancing.Jim
is doing well, and I think Hattie's real happy.Oh, of course, when we
first heard that Mr.Fulton had got back, I think she was kind of
disappointed.You know she always did insist we were going to have the
rest of that money if he didn't show up.But she told me just
Thanksgiving Day that she didn't know but 't was just as well, after
all, that they didn't have the money, for maybe Fred'd go wrong again,
or it would strike Benny this time.Anyhow, however much money she had,
she said, she'd never let her children spend so much again, and she'd
found out money didn't bring happiness, always, anyway.Mellicent and Donald are going to be married next summer.Donald don't
get a very big salary yet, but Mellicent says she won't mind a bit
going back to economizing again, now that for once she's had all the
chocolates and pink dresses she wanted.What a funny girl she is--but
she's a dear girl, just the same, and she's settled down real sensible
now.She and Donald are as happy as can be, and even Jane likes Donald
real well now.Jane's gone back to her tidies and aprons and skimping on everything.She says she's got to, to make up that forty thousand dollars.But she
enjoys it, I believe.Honestly, she acts'most as happy trying to save
five cents as Frank does earning it in his old place behind the
counter.And that's saying a whole lot, as you know.Jane knows very
well she doesn't have to pinch that way.They've got lots of the money
left, and Frank's business is better than ever.You complain because I don't tell you anything about myself in my
letters, but there isn't anything to tell.I am well and happy, and
I've just thought up the nicest thing to do.Mary Hicks came home from
Boston sick last September, and she's been here at my house ever since.Her own home ain't no place for a sick person, you know, with all those
children, and they're awfully poor, too.She works in a department store and was all
played out, but she's picked up wonderfully here and is going back next
week.Well, she was telling me about a girl that works with her at the same
counter, and saying how she wished she had a place like this to go to
for a rest and change, so I'm going to do it--give them one, I mean,
she and the other girls.Mary says there are a dozen girls that she
knows right there that are half-sick, but would get well in a minute if
they only had a few weeks of rest and quiet and good food.So I'm going
to take them, two at a time, so they'll be company for each other.Mary
is going to fix it up for me down there, and pick out the girls, and
she says she knows the man who owns the store will be glad to let them
off, for they are all good help, and he's been afraid he'd lose them.He'd offered them a month off, besides their vacation, but they
couldn't take it, because they didn't have any place to go or money to
pay.Of course, that part will be all right now.And I'm so glad and
excited I don't know what to do.Oh, I do hope you'll tell Mr.Fulton
some time how happy he's made me, and how perfectly splendid that
money's been for me.Well, Maggie, this is a long letter, and I must close.Tell me all
about the new clothes you are getting, and I hope you will get a lot.Lovingly yours,

FLORA.Maggie Duff, for pity's sake, never, never tell that man
that I ever went into mourning for him and put flowers before his
picture.Fulton folded the letter and handed
it back to Miss Maggie."I didn't feel that I was betraying confidences--under the
circumstances," murmured Miss Maggie."And there was a good deal in the letter that I DID want you to see,"
added Miss Maggie."Hm-m; the congratulations, for one thing, of course," twinkled the
man."I wanted you to see how really, in the end, that money was not doing
so much harm, after all," asserted Miss Maggie, with some dignity,
shaking her head at him reprovingly."I thought you'd be GLAD, sir!"I'm so glad that, when I come to make my will now, I
shouldn't wonder if I remembered them all again--a little--that is, if
I have anything left to will," he teased shamelessly."Oh, by the way,
that makes me think.I've just been putting up a monument to John
Smith.""But, my dear Maggie, something was due the man," maintained Fulton,
reaching for a small flat parcel near him and placing it in Miss
Maggie's hands."But--oh, Stanley, how could you?"she shivered, her eyes on the words
the millionaire had penciled on the brown paper covering of the parcel.With obvious reluctance Miss Maggie loosened the paper covers and
peered within.In her hands lay a handsome brown leather volume with gold letters,
reading:--

     The Blaisdell Family
           By
        John Smith

"And you--did that?"I shall send a copy each to Frank and Jim and Miss Flora, of
course.Poor
man, it's the least I can do for him--and the most--unless--" He
hesitated with an unmistakable look of embarrassment."Well, unless--I let you take me to Hillerton one of these days and see
if--if Stanley G. Fulton, with your gracious help, can make peace for
John Smith with those--er--cousins of mine.You see, I still feel
confoundedly like that small boy at the keyhole, and I'd like--to open
that door!And, oh, Stanley, it's the one thing needed
to make me perfectly happy," she sighed blissfully.THE END









End of Project Gutenberg's Oh, Money!(_Calls._) Jane!--A
servant of an extinct species.(_Enter JANE with soup-tureen._) I've news for you, my faithful Jane.(_Looks round in bewilderment._)

JANE (_sets table, puts soup, &c., on it_).There's your soup, old
Coddle.Mollycoddle, I calls you!If it war'n't for that tuppenny legacy, old Cod, I'd do my best
to pop you into an asylum for idiots.(_Exit, C., meets WHITWELL._)

CODDLE.So this is her boasted fidelity, her undying
affection!Why, the faithless, abominable, ungrateful, treacherous
vixen!But her face is enough to show the vile blackness of her heart!And
the money I've bequeathed her.She sha'n't stay another twenty-four
hours in my house.(_Sees WHITWELL._) Nor you either, you swindling
vagabond.Hallo, the wind's shifted with a vengeance!(_Shouts._) Thank
you, you're very kind.(_Bows._) Very sorry I invited you,
you scamp!Hope you'll find my dinner uneatable.(_Shouts._) Very
true; a lovely prospect indeed.A man as deaf as this fellow (_bows, and points
to table_) should be hanged as a warning.(_Politely._) This is your
last visit here, I assure you.If it were only lawful to kick one's father-in-law, I'd do it
on the spot.(_Shouts._) Your unvarying kindness to a mere stranger,
sir, is an honor to human nature.(_Pulls away best chair, and goes
for another._) No, no: shot if he shall have the best chair in the
house!If he don't like it, he can lump it.CODDLE (_returns with a stool_).Here's the proper seat for you, you
pig!(_Shouts._) I offer you this with the greatest pleasure.(_Drops voice._) You intolerable
old brute!WHITWELL (_bowing politely_).If you're ever my father-in-law, I'll
show you how to treat a gentleman.I'll give Eglantine to a coal-heaver
first,--the animal!(_Shouts._) Pray be seated, (_drops voice_) and
choke yourself.One gets a very fine appetite after a hard day's
sport.(_Drops voice._) Atrocious old ruffian!(_They sit._)

WHITWELL (_shouts_).Will not Miss Coddle dine with us to-day?(_Shouts._) She's not well.This
soup is cold, I fear.(_Offers some._)

WHITWELL.(_Bows courteously a refusal._)

CODDLE.(_Shouts._) Nay, I insist.(_Drops voice._)
It's smoked,--just fit for you.(_Drops voice._) Old
savage, lucky for you I adore your lovely daughter!Shall I pitch this tureen at his head?--Jane!(_Enter JANE with
a dish._) Take off the soup, Jane.(_Puts dish on table._)

WHITWELL (_shouts_).(_Puts partridge on his own plate._) Jane can't
boil spinach.(_Helps WHITWELL to the spinach._)

WHITWELL (_rises_).(_Drops voice._) Get rid of you
all the sooner.--Jane, cigars.(_Crosses to R._)

WHITWELL (_aside, furious_).JANE (_aside to WHITWELL_).Don't
upset your fish-kittle.We'll have a little fun with the old
sheep.JANE (_takes box from console, and offers it; shouts_).I hope they'll turn your
stomick.CODDLE (_seizes her ear_).(_Pulls her round._) I'm a sheep, am I?I'm a
mollycoddle, am I?You'll have a little fun out of the old sheep, will you?You
tell me to shut up, eh?Clap me into an asylum, will you?(_Lets go her
ear._)

JANE.(_Crosses to L., screaming._)

                          (_Enter EGLANTINE._)

EGLANTINE.For heaven's sake, what _is_ the matter?WHITWELL (_stupefied_).Perfectly well, sir; and so it seems can you.I
will repeat, if you wish it, every one of those delectable compliments
you paid me five minutes since.WHITWELL (_to EGLANTINE_).Miss Coddle, has he
been shamming deafness, then, all this time?A doctor cured his deafness only half
an hour ago.Dear old master, was it kind to deceive me in this fashion?now ye can hear, I love you tenderer than
ever.Tell you, you pig, you minx!I tell you to walk out of my house.CODDLE (_loud to WHITWELL_).You are an impostor,
sir.EGLANTINE (_shrieks_).(_Hides her
face in her hands._)

WHITWELL.or I should have lost the rapture of
that sweet avowal.Coddle, I love--I adore your daughter.You heard
a moment since the confession that escaped her innocent lips.Surely
you cannot turn a deaf ear to the voice of nature, and see us both
miserable for life.Remember, sir, you have now no deaf ear to turn.Give you my daughter after all your frightful
insults?Remember how you treated me, sir; and reflect, too, that you
began it.Insults are not insults unless intended to be heard.For
every thing I said, I apologize from the bottom of my heart.CODDLE (_after a pause_)._Eglantine._ Papa, of course he does.Whittermat, I can't give my daughter to
a man I never heard of in my life,--and with such a preposterous name
too!My name is Whitwell, my dear sir,--not Whittermat: nephew of
your old friend Benjamin Pottle.What did you tell me your name was Whittermat for?Some singular mistake, sir: I never did.Can't imagine how
the mistake could have occurred.Well, since you heard
all _I_ said--Ha, ha, ha!For every Roland of mine you
gave me two Olivers at least.Diamond cut diamond,--ha, ha, ha!All laugh heartily._)

JANE.I never thought I'd live to see this happy day,
master.Hold your tongue, you impudent cat!Mollycoddle,
indeed!Coddle, you won't go for to turn off a faithful servant in
this way.(_Aside to WHITWELL._) That legacy's lost.(_To CODDLE._) Ah,
master dear!you won't find nobody else as'll work their fingers to the
bone, and their voice to a thread-paper, as I have: up early and down
late, and yelling and screeching from morning till night.Well, the
house will go to rack and ruin when I'm gone,--that's one comfort.WHITWELL (_aside to JANE_).The money's yours, cash down, the day of my
wedding.Well, well, Jane, I'll forgive you, for luck.But I wish you knew how to boil spinach.Harrold for a week
from to-day, and invite all our friends (_to the audience_) to witness
the wedding.All who mean to come will please signify it by clapping their hands,
and the harder the better.(_Curtain falls._)

HITTY'S SERVICE FLAG

A Comedy in Two Acts

_By Gladys Ruth Bridgham_


Eleven female characters.Costumes, modern; scenery, an interior.Hitty, a patriotic spinster, quite alone in the
world, nevertheless hangs up a service flag in her window without any
right to do so, and opens a Tea Room for the benefit of the Red Cross.She gives shelter to Stella Hassy under circumstances that close other
doors against her, and offers refuge to Marjorie Winslow and her little
daughter, whose father in France finally gives her the right to the
flag.A strong dramatic presentation of a lovable character and an
ideal patriotism.Strongly recommended, especially for women's clubs._Price, 25 cents_

A Comedy in One Act

_By Helen Sherman Griffith_


Nine female characters.Costumes, modern; scenery, an interior.Eleanor will not forego luxuries nor in other ways "do
her bit," putting herself before her country; but when her old enemy,
Jane Rivers, comes to the Knitting Club straight from France to tell
the story of her experiences, she is moved to forget her quarrel and
leads them all in her sacrifices to the cause.An admirably stimulating
piece, ending with a "melting pot" to which the audience may also be
asked to contribute.Urged as a decided novelty in patriotic plays._Price, 25 cents_




GETTING THE RANGE

A Comedy in One Act

_By Helen Sherman Griffith_


Eight female characters.Costumes, modern; scenery, an exterior.Well
suited for out-of-door performances.Information of value to the enemy somehow leaks out from a frontier
town and the leak cannot be found or stopped.But Captain Brooke, of
the Secret Service, finally locates the offender amid a maze of false
clues, in the person of a washerwoman who hangs out her clothes day
after day in ways and places to give the desired information._Price, 25 cents_




LUCINDA SPEAKS

A Comedy in Two Acts

_By Gladys Ruth Bridgham_


Eight women.Isabel Jewett has dropped her homely middle name, Lucinda,
and with it many sterling traits of character, and is not a very good
mother to the daughter of her husband over in France.But circumstances
bring "Lucinda" to life again with wonderful results.A pretty and
dramatic contrast that is very effective._Price, 25 cents_


CHARACTERS

    ISABEL JEWETT, _aged 27_.MIRIAM, _her daughter, aged 7_.TESSIE FLANDERS, _aged 18_.DOUGLAS JEWETT, _aged 45_.HELEN, _her daughter, aged 20_.FLORENCE LINDSEY, _aged 25_.SYNOPSIS

ACT I.--Dining-room in Isabel Jewett's tenement, Roxbury, October, 1918.ACT II.--The same--three months later.WRONG NUMBERS

A Triologue Without a Moral

_By Essex Dane_


Three women.An intensely dramatic episode between
two shop-lifters in a department store, in which "diamond cuts diamond"
in a vividly exciting and absorbingly interesting battle of wits.A
great success in the author's hands in War Camp work, and recommended
in the strongest terms._Price, 25 cents_




FLEURETTE & CO.A Duologue in One Act

_By Essex Dane_


Two women.Paynter, a society lady who does not
pay her bills, by a mischance puts it into the power of a struggling
dressmaker, professionally known as "Fleurette & Co.," to teach her a
valuable lesson and, incidentally, to collect her bill.A strikingly
ingenious and entertaining little piece of strong dramatic interest,
strongly recommended._Price, 25 cents_

BAKER, Hamilton Place, Boston, Mass.Transcriber's Note:

    Every effort has been made to replicate this text as faithfully as
    possible.Italic text has been marked with _underscores_.They were led on by Balfour in person, who displayed
courage equal to his enthusiasm; and, in spite of every opposition,
forced the barricade, killing and wounding several of the defenders, and
compelling the rest to retreat to their second position.The precautions,
however, of Major Bellenden rendered this success unavailing; for no
sooner were the Covenanters in possession of the post, than a close and
destructive fire was poured into it from the Castle, and from those
stations which commanded it in the rear.Having no means of protecting
themselves from this fire, or of returning it with effect against men who
were under cover of their barricades and defences, the Covenanters were
obliged to retreat; but not until they had, with their axes, destroyed
the stockade, so as to render it impossible for the defenders to
re-occupy it.Balfour was the last man that retired.He even remained for a short space
almost alone, with an axe in his hand, labouring like a pioneer amid the
storm of balls, many of which were specially aimed against him.The
retreat of the party he commanded was not effected without heavy loss,
and served as a severe lesson concerning the local advantages possessed
by the garrison.The next attack of the Covenanters was made with more caution.A strong
party of marksmen, (many of them competitors at the game of the
popinjay,) under the command of Henry Morton, glided through the woods
where they afforded them the best shelter, and, avoiding the open road,
endeavoured, by forcing their way through the bushes and trees, and up
the rocks which surrounded it on either side, to gain a position, from
which, without being exposed in an intolerable degree, they might annoy
the flank of the second barricade, while it was menaced in front by a
second attack from Burley.The besieged saw the danger of this movement,
and endeavoured to impede the approach of the marksmen, by firing upon
them at every point where they showed themselves.The assailants, on the
other hand, displayed great coolness, spirit, and judgment, in the manner
in which they approached the defences.This was, in a great measure, to
be ascribed to the steady and adroit manner in which they were conducted
by their youthful leader, who showed as much skill in protecting his own
followers as spirit in annnoying the enemy.He repeatedly enjoined his marksmen to direct their aim chiefly upon the
red-coats, and to save the others engaged in the defence of the Castle;
and, above all, to spare the life of the old Major, whose anxiety made
him more than once expose himself in a manner, that, without such
generosity on the part of the enemy, might have proved fatal.A dropping
fire of musketry now glanced from every part of the precipitous mount on
which the Castle was founded.From bush to bush--from crag to crag--from
tree to tree, the marksmen continued to advance, availing themselves of
branches and roots to assist their ascent, and contending at once with
the disadvantages of the ground and the fire of the enemy.At length they
got so high on the ascent, that several of them possessed an opportunity
of firing into the barricade against the defenders, who then lay exposed
to their aim, and Burley, profiting by the confusion of the moment, moved
forward to the attack in front.His onset was made with the same
desperation and fury as before, and met with less resistance, the
defenders being alarmed at the progress which the sharp-shooters had made
in turning the flank of their position.Determined to improve his
advantage, Burley, with his axe in his hand, pursued the party whom he
had dislodged even to the third and last barricade, and entered it along
with them."Kill, kill--down with the enemies of God and his people!--No
quarter--The Castle is ours!"were the cries by which he animated his
friends; the most undaunted of whom followed him close, whilst the
others, with axes, spades, and other implements, threw up earth, cut
down trees, hastily labouring to establish such a defensive cover in the
rear of the second barricade as might enable them to retain possession
of it, in case the Castle was not carried by this coup-de-main.Lord Evandale could no longer restrain his impatience.He charged with a
few soldiers who had been kept in reserve in the court-yard of the
Castle; and, although his arm was in a sling, encouraged them, by voice
and gesture, to assist their companions who were engaged with Burley.The
combat now assumed an air of desperation.The narrow road was crowded
with the followers of Burley, who pressed forward to support their
companions.The soldiers, animated by the voice and presence of Lord
Evandale, fought with fury, their small numbers being in some measure
compensated by their greater skill, and by their possessing the upper
ground, which they defended desperately with pikes and halberds, as well
as with the but of the carabines and their broadswords.Those within the
Castle endeavoured to assist their companions, whenever they could so
level their guns as to fire upon the enemy without endangering their
friends.The sharp-shooters, dispersed around, were firing incessantly on
each object that was exposed upon the battlement.The Castle was
enveloped with smoke, and the rocks rang to the cries of the combatants.In the midst of this scene of confusion, a singular accident had nearly
given the besiegers possession of the fortress.Cuddie Headrigg, who had advanced among the marksmen, being well
acquainted with every rock and bush in the vicinity of the Castle, where
he had so often gathered nuts with Jenny Dennison, was enabled, by such
local knowledge, to advance farther, and with less danger, than most of
his companions, excepting some three or four who had followed him close.Now Cuddie, though a brave enough fellow upon the whole, was by no means
fond of danger, either for its own sake, or for that of the glory which
attends it.In his advance, therefore, he had not, as the phrase goes,
taken the bull by the horns, or advanced in front of the enemy's fire.On
the contrary, he had edged gradually away from the scene of action, and,
turning his line of ascent rather to the left, had pursued it until it
brought him under a front of the Castle different from that before which
the parties were engaged, and to which the defenders had given no
attention, trusting to the steepness of the precipice.There was,
however, on this point, a certain window belonging to a certain pantry,
and communicating with a certain yew-tree, which grew out of a steep
cleft of the rock, being the very pass through which Goose Gibbie was
smuggled out of the Castle in order to carry Edith's express to
Charnwood, and which had probably, in its day, been used for other
contraband purposes.Cuddie, resting upon the but of his gun, and looking
up at this window, observed to one of his companions,--"There's a place I
ken weel; mony a time I hae helped Jenny Dennison out o' the winnock,
forby creeping in whiles mysell to get some daffin, at e'en after the
pleugh was loosed.""And what's to hinder us to creep in just now?"said the other, who was a
smart enterprising young fellow."There's no muckle to hinder us, an that were a'," answered Cuddie; "but
what were we to do neist?""We'll take the Castle," cried the other; "here are five or six o' us,
and a' the sodgers are engaged at the gate.""Come awa wi' you, then," said Cuddie; "but mind, deil a finger ye maun
lay on Lady Margaret, or Miss Edith, or the auld Major, or, aboon a', on
Jenny Dennison, or ony body but the sodgers--cut and quarter amang them
as ye like, I carena.""Ay, ay," said the other, "let us once in, and we will make our ain terms
with them a'."Gingerly, and as if treading upon eggs, Cuddie began to ascend the
well-known pass, not very willingly; for, besides that he was something
apprehensive of the reception he might meet with in the inside, his
conscience insisted that he was making but a shabby requital for Lady
Margaret's former favours and protection.He got up, however, into the
yew-tree, followed by his companions, one after another.The window was
small, and had been secured by stancheons of iron; but these had been
long worn away by time, or forced out by the domestics to possess a free
passage for their own occasional convenience.Entrance was therefore
easy, providing there was no one in the pantry, a point which Cuddie
endeavoured to discover before he made the final and perilous step.While
his companions, therefore, were urging and threatening him behind, and he
was hesitating and stretching his neck to look into the apartment, his
head became visible to Jenny Dennison, who had ensconced herself in said
pantry as the safest place in which to wait the issue of the assault.So
soon as this object of terror caught her eye, she set up a hysteric
scream, flew to the adjacent kitchen, and, in the desperate agony of
fear, seized on a pot of kailbrose which she herself had hung on the fire
before the combat began, having promised to Tam Halliday to prepare his
breakfast for him.Thus burdened, she returned to the window of the
pantry, and still exclaiming, "Murder!murder!--we are a' harried and
ravished--the Castle's taen--tak it amang ye!"she discharged the whole
scalding contents of the pot, accompanied with a dismal yell, upon the
person of the unfortunate Cuddie.However welcome the mess might have
been, if Cuddie and it had become acquainted in a regular manner, the
effects, as administered by Jenny, would probably have cured him of
soldiering for ever, had he been looking upwards when it was thrown upon
him.But, fortunately for our man of war, he had taken the alarm upon
Jenny's first scream, and was in the act of looking down, expostulating
with his comrades, who impeded the retreat which he was anxious to
commence; so that the steel cap and buff coat which formerly belonged to
Sergeant Bothwell, being garments of an excellent endurance, protected
his person against the greater part of the scalding brose.Enough,
however, reached him to annoy him severely, so that in the pain and
surprise he jumped hastily out of the tree, oversetting his followers, to
the manifest danger of their limbs, and, without listening to arguments,
entreaties, or authority, made the best of his way by the most safe road
to the main body of the army whereunto he belonged, and could neither by
threats nor persuasion be prevailed upon to return to the attack.[Illustration: Jenny Dennison--050]


As for Jenny, when she had thus conferred upon one admirer's outward man
the viands which her fair hands had so lately been in the act of
preparing for the stomach of another, she continued her song of alarm,
running a screaming division upon all those crimes, which the lawyers
call the four pleas of the crown, namely, murder, fire, rape, and
robbery.These hideous exclamations gave so much alarm, and created such
confusion within the Castle, that Major Bellenden and Lord Evandale
judged it best to draw off from the conflict without the gates, and,
abandoning to the enemy all the exterior defences of the avenue, confine
themselves to the Castle itself, for fear of its being surprised on some
unguarded point.Their retreat was unmolested; for the panic of Cuddie
and his companions had occasioned nearly as much confusion on the side
of the besiegers, as the screams of Jenny had caused to the defenders.There was no attempt on either side to renew the action that day.The
insurgents had suffered most severely; and, from the difficulty which
they had experienced in carrying the barricadoed positions without the
precincts of the Castle, they could have but little hope of storming the
place itself.On the other hand, the situation of the besieged was
dispiriting and gloomy.In the skirmishing they had lost two or three
men, and had several wounded; and though their loss was in proportion
greatly less than that of the enemy, who had left twenty men dead on the
place, yet their small number could much worse spare it, while the
desperate attacks of the opposite party plainly showed how serious the
leaders were in the purpose of reducing the place, and how well seconded
by the zeal of their followers.But, especially, the garrison had to fear
for hunger, in case blockade should be resorted to as the means of
reducing them.The Major's directions had been imperfectly obeyed in
regard to laying in provisions; and the dragoons, in spite of all warning
and authority, were likely to be wasteful in using them.It was,
therefore, with a heavy heart, that Major Bellenden gave directions for
guarding the window through which the Castle had so nearly been
surprised, as well as all others which offered the most remote facility
for such an enterprise.CHAPTER V.

               The King hath drawn
               The special head of all the land together.The leaders of the presbyterian army had a serious consultation upon the
evening of the day in which they had made the attack on Tillietudlem.They could not but observe that their followers were disheartened by the
loss which they had sustained, and which, as usual in such cases, had
fallen upon the bravest and most forward.It was to be feared, that if
they were suffered to exhaust their zeal and efforts in an object so
secondary as the capture of this petty fort, their numbers would melt
away by degrees, and they would lose all the advantages arising out of
the present unprepared state of the government.Moved by these arguments,
it was agreed that the main body of the army should march against
Glasgow, and dislodge the soldiers who were lying in that town.The
council nominated Henry Morton, with others, to this last service, and
appointed Burley to the command of a chosen body of five hundred men, who
were to remain behind, for the purpose of blockading the Tower of
Tillietudlem.Morton testified the greatest repugnance to this
arrangement."He had the strongest personal motives," he said, "for desiring to remain
near Tillietudlem; and if the management of the siege were committed to
him, he had little doubt but that he would bring it to such an
accommodation, as, without being rigorous to the besieged, would fully
answer the purpose of the besiegers."Burley readily guessed the cause of his young colleague's reluctance to
move with the army; for, interested as he was in appreciating the
characters with whom he had to deal, he had contrived, through the
simplicity of Cuddie, and the enthusiasm of old Mause, to get much
information concerning Morton's relations with the family of
Tillietudlem.He therefore took the advantage of Poundtext's arising to
speak to business, as he said, for some short space of time, (which
Burley rightly interpreted to mean an hour at the very least), and seized
that moment to withdraw Morton from the hearing of their colleagues, and
to hold the following argument with him:

"Thou art unwise, Henry Morton, to desire to sacrifice this holy cause to
thy friendship for an uncircumcised Philistine, or thy lust for a
Moabitish woman.""I neither understand your meaning, Mr Balfour, nor relish your
allusions," replied Morton, indignantly; "and I know no reason you have
to bring so gross a charge, or to use such uncivil language.""Confess, however, the truth," said Balfour, "and own that there are
those within yon dark Tower, over whom thou wouldst rather be watching
like a mother over her little ones, than thou wouldst bear the banner of
the Church of Scotland over the necks of her enemies.""If you mean, that I would willingly terminate this war without any
bloody victory, and that I am more anxious to do this than to acquire any
personal fame or power, you may be," replied Morton, "perfectly right.""And not wholly wrong," answered Burley, "in deeming that thou wouldst
not exclude from so general a pacification thy friends in the garrison of
Tillietudlem.""Certainly," replied Morton; "I am too much obliged to Major Bellenden
not to wish to be of service to him, as far as the interest of the cause
I have espoused will permit.I never made a secret of my regard for him.""I am aware of that," said Burley; "but, if thou hadst concealed it, I
should, nevertheless, have found out thy riddle.Now, hearken to my
words.This Miles Bellenden hath means to subsist his garrison for a
month.""This is not the case," answered Morton; "we know his stores are hardly
equal to a week's consumption.""Ay, but," continued Burley, "I have since had proof, of the strongest
nature, that such a report was spread in the garrison by that wily and
grey-headed malignant, partly to prevail on the soldiers to submit to a
diminution of their daily food, partly to detain us before the walls of
his fortress until the sword should be whetted to smite and destroy us.""And why was not the evidence of this laid before the council of war?""Why need we undeceive Kettledrummle,
Macbriar, Poundtext, and Langcale, upon such a point?Thyself must own,
that whatever is told to them escapes to the host out of the mouth of the
preachers at their next holding-forth.They are already discouraged by
the thoughts of lying before the fort a week.What would be the
consequence were they ordered to prepare for the leaguer of a month?""But why conceal it, then, from me?and, above
all, what proofs have you got of the fact?""There are many proofs," replied Burley; and he put into his hands a
number of requisitions sent forth by Major Bellenden, with receipts on
the back to various proprietors, for cattle, corn, meal, to such an
amount, that the sum total seemed to exclude the possibility of the
garrison being soon distressed for provisions.But Burley did not inform
Morton of a fact which he himself knew full well, namely, that most of
these provisions never reached the garrison, owing to the rapacity of the
dragoons sent to collect them, who readily sold to one man what they took
from another, and abused the Major's press for stores, pretty much as Sir
John Falstaff did that of the King for men."And now," continued Balfour, observing that he had made the desired
impression, "I have only to say, that I concealed this from thee no
longer than it was concealed from myself, for I have only received these
papers this morning; and I tell it unto thee now, that thou mayest go on
thy way rejoicing, and work the great work willingly at Glasgow, being
assured that no evil can befall thy friends in the malignant party, since
their fort is abundantly victualled, and I possess not numbers sufficient
to do more against them than to prevent their sallying forth.""And why," continued Morton, who felt an inexpressible reluctance to
acquiesce in Balfour's reasoning--"why not permit me to remain in the
command of this smaller party, and march forward yourself to Glasgow?"And therefore, young man," answered Burley, "have I laboured that it
should be committed to the son of Silas Morton.I am waxing old, and this
grey head has had enough of honour where it could be gathered by danger.I speak not of the frothy bubble which men call earthly fame, but the
honour belonging to him that doth not the work negligently.But thy
career is yet to run.Thou hast to vindicate the high trust which has
been bestowed on thee through my assurance that it was dearly
well-merited.At Loudon-hill thou wert a captive, and at the last assault
it was thy part to fight under cover, whilst I led the more open and
dangerous attack; and, shouldst thou now remain before these walls when
there is active service elsewhere, trust me, that men will say, that the
son of Silas Morton hath fallen away from the paths of his father."Stung by this last observation, to which, as a gentleman and soldier, he
could offer no suitable reply, Morton hastily acquiesced in the proposed
arrangement.Yet he was unable to divest himself of certain feelings of
distrust which he involuntarily attached to the quarter from which he
received this information."Mr Balfour," he said, "let us distinctly understand each other.You have
thought it worth your while to bestow particular attention upon my
private affairs and personal attachments; be so good as to understand,
that I am as constant to them as to my political principles.It is
possible, that, during my absence, you may possess the power of soothing
or of wounding those feelings.Be assured, that whatever may be the
consequences to the issue of our present adventure, my eternal gratitude,
or my persevering resentment, will attend the line of conduct you may
adopt on such an occasion; and, however young and inexperienced I am, I
have no doubt of finding friends to assist me in expressing my sentiments
in either case.""If there be a threat implied in that denunciation," replied Burley,
coldly and haughtily, "it had better have been spared.I know how to
value the regard of my friends, and despise, from my soul, the threats of
my enemies.Whatever happens
here in your absence shall be managed with as much deference to your
wishes, as the duty I owe to a higher power can possibly permit."With this qualified promise Morton was obliged to rest satisfied."Our defeat will relieve the garrison," said he, internally, "ere they
can be reduced to surrender at discretion; and, in case of victory, I
already see, from the numbers of the moderate party, that I shall have a
voice as powerful as Burley's in determining the use which shall be made
of it."He therefore followed Balfour to the council, where they found
Kettledrummle adding to his lastly a few words of practical application.When these were expended, Morton testified his willingness to accompany
the main body of the army, which was destined to drive the regular troops
from Glasgow.His companions in command were named, and the whole
received a strengthening exhortation from the preachers who were present.Next morning, at break of day, the insurgent army broke up from their
encampment, and marched towards Glasgow.It is not our intention to detail at length incidents which may be found
in the history of the period.It is sufficient to say, that Claverhouse
and Lord Ross, learning the superior force which was directed against
them, intrenched, or rather barricadoed themselves, in the centre of the
city, where the town-house and old jail were situated, with the
determination to stand the assault of the insurgents rather than to
abandon the capital of the west of Scotland.The presbyterians made their
attack in two bodies, one of which penetrated into the city in the line
of the College and Cathedral Church, while the other marched up the
Gallowgate, or principal access from the south-east.Both divisions were
led by men of resolution, and behaved with great spirit.But the
advantages of military skill and situation were too great for their
undisciplined valour.Ross and Claverhouse had carefully disposed parties of their soldiers in
houses, at the heads of the streets, and in the entrances of closes, as
they are called, or lanes, besides those who were intrenched behind
breast-works which reached across the streets.The assailants found their
ranks thinned by a fire from invisible opponents, which they had no means
of returning with effect.It was in vain that Morton and other leaders
exposed their persons with the utmost gallantry, and endeavoured to bring
their antagonists to a close action; their followers shrunk from them in
every direction.And yet, though Henry Morton was one of the very last to
retire, and exerted himself in bringing up the rear, maintaining order in
the retreat, and checking every attempt which the enemy made to improve
the advantage they had gained by the repulse, he had still the
mortification to hear many of those in his ranks muttering to each other,
that "this came of trusting to latitudinarian boys; and that, had honest,
faithful Burley led the attack, as he did that of the barricades of
Tillietudlem, the issue would have been as different as might be."It was with burning resentment that Morton heard these reflections thrown
out by the very men who had soonest exhibited signs of discouragement.The unjust reproach, however, had the effect of firing his emulation, and
making him sensible that, engaged as he was in a perilous cause, it was
absolutely necessary that he should conquer or die."I have no retreat," he said to himself."All shall allow--even Major
Bellenden--even Edith--that in courage, at least, the rebel Morton was
not inferior to his father."The condition of the army after the repulse was so undisciplined, and in
such disorganization, that the leaders thought it prudent to draw off
some miles from the city to gain time for reducing them once more into
such order as they were capable of adopting.Recruits, in the meanwhile,
came fast in, more moved by the extreme hardships of their own condition,
and encouraged by the advantage obtained at Loudon-hill, than deterred by
the last unfortunate enterprise.Many of these attached themselves
particularly to Morton's division.He had, however, the mortification to
see that his unpopularity among the more intolerant part of the
Covenanters increased rapidly.The prudence beyond his years, which he
exhibited in improving the discipline and arrangement of his followers,
they termed a trusting in the arm of flesh, and his avowed tolerance for
those of religious sentiments and observances different from his own,
obtained him, most unjustly, the nickname of Gallio, who cared for none
of those things.What was worse than these misconceptions, the mob of the
insurgents, always loudest in applause of those who push political or
religious opinions to extremity, and disgusted with such as endeavour to
reduce them to the yoke of discipline, preferred avowedly the more
zealous leaders, in whose ranks enthusiasm in the cause supplied the want
of good order and military subjection, to the restraints which Morton
endeavoured to bring them under.In short, while bearing the principal
burden of command, (for his colleagues willingly relinquished in his
favour every thing that was troublesome and obnoxious in the office of
general,) Morton found himself without that authority, which alone could
render his regulations effectual.[Note: These feuds, which tore to
pieces the little army of insurgents, turned merely on the point whether
the king's interest or royal authority was to be owned or not, and
whether the party in arms were to be contented with a free exercise of
their own religion, or insist upon the re-establishment of Presbytery in
its supreme authority, and with full power to predominate over all other
forms of worship.The few country gentlemen who joined the insurrection,
with the most sensible part of the clergy, thought it best to limit their
demands to what it might be possible to attain.But the party who urged
these moderate views were termed by the more zealous bigots, the Erastian
party, men, namely, who were willing to place the church under the
influence of the civil government, and therefore they accounted them, "a
snare upon Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor."See the Life of Sir
Robert Hamilton in the Scottish Worthies, and his account of the Battle
of Both-well-bridge, passim.]Yet, notwithstanding these obstacles, he had, during the course of a few
days, laboured so hard to introduce some degree of discipline into the
army, that he thought he might hazard a second attack upon Glasgow with
every prospect of success.It cannot be doubted that Morton's anxiety to measure himself with
Colonel Grahame of Claverhouse, at whose hands he had sustained such
injury, had its share in giving motive to his uncommon exertions.But
Claverhouse disappointed his hopes; for, satisfied with having the
advantage in repulsing the first attack upon Glasgow, he determined that
he would not, with the handful of troops under his command, await a
second assault from the insurgents, with more numerous and better
disciplined forces than had supported their first enterprise.He
therefore evacuated the place, and marched at the head of his troops
towards Edinburgh.The insurgents of course entered Glasgow without
resistance, and without Morton having the opportunity, which he so deeply
coveted, of again encountering Claverhouse personally.But, although he
had not an opportunity of wiping away the disgrace which had befallen his
division of the army of the Covenant, the retreat of Claverhouse, and the
possession of Glasgow, tended greatly to animate the insurgent army, and
to increase its numbers.The necessity of appointing new officers, of
organizing new regiments and squadrons, of making them acquainted with at
least the most necessary points of military discipline, were labours,
which, by universal consent, seemed to be devolved upon Henry Morton, and
which he the more readily undertook, because his father had made him
acquainted with the theory of the military art, and because he plainly
saw, that, unless he took this ungracious but absolutely necessary
labour, it was vain to expect any other to engage in it.In the meanwhile, fortune appeared to favour the enterprise of the
insurgents more than the most sanguine durst have expected.The Privy
Council of Scotland, astonished at the extent of resistance which their
arbitrary measures had provoked, seemed stupified with terror, and
incapable of taking active steps to subdue the resentment which these
measures had excited.There were but very few troops in Scotland, and
these they drew towards Edinburgh, as if to form an army for protection
of the metropolis.The feudal array of the crown vassals in the various
counties, was ordered to take the field, and render to the King the
military service due for their fiefs.But the summons was very slackly
obeyed.The quarrel was not generally popular among the gentry; and even
those who were not unwilling themselves to have taken arms, were deterred
by the repugnance of their wives, mothers, and sisters, to their engaging
in such a cause.Meanwhile, the inadequacy of the Scottish government to provide for their
own defence, or to put down a rebellion of which the commencement seemed
so trifling, excited at the English court doubts at once of their
capacity, and of the prudence of the severities they had exerted against
the oppressed presbyterians.It was, therefore, resolved to nominate to
the command of the army of Scotland, the unfortunate Duke of Monmouth,
who had by marriage a great interest, large estate, and a numerous
following, as it was called, in the southern parts of that kingdom.The
military skill which he had displayed on different occasions abroad, was
supposed more than adequate to subdue the insurgents in the field; while
it was expected that his mild temper, and the favourable disposition
which he showed to presbyterians in general, might soften men's minds,
and tend to reconcile them to the government.The Duke was, therefore,
invested with a commission, containing high powers for settling the
distracted affairs of Scotland, and dispatched from London with strong
succours to take the principal military command in that country.I am bound to Bothwell-hill,
                    Where I maun either do or die.[Illustration: The Battle of Bothwell Bridge--128


There was now a pause in the military movements on both sides.The
government seemed contented to prevent the rebels advancing towards the
capital, while the insurgents were intent upon augmenting and
strengthening their forces.For this purpose, they established a sort of
encampment in the park belonging to the ducal residence at Hamilton, a
centrical situation for receiving their recruits, and where they were
secured from any sudden attack, by having the Clyde, a deep and rapid
river, in front of their position, which is only passable by a long and
narrow bridge, near the castle and village of Bothwell.Morton remained here for about a fortnight after the attack on Glasgow,
actively engaged in his military duties.He had received more than one
communication from Burley, but they only stated, in general, that the
Castle of Tillietudlem continued to hold out.Impatient of suspense upon
this most interesting subject, he at length intimated to his colleagues
in command his desire, or rather his intention,--for he saw no reason why
he should not assume a license which was taken by every one else in this
disorderly army,--to go to Milnwood for a day or two to arrange some
private affairs of consequence.The proposal was by no means approved of;
for the military council of the insurgents were sufficiently sensible of
the value of his services to fear to lose them, and felt somewhat
conscious of their own inability to supply his place.They could not,
however, pretend to dictate to him laws more rigid than they submitted to
themselves, and he was suffered to depart on his journey without any
direct objection being stated.The Reverend Mr Poundtext took the same
opportunity to pay a visit to his own residence in the neighbourhood of
Milnwood, and favoured Morton with his company on the journey.As the
country was chiefly friendly to their cause, and in possession of their
detached parties, excepting here and there the stronghold of some old
cavaliering Baron, they travelled without any other attendant than the
faithful Cuddie.It was near sunset when they reached Milnwood, where Poundtext bid adieu
to his companions, and travelled forward alone to his own manse, which
was situated half a mile's march beyond Tillietudlem.When Morton was
left alone to his own reflections, with what a complication of feelings
did he review the woods, banks, and fields, that had been familiar to
him!His character, as well as his habits, thoughts, and occupations, had
been entirely changed within the space of little more than a fortnight,
and twenty days seemed to have done upon him the work of as many years.A
mild, romantic, gentle-tempered youth, bred up in dependence, and
stooping patiently to the control of a sordid and tyrannical relation,
had suddenly, by the rod of oppression and the spur of injured feeling,
been compelled to stand forth a leader of armed men, was earnestly
engaged in affairs of a public nature, had friends to animate and enemies
to contend with, and felt his individual fate bound up in that of a
national insurrection and revolution.It seemed as if he had at once
experienced a transition from the romantic dreams of youth to the labours
and cares of active manhood.All that had formerly interested him was
obliterated from his memory, excepting only his attachment to Edith; and
even his love seemed to have assumed a character more manly and
disinterested, as it had become mingled and contrasted with other duties
and feelings.As he revolved the particulars of this sudden change, the
circumstances in which it originated, and the possible consequences of
his present career, the thrill of natural anxiety which passed along his
mind was immediately banished by a glow of generous and high-spirited
confidence."I shall fall young," he said, "if fall I must, my motives misconstrued,
and my actions condemned, by those whose approbation is dearest to me.But the sword of liberty and patriotism is in my hand, and I will neither
fall meanly nor unavenged.They may expose my body, and gibbet my limbs;
but other days will come, when the sentence of infamy will recoil against
those who may pronounce it.And that Heaven, whose name is so often
profaned during this unnatural war, will bear witness to the purity of
the motives by which I have been guided."Upon approaching Milnwood, Henry's knock upon the gate no longer
intimated the conscious timidity of a stripling who has been out of
bounds, but the confidence of a man in full possession of his own rights,
and master of his own actions,--bold, free, and decided.The door was
cautiously opened by his old acquaintance, Mrs Alison Wilson, who started
back when she saw the steel cap and nodding plume of the martial visitor."In troth, ye
garr'd my heart loup to my very mouth--But it canna be your ainsell, for
ye look taller and mair manly-like than ye used to do.""It is, however, my own self," said Henry, sighing and smiling at the
same time; "I believe this dress may make me look taller, and these
times, Ailie, make men out of boys."echoed the old woman; "and O that you suld be
endangered wi'them!but wha can help it?--ye were ill eneugh guided, and,
as I tell your uncle, if ye tread on a worm it will turn.""You were always my advocate, Ailie," said he, and the housekeeper no
longer resented the familiar epithet, "and would let no one blame me but
yourself, I am aware of that,--Where is my uncle?""In Edinburgh," replied Alison; "the honest man thought it was best to
gang and sit by the chimley when the reek rase--a vex'd man he's been and
a feared--but ye ken the Laird as weel as I do.""I hope he has suffered nothing in health?""Naething to speak of," answered the housekeeper, "nor in gudes
neither--we fended as weel as we could; and, though the troopers of
Tillietudlem took the red cow and auld Hackie, (ye'll mind them weel;)
yet they sauld us a gude bargain o' four they were driving to the
Castle.""Ou, they cam out to gather marts for the garrison," answered the
housekeeper; "but they just fell to their auld trade, and rade through
the country couping and selling a' that they gat, like sae mony
west-country drovers.My certie, Major Bellenden was laird o' the least
share o' what they lifted, though it was taen in his name.""Then," said Morton, hastily, "the garrison must be straitened for
provisions?""Stressed eneugh," replied Ailie--"there's little doubt o' that.""Burley must have deceived me--craft as well as cruelty is permitted by
his creed."Such was his inward thought; he said aloud, "I cannot stay,
Mrs Wilson, I must go forward directly."bide to eat a mouthfu'," entreated the affectionate
housekeeper, "and I'll mak it ready for you as I used to do afore thae
sad days," "It is impossible," answered Morton.--"Cuddie, get our horses
ready.""They're just eating their corn," answered the attendant.exclaimed Ailie; "what garr'd ye bring that ill-faur'd, unlucky
loon alang wi' ye?--It was him and his randie mother began a' the
mischief in this house.""Tut, tut," replied Cuddie, "ye should forget and forgie, mistress.Mither's in Glasgow wi' her tittie, and sall plague ye nae mair; and I'm
the Captain's wallie now, and I keep him tighter in thack and rape than
ever ye did;--saw ye him ever sae weel put on as he is now?""In troth and that's true," said the old housekeeper, looking with great
complacency at her young master, whose mien she thought much improved by
his dress."I'm sure ye ne'er had a laced cravat like that when ye were
at Milnwood; that's nane o' my sewing.""Na, na, mistress," replied Cuddie, "that's a cast o' my hand--that's ane
o' Lord Evandale's braws."answered the old lady, "that's him that the whigs are
gaun to hang the morn, as I hear say.""The whigs about to hang Lord Evandale?"said Morton, in the greatest
surprise."Ay, troth are they," said the housekeeper."Yesterday night he made a
sally, as they ca't, (my mother's name was Sally--I wonder they gie
Christian folk's names to sic unchristian doings,)--but he made an
outbreak to get provisions, and his men were driven back and he was taen,
'an' the whig Captain Balfour garr'd set up a gallows, and swore, (or
said upon his conscience, for they winna swear,) that if the garrison was
not gien ower the morn by daybreak, he would hing up the young lord, poor
thing, as high as Haman.--These are sair times!--but folk canna help
them--sae do ye sit down and tak bread and cheese until better meat's
made ready.Ye suldna hae kend a word about it, an I had thought it was
to spoil your dinner, hinny.""Fed, or unfed," exclaimed Morton, "saddle the horses instantly, Cuddie.We must not rest until we get before the Castle."And, resisting all Ailie's entreaties, they instantly resumed their
journey.Morton failed not to halt at the dwelling of Poundtext, and summon him to
attend him to the camp.That honest divine had just resumed for an
instant his pacific habits, and was perusing an ancient theological
treatise, with a pipe in his mouth, and a small jug of ale beside him, to
assist his digestion of the argument.It was with bitter ill-will that he
relinquished these comforts (which he called his studies) in order to
recommence a hard ride upon a high-trotting horse.However, when he knew
the matter in hand, he gave up, with a deep groan, the prospect of
spending a quiet evening in his own little parlour; for he entirely
agreed with Morton, that whatever interest Burley might have in rendering
the breach between the presbyterians and the government irreconcilable,
by putting the young nobleman to death, it was by no means that of the
moderate party to permit such an act of atrocity.And it is but doing
justice to Mr Poundtext to add, that, like most of his own persuasion, he
was decidedly adverse to any such acts of unnecessary violence; besides,
that his own present feelings induced him to listen with much complacence
to the probability held out by Morton, of Lord Evandale's becoming a
mediator for the establishment of peace upon fair and moderate terms.With this similarity of views, they hastened their journey, and arrived
about eleven o'clock at night at a small hamlet adjacent to the Castle at
Tillietudlem, where Burley had established his head-quarters.They were challenged by the sentinel, who made his melancholy walk at the
entrance of the hamlet, and admitted upon declaring their names and
authority in the army.Another soldier kept watch before a house, which
they conjectured to be the place of Lord Evandale's confinement, for a
gibbet of such great height as to be visible from the battlements of the
Castle, was erected before it, in melancholy confirmation of the truth of
Mrs Wilson's report.[Note: The Cameronians had suffered persecution, but
it was without learning mercy.We are informed by Captain Crichton, that
they had set up in their camp a huge gibbet, or gallows, having many
hooks upon it, with a coil of new ropes lying beside it, for the
execution of such royalists as they might make prisoners.Guild, in his
Bellum Bothuellianum, describes this machine particularly.]Morton
instantly demanded to speak with Burley, and was directed to his
quarters.They found him reading the Scriptures, with his arms lying
beside him, as if ready for any sudden alarm.He started upon the
entrance of his colleagues in office."Is there bad news
from the army?""No," replied Morton; "but we understand that there are measures adopted
here in which the safety of the army is deeply concerned--Lord Evandale
is your prisoner?""The Lord," replied Burley, "hath delivered him into our hands.""And you will avail yourself of that advantage, granted you by Heaven, to
dishonour our cause in the eyes of all the world, by putting a prisoner
to an ignominious death?""If the house of Tillietudlem be not surrendered by daybreak," replied
Burley, "God do so to me and more also, if he shall not die that death to
which his leader and patron, John Grahame of Claverhouse, hath put so
many of God's saints.""We are in arms," replied Morton, "to put down such cruelties, and not to
imitate them, far less to avenge upon the innocent the acts of the
guilty.By what law can you justify the atrocity you would commit?""If thou art ignorant of it," replied Burley, "thy companion is well
aware of the law which gave the men of Jericho to the sword of Joshua,
the son of Nun.""But we," answered the divine, "live under a better dispensation, which
instructeth us to return good for evil, and to pray for those who
despitefully use us and persecute us.""That is to say," said Burley, "that thou wilt join thy grey hairs to his
green youth to controvert me in this matter?""We are," rejoined Poundtext, "two of those to whom, jointly with
thyself, authority is delegated over this host, and we will not permit
thee to hurt a hair of the prisoner's head.It may please God to make him
a means of healing these unhappy breaches in our Israel.""I judged it would come to this," answered Burley, "when such as thou
wert called into the council of the elders."answered Poundtext,--"And who am I, that you should name me
with such scorn?--Have I not kept the flock of this sheep-fold from the
wolves for thirty years?Ay, even while thou, John Balfour, wert fighting
in the ranks of uncircumcision, a Philistine of hardened brow and bloody
hand--Who am I, say'st thou?""I will tell thee what thou art, since thou wouldst so fain know," said
Burley."Thou art one of those, who would reap where thou hast not sowed,
and divide the spoil while others fight the battle--thou art one of those
that follow the gospel for the loaves and for the fishes--that love their
own manse better than the Church of God, and that would rather draw their
stipends under prelatists or heathens, than be a partaker with those
noble spirits who have cast all behind them for the sake of the
Covenant.""And I will tell thee, John Balfour," returned Poundtext, deservedly
incensed, "I will tell thee what thou art.Thou art one of those, for
whose bloody and merciless disposition a reproach is flung upon the whole
church of this suffering kingdom, and for whose violence and
blood-guiltiness, it is to be feared, this fair attempt to recover our
civil and religious rights will never be honoured by Providence with the
desired success.""Gentlemen," said Morton, "cease this irritating and unavailing
recrimination; and do you, Mr Balfour, inform us, whether it is your
purpose to oppose the liberation of Lord Evandale, which appears to us a
profitable measure in the present position of our affairs?""You are here," answered Burley, "as two voices against one; but you will
not refuse to tarry until the united council shall decide upon this
matter?""This," said Morton, "we would not decline, if we could trust the hands
in whom we are to leave the prisoner.--But you know well," he added,
looking sternly at Burley, "that you have already deceived me in this
matter.""Go to," said Burley, disdainfully,--"thou art an idle inconsiderate boy,
who, for the black eyebrows of a silly girl, would barter thy own faith
and honour, and the cause of God and of thy country.""Mr Balfour," said Morton, laying his hand on his sword, "this language
requires satisfaction.""And thou shalt have it, stripling, when and where thou darest," said
Burley; "I plight thee my good word on it."Poundtext, in his turn, interfered to remind them of the madness of
quarrelling, and effected with difficulty a sort of sullen
reconciliation."Concerning the prisoner," said Burley, "deal with him as ye think fit.I
wash my hands free from all consequences.He is my prisoner, made by my
sword and spear, while you, Mr Morton, were playing the adjutant at
drills and parades, and you, Mr Poundtext, were warping the Scriptures
into Erastianism.Take him unto you, nevertheless, and dispose of him as
ye think meet.--Dingwall," he continued, calling a sort of aid-de-camp,
who slept in the next apartment, "let the guard posted on the malignant
Evandale give up their post to those whom Captain Morton shall appoint to
relieve them.--The prisoner," he said, again addressing Poundtext and
Morton, "is now at your disposal, gentlemen.But remember, that for all
these things there will one day come a term of heavy accounting."So saying, he turned abruptly into an inner apartment, without bidding
them good evening.His two visitors, after a moment's consideration,
agreed it would be prudent to ensure the prisoner's personal safety, by
placing over him an additional guard, chosen from their own parishioners.A band of them happened to be stationed in the hamlet, having been
attached, for the time, to Burley's command, in order that the men might
be gratified by remaining as long as possible near to their own homes.They were, in general, smart, active young fellows, and were usually
called by their companions, the Marksmen of Milnwood.By Morton's desire,
four of these lads readily undertook the task of sentinels, and he left
with them Headrigg, on whose fidelity he could depend, with instructions
to call him, if any thing remarkable happened.This arrangement being made, Morton and his colleague took possession,
for the night, of such quarters as the over-crowded and miserable hamlet
could afford them.They did not, however, separate for repose till they
had drawn up a memorial of the grievances of the moderate presbyterians,
which was summed up with a request of free toleration for their religion
in future, and that they should be permitted to attend gospel ordinances
as dispensed by their own clergymen, without oppression or molestation.Their petition proceeded to require that a free parliament should be
called for settling the affairs of church and state, and for redressing
the injuries sustained by the subject; and that all those who either now
were, or had been, in arms, for obtaining these ends, should be
indemnified.Morton could not but strongly hope that these terms, which
comprehended all that was wanted, or wished for, by the moderate party
among the insurgents, might, when thus cleared of the violence of
fanaticism, find advocates even among the royalists, as claiming only the
ordinary rights of Scottish freemen.He had the more confidence of a favourable reception, that the Duke of
Monmouth, to whom Charles had intrusted the charge of subduing this
rebellion, was a man of gentle, moderate, and accessible disposition,
well known to be favourable to the presbyterians, and invested by the
king with full powers to take measures for quieting the disturbances in
Scotland.It seemed to Morton, that all that was necessary for
influencing him in their favour was to find a fit and sufficiently
respectable channel of communication, and such seemed to be opened
through the medium of Lord Evandale.He resolved, therefore, to visit the
prisoner early in the morning, in order to sound his dispositions to
undertake the task of mediator; but an accident happened which led him to
anticipate his purpose.Gie ower your house, lady, he said,--
                    Gie ower your house to me.Morton had finished the revisal and the making out of a fair copy of the
paper on which he and Poundtext had agreed to rest as a full statement of
the grievances of their party, and the conditions on which the greater
part of the insurgents would be contented to lay down their arms; and he
was about to betake himself to repose, when there was a knocking at the
door of his apartment."Enter," said Morton; and the round bullethead of Cuddie Headrigg was
thrust into the room."Come in," said Morton, "and tell me what you want."Na, stir; but I hae brought ane to speak wi' you.""Ane o' your auld acquaintance," said Cuddie; and, opening the door more
fully, he half led, half dragged in a woman, whose face was muffled in
her plaid.--"Come, come, ye needna be sae bashfu' before auld
acquaintance, Jenny," said Cuddie, pulling down the veil, and discovering
to his master the well-remembered countenance of Jenny Dennison."Tell
his honour, now--there's a braw lass--tell him what ye were wanting to
say to Lord Evandale, mistress.""What was I wanting to say," answered Jenny, "to his honour himsell the
other morning, when I visited him in captivity, ye muckle hash?--D'ye
think that folk dinna want to see their friends in adversity, ye dour
crowdy-eater?"This reply was made with Jenny's usual volubility; but her voice
quivered, her cheek was thin and pale, the tears stood in her eyes, her
hand trembled, her manner was fluttered, and her whole presence bore
marks of recent suffering and privation, as well as nervous and
hysterical agitation."You know how much I
owe you in many respects, and can hardly make a request that I will not
grant, if in my power.""Many thanks, Milnwood," said the weeping damsel; "but ye were aye a kind
gentleman, though folk say ye hae become sair changed now.""A' body says," replied Jenny, "that you and the whigs hae made a vow to
ding King Charles aff the throne, and that neither he, nor his posteriors
from generation to generation, shall sit upon it ony mair; and John
Gudyill threeps ye're to gie a' the church organs to the pipers, and burn
the Book o' Common-prayer by the hands of the common hangman, in revenge
of the Covenant that was burnt when the king cam hame.""My friends at Tillietudlem judge too hastily and too ill of me,"
answered Morton."I wish to have free exercise of my own religion,
without insulting any other; and as to your family, I only desire an
opportunity to show them I have the same friendship and kindness as
ever.""Bless your kind heart for saying sae," said Jenny, bursting into a flood
of tears; "and they never needed kindness or friendship mair, for they
are famished for lack o' food."replied Morton, "I have heard of scarcity, but not of famine!It is possible?--Have the ladies and the Major"--

"They hae suffered like the lave o' us," replied Jenny; "for they shared
every bit and sup wi' the whole folk in the Castle--I'm sure my poor een
see fifty colours wi' faintness, and my head's sae dizzy wi' the
mirligoes that I canna stand my lane."The thinness of the poor girl's cheek, and the sharpness of her features,
bore witness to the truth of what she said."Sit down," he said, "for God's sake!"forcing her into the only chair
the apartment afforded, while he himself strode up and down the room in
horror and impatience."I knew not of this," he exclaimed in broken
ejaculations,--"I could not know of it.--Cold-blooded, iron-hearted
fanatic--deceitful villain!--Cuddie, fetch refreshments--food--wine, if
possible--whatever you can find.""Whisky is gude eneugh for her," muttered Cuddie; "ane wadna hae thought
that gude meal was sae scant amang them, when the quean threw sae muckle
gude kail-brose scalding het about my lugs."Faint and miserable as Jenny seemed to be, she could not hear the
allusion to her exploit during the storm of the Castle, without bursting
into a laugh which weakness soon converted into a hysterical giggle.Confounded at her state, and reflecting with horror on the distress which
must have been in the Castle, Morton repeated his commands to Headrigg in
a peremptory manner; and when he had departed, endeavoured to soothe his
visitor."You come, I suppose, by the orders of your mistress, to visit Lord
Evandale?--Tell me what she desires; her orders shall be my law."Jenny appeared to reflect a moment, and then said, "Your honour is sae
auld a friend, I must needs trust to you, and tell the truth.""Be assured, Jenny," said Morton, observing that she hesitated, "that you
will best serve your mistress by dealing sincerely with me.""Weel, then, ye maun ken we're starving, as I said before, and have been
mair days than ane; and the Major has sworn that he expects relief daily,
and that he will not gie ower the house to the enemy till we have eaten
up his auld boots,--and they are unco thick in the soles, as ye may weel
mind, forby being teugh in the upper-leather.The dragoons, again, they
think they will be forced to gie up at last, and they canna bide hunger
weel, after the life they led at free quarters for this while bypast; and
since Lord Evandale's taen, there's nae guiding them; and Inglis says
he'll gie up the garrison to the whigs, and the Major and the leddies
into the bargain, if they will but let the troopers gang free themsells."said Morton; "why do they not make terms for all in the
Castle?""They are fear'd for denial o' quarter to themsells, having dune sae
muckle mischief through the country; and Burley has hanged ane or twa o'
them already--sae they want to draw their ain necks out o' the collar at
hazard o' honest folk's.""And you were sent," continued Morton, "to carry to Lord Evandale the
unpleasant news of the men's mutiny?""Just e'en sae," said Jenny; "Tam Halliday took the rue, and tauld me a'
about it, and gat me out o' the Castle to tell Lord Evandale, if possibly
I could win at him.""Well-a-day, ay," answered the afflicted damsel; "but maybe he could mak
fair terms for us--or, maybe, he could gie us some good advice--or,
maybe, he might send his orders to the dragoons to be civil--or"--

"Or, maybe," said Morton, "you were to try if it were possible to set him
at liberty?""If it were sae," answered Jenny with spirit, "it wadna be the first time
I hae done my best to serve a friend in captivity.""True, Jenny," replied Morton, "I were most ungrateful to forget it.But
here comes Cuddie with refreshments--I will go and do your errand to Lord
Evandale, while you take some food and wine.""It willna be amiss ye should ken," said Cuddie to his master, "that this
Jenny--this Mrs Dennison, was trying to cuittle favour wi' Tam Rand, the
miller's man, to win into Lord Evandale's room without ony body kennin'.She wasna thinking, the gipsy, that I was at her elbow.""And an unco fright ye gae me when ye cam ahint and took a grip o' me,"
said Jenny, giving him a sly twitch with her finger and her thumb--"if ye
hadna been an auld acquaintance, ye daft gomeril"--

Cuddie, somewhat relenting, grinned a smile on his artful mistress, while
Morton wrapped himself up in his cloak, took his sword under his arm, and
went straight to the place of the young nobleman's confinement.He asked
the sentinels if any thing extraordinary had occurred."Nothing worth notice," they said, "excepting the lass that Cuddie took
up, and two couriers that Captain Balfour had dispatched, one to the
Reverend Ephraim Macbriar, another to Kettledrummle," both of whom were
beating the drum ecclesiastic in different towns between the position of
Burley and the head-quarters of the main army near Hamilton."The purpose, I presume," said Morton, with an affectation of
indifference, "was to call them hither.""So I understand," answered the sentinel, who had spoke with the
messengers.He is summoning a triumphant majority of the council, thought Morton to
himself, for the purpose of sanctioning whatever action of atrocity he
may determine upon, and thwarting opposition by authority.I must be
speedy, or I shall lose my opportunity.When he entered the place of Lord Evandale's confinement, he found him
ironed, and reclining on a flock bed in the wretched garret of a
miserable cottage.He was either in a slumber, or in deep meditation,
when Morton entered, and turned on him, when aroused, a countenance so
much reduced by loss of blood, want of sleep, and scarcity of food, that
no one could have recognised in it the gallant soldier who had behaved
with so much spirit at the skirmish of Loudon-hill.He displayed some
surprise at the sudden entrance of Morton."I am sorry to see you thus, my lord," said that youthful leader."I have heard you are an admirer of poetry," answered the prisoner; "in
that case, Mr Morton, you may remember these lines,--

              'Stone walls do not a prison make,
               Or iron bars a cage;
               A free and quiet mind can take
               These for a hermitage.'But, were my imprisonment less endurable, I am given to expect to-morrow
a total enfranchisement.""Surely," answered Lord Evandale; "I have no other prospect.Your
comrade, Burley, has already dipped his hand in the blood of men whose
meanness of rank and obscurity of extraction might have saved them.I
cannot boast such a shield from his vengeance, and I expect to meet its
extremity.""But Major Bellenden," said Morton, "may surrender, in order to preserve
your life.""Never, while there is one man to defend the battlement, and that man has
one crust to eat.I know his gallant resolution, and grieved should I be
if he changed it for my sake."Morton hastened to acquaint him with the mutiny among the dragoons, and
their resolution to surrender the Castle, and put the ladies of the
family, as well as the Major, into the hands of the enemy.Lord Evandale
seemed at first surprised, and something incredulous, but immediately
afterwards deeply affected.he said--"How is this misfortune to be averted?""Hear me, my lord," said Morton."I believe you may not be unwilling to
bear the olive branch between our master the King, and that part of his
subjects which is now in arms, not from choice, but necessity.""You construe me but justly," said Lord Evandale; "but to what does this
tend?""Permit me, my lord"--continued Morton."I will set you at liberty upon
parole; nay, you may return to the Castle, and shall have a safe conduct
for the ladies, the Major, and all who leave it, on condition of its
instant surrender.In contributing to bring this about you will only
submit to circumstances; for, with a mutiny in the garrison, and without
provisions, it will be found impossible to defend the place twenty-four
hours longer.Those, therefore, who refuse to accompany your lordship,
must take their fate.You and your followers shall have a free pass to
Edinburgh, or where-ever the Duke of Monmouth may be.In return for your
liberty, we hope that you will recommend to the notice of his Grace, as
Lieutenant-General of Scotland, this humble petition and remonstrance,
containing the grievances which have occasioned this insurrection, a
redress of which being granted, I will answer with my head, that the
great body of the insurgents will lay down their arms."Lord Evandale read over the paper with attention."Mr Morton," he said, "in my simple judgment, I see little objection that
can be made to the measure here recommended; nay, farther, I believe, in
many respects, they may meet the private sentiments of the Duke of
Monmouth: and yet, to deal frankly with you, I have no hopes of their
being granted, unless, in the first place, you were to lay down your
arms.""The doing so," answered Morton, "would be virtually conceding that we
had no right to take them up; and that, for one, I will never agree to.""Perhaps it is hardly to be expected you should," said Lord Evandale;
"and yet on that point I am certain the negotiations will be wrecked.I
am willing, however, having frankly told you my opinion, to do all in my
power to bring about a reconciliation.""It is all we can wish or expect," replied Morton; "the issue is in God's
hands, who disposes the hearts of princes.--You accept, then, the safe
conduct?""Certainly," answered Lord Evandale; "and if I do not enlarge upon the
obligation incurred by your having saved my life a second time, believe
that I do not feel it the less.""And the garrison of Tillietudlem?""Shall be withdrawn as you propose," answered the young nobleman."I am
sensible the Major will be unable to bring the mutineers to reason; and I
tremble to think of the consequences, should the ladies and the brave old
man be delivered up to this bloodthirsty ruffian, Burley.""You are in that case free," said Morton."Prepare to mount on horseback;
a few men whom I can trust shall attend you till you are in safety from
our parties."Leaving Lord Evandale in great surprise and joy at this unexpected
deliverance, Morton hastened to get a few chosen men under arms and on
horseback, each rider holding the rein of a spare horse.Jenny, who,
while she partook of her refreshment, had contrived to make up her breach
with Cuddie, rode on the left hand of that valiant cavalier.The tramp of
their horses was soon heard under the window of Lord Evandale's prison.Two men, whom he did not know, entered the apartment, disencumbered him
of his fetters, and, conducting him down stairs, mounted him in the
centre of the detachment.They set out at a round trot towards
Tillietudlem.The moonlight was giving way to the dawn when they approached that
ancient fortress, and its dark massive tower had just received the first
pale colouring of the morning.The party halted at the Tower barrier, not
venturing to approach nearer for fear of the fire of the place.Lord
Evandale alone rode up to the gate, followed at a distance by Jenny
Dennison.As they approached the gate, there was heard to arise in the
court-yard a tumult, which accorded ill with the quiet serenity of a
summer dawn.Cries and oaths were heard, a pistol-shot or two were
discharged, and every thing announced that the mutiny had broken out.At
this crisis Lord Evandale arrived at the gate where Halliday was
sentinel.On hearing Lord Evandale's voice, he instantly and gladly
admitted him, and that nobleman arrived among the mutinous troopers like
a man dropped from the clouds.They were in the act of putting their
design into execution, of seizing the place into their own hands, and
were about to disarm and overpower Major Bellenden and Harrison, and
others of the Castle, who were offering the best resistance in their
power.The appearance of Lord Evandale changed the scene.He seized Inglis by
the collar, and, upbraiding him with his villainy, ordered two of his
comrades to seize and bind him, assuring the others, that their only
chance of impunity consisted in instant submission.He then ordered the
men into their ranks.They hesitated; but the instinct of discipline, joined to their
persuasion that the authority of their officer, so boldly exerted, must
be supported by some forces without the gate, induced them to submit."Take away those arms," said Lord Evandale to the people of the Castle;
"they shall not be restored until these men know better the use for which
they are intrusted with them.--And now," he continued, addressing the
mutineers, "begone!--Make the best use of your time, and of a truce of
three hours, which the enemy are contented to allow you.Take the road to
Edinburgh, and meet me at the House-of-Muir.I need not bid you beware of
committing violence by the way; you will not, in your present condition,
provoke resentment for your own sakes.Let your punctuality show that you
mean to atone for this morning's business."The disarmed soldiers shrunk in silence from the presence of their
officer, and, leaving the Castle, took the road to the place of
rendezvous, making such haste as was inspired by the fear of meeting with
some detached party of the insurgents, whom their present defenceless
condition, and their former violence, might inspire with thoughts of
revenge.Inglis, whom Evandale destined for punishment, remained in
custody.Halliday was praised for his conduct, and assured of succeeding
to the rank of the culprit.These arrangements being hastily made, Lord
Evandale accosted the Major, before whose eyes the scene had seemed to
pass like the change of a dream."My dear Major, we must give up the place.""I was in hopes you had brought
reinforcements and supplies.""Not a man--not a pound of meal," answered Lord Evandale."Yet I am blithe to see you," returned the honest Major; "we were
informed yesterday that these psalm-singing rascals had a plot on your
life, and I had mustered the scoundrelly dragoons ten minutes ago in
order to beat up Burley's quarters and get you out of limbo, when the dog
Inglis, instead of obeying me, broke out into open mutiny.--But what is
to be done now?""I have, myself, no choice," said Lord Evandale; "I am a prisoner,
released on parole, and bound for Edinburgh.You and the ladies must take
the same route.I have, by the favour of a friend, a safe conduct and
horses for you and your retinue--for God's sake make haste--you cannot
propose to hold out with seven or eight men, and without provisions--
Enough has been done for honour, and enough to render the defence of the
highest consequence to government.More were needless, as well as
desperate.The English troops are arrived at Edinburgh, and will speedily
move upon Hamilton.The possession of Tillietudlem by the rebels will be
but temporary.""If you think so, my lord," said the veteran, with a reluctant sigh,--"I
know you only advise what is honourable--if, then, you really think the
case inevitable, I must submit; for the mutiny of these scoundrels would
render it impossible to man the walls.--Gudyill, let the women call up
their mistresses, and all be ready to march--But if I could believe that
my remaining in these old walls, till I was starved to a mummy, could do
the King's cause the least service, old Miles Bellenden would not leave
them while there was a spark of life in his body!"The ladies, already alarmed by the mutiny, now heard the determination of
the Major, in which they readily acquiesced, though not without some
groans and sighs on the part of Lady Margaret, which referred, as usual,
to the _dejeune_; of his Most Sacred Majesty in the halls which were now
to be abandoned to rebels.Hasty preparations were made for evacuating
the Castle; and long ere the dawn was distinct enough for discovering
objects with precision, the ladies, with Major Bellenden, Harrison,
Gudyill, and the other domestics, were mounted on the led horses, and
others which had been provided in the neighbourhood, and proceeded
towards the north, still escorted by four of the insurgent horsemen.The
rest of the party who had accompanied Lord Evandale from the hamlet, took
possession of the deserted Castle, carefully forbearing all outrage or
acts of plunder.And when the sun arose, the scarlet and blue colours of
the Scottish Covenant floated from the Keep of Tillietudlem.And, to my breast, a bodkin in her hand
               Were worth a thousand daggers.The cavalcade which left the Castle of Tillietudlem, halted for a few
minutes at the small town of Bothwell, after passing the outposts of the
insurgents, to take some slight refreshments which their attendants had
provided, and which were really necessary to persons who had suffered
considerably by want of proper nourishment.They then pressed forward
upon the road towards Edinburgh, amid the lights of dawn which were now
rising on the horizon.It might have been expected, during the course of
the journey, that Lord Evandale would have been frequently by the side of
Miss Edith Bellenden.Yet, after his first salutations had been
exchanged, and every precaution solicitously adopted which could serve
for her accommodation, he rode in the van of the party with Major
Bellenden, and seemed to abandon the charge of immediate attendance upon
his lovely niece to one of the insurgent cavaliers, whose dark military
cloak, with the large flapped hat and feather, which drooped over his
face, concealed at once his figure and his features.They rode side by
side in silence for more than two miles, when the stranger addressed Miss
Bellenden in a tremulous and suppressed voice."Miss Bellenden," he said, "must have friends wherever she is known; even
among those whose conduct she now disapproves.Is there any thing that
such can do to show their respect for her, and their regret for her
sufferings?""Let them learn for their own sakes," replied Edith, "to venerate the
laws, and to spare innocent blood.Let them return to their allegiance,
and I can forgive them all that I have suffered, were it ten times more.""You think it impossible, then," rejoined the cavalier, "for any one to
serve in our ranks, having the weal of his country sincerely at heart,
and conceiving himself in the discharge of a patriotic duty?""It might be imprudent, while so absolutely in your power," replied Miss
Bellenden, "to answer that question.""Not in the present instance, I plight you the word of a soldier,"
replied the horseman."I have been taught candour from my birth," said Edith; "and, if I am to
speak at all, I must utter my real sentiments.God only can judge the
heart--men must estimate intentions by actions.Treason, murder by the
sword and by gibbet, the oppression of a private family such as ours, who
were only in arms for the defence of the established government, and of
our own property, are actions which must needs sully all that have
accession to them, by whatever specious terms they may be gilded over.""The guilt of civil war," rejoined the horseman--"the miseries which it
brings in its train, lie at the door of those who provoked it by illegal
oppression, rather than of such as are driven to arms in order to assert
their natural rights as freemen.""That is assuming the question," replied Edith, "which ought to be
proved.Each party contends that they are right in point of principle,
and therefore the guilt must lie with them who first drew the sword; as,
in an affray, law holds those to be the criminals who are the first to
have recourse to violence."said the horseman, "were our vindication to rest there, how easy
would it be to show that we have suffered with a patience which almost
seemed beyond the power of humanity, ere we were driven by oppression
into open resistance!--But I perceive," he continued, sighing deeply,
"that it is vain to plead before Miss Bellenden a cause which she has
already prejudged, perhaps as much from her dislike of the persons as of
the principles of those engaged in it.""Pardon me," answered Edith; "I have stated with freedom my opinion
of the principles of the insurgents; of their persons I know
nothing--excepting in one solitary instance.""And that instance," said the horseman, "has influenced your opinion of
the whole body?""Far from it," said Edith; "he is--at least I once thought him--one in
whose scale few were fit to be weighed--he is--or he seemed--one of early
talent, high faith, pure morality, and warm affections.Can I approve of
a rebellion which has made such a man, formed to ornament, to enlighten,
and to defend his country, the companion of gloomy and ignorant fanatics,
or canting hypocrites,--the leader of brutal clowns,--the brother-in-arms
to banditti and highway murderers?--Should you meet such an one in your
camp, tell him that Edith Bellenden has wept more over his fallen
character, blighted prospects, and dishonoured name, than over the
distresses of her own house,--and that she has better endured that famine
which has wasted her cheek and dimmed her eye, than the pang of heart
which attended the reflection by and through whom these calamities were
inflicted."As she thus spoke, she turned upon her companion a countenance, whose
faded cheek attested the reality of her sufferings, even while it glowed
with the temporary animation which accompanied her language.The horseman
was not insensible to the appeal; he raised his hand to his brow with the
sudden motion of one who feels a pang shoot along his brain, passed it
hastily over his face, and then pulled the shadowing hat still deeper on
his forehead.The movement, and the feelings which it excited, did not
escape Edith, nor did she remark them without emotion."And yet," she said, "should the person of whom I speak seem to you too
deeply affected by the hard opinion of--of--an early friend, say to him,
that sincere repentance is next to innocence;--that, though fallen from a
height not easily recovered, and the author of much mischief, because
gilded by his example, he may still atone in some measure for the evil he
has done."asked the cavalier, in the same suppressed, and
almost choked voice."By lending his efforts to restore the blessings of peace to his
distracted countrymen, and to induce the deluded rebels to lay down their
arms.By saving their blood, he may atone for that which has been already
spilt;--and he that shall be most active in accomplishing this great end,
will best deserve the thanks of this age, and an honoured remembrance in
the next.""And in such a peace," said her companion, with a firm voice, "Miss
Bellenden would not wish, I think, that the interests of the people were
sacrificed unreservedly to those of the crown?""I am but a girl," was the young lady's reply; "and I scarce can speak on
the subject without presumption.But, since I have gone so far, I will
fairly add, I would wish to see a peace which should give rest to all
parties, and secure the subjects from military rapine, which I detest as
much as I do the means now adopted to resist it.""Miss Bellenden," answered Henry Morton, raising his face, and speaking
in his natural tone, "the person who has lost such a highly-valued place
in your esteem, has yet too much spirit to plead his cause as a criminal;
and, conscious that he can no longer claim a friend's interest in your
bosom, he would be silent under your hard censure, were it not that he
can refer to the honoured testimony of Lord Evandale, that his earnest
wishes and most active exertions are, even now, directed to the
accomplishment of such a peace as the most loyal cannot censure."He bowed with dignity to Miss Bellenden, who, though her language
intimated that she well knew to whom she had been speaking, probably had
not expected that he would justify himself with so much animation.She
returned his salute, confused and in silence.Morton then rode forward to
the head of the party.exclaimed Major Bellenden, surprised at the sudden
apparition."The same," answered Morton; "who is sorry that he labours under the
harsh construction of Major Bellenden and his family.He commits to my
Lord Evandale," he continued, turning towards the young nobleman, and
bowing to him, "the charge of undeceiving his friends, both regarding the
particulars of his conduct and the purity of his motives.Farewell, Major
Bellenden--All happiness attend you and yours--May we meet again in
happier and better times!""Believe me," said Lord Evandale, "your confidence, Mr Morton, is not
misplaced; I will endeavour to repay the great services I have received
from you by doing my best to place your character on its proper footing
with Major Bellenden, and all whose esteem you value.""I expected no less from your generosity, my lord," said Morton.He then called his followers, and rode off along the heath in the
direction of Hamilton, their feathers waving and their steel caps
glancing in the beams of the rising sun.Cuddie Headrigg alone remained
an instant behind his companions to take an affectionate farewell of
Jenny Dennison, who had contrived, during this short morning's ride, to
re-establish her influence over his susceptible bosom.A straggling tree
or two obscured, rather than concealed, their _tete-a-tete_, as they
halted their horses to bid adieu."Fare ye weel, Jenny," said Cuddie, with a loud exertion of his lungs,
intended perhaps to be a sigh, but rather resembling the intonation of a
groan,--"Ye'll think o' puir Cuddie sometimes--an honest lad that lo'es
ye, Jenny; ye'll think o' him now and then?""Whiles--at brose-time," answered the malicious damsel, unable either to
suppress the repartee, or the arch smile which attended it.[Illustration: Whiles--at Brose-Time--pa098]


Cuddie took his revenge as rustic lovers are wont, and as Jenny probably
expected,--caught his mistress round the neck, kissed her cheeks and lips
heartily, and then turned his horse and trotted after his master."Deil's in the fallow," said Jenny, wiping her lips and adjusting her
head-dress, "he has twice the spunk o' Tam Halliday, after a'.--Coming,
my leddy, coming--Lord have a care o' us, I trust the auld leddy didna
see us!""Jenny," said Lady Margaret, as the damsel came up, "was not that young
man who commanded the party the same that was captain of the popinjay,
and who was afterwards prisoner at Tillietudlem on the morning
Claverhouse came there?"Jenny, happy that the query had no reference to her own little matters,
looked at her young mistress, to discover, if possible, whether it was
her cue to speak truth or not.Not being able to catch any hint to guide
her, she followed her instinct as a lady's maid, and lied."I dinna believe it was him, my leddy," said Jenny, as confidently as if
she had been saying her catechism; "he was a little black man, that.""You must have been blind, Jenny," said the Major: "Henry Morton is tall
and fair, and that youth is the very man.""I had ither thing ado than be looking at him," said Jenny, tossing her
head; "he may be as fair as a farthing candle, for me.""Is it not," said Lady Margaret, "a blessed escape which we have made,
out of the hands of so desperate and bloodthirsty a fanatic?""You are deceived, madam," said Lord Evandale; "Mr Morton merits such a
title from no one, but least from us.That I am now alive, and that you
are now on your safe retreat to your friends, instead of being prisoners
to a real fanatical homicide, is solely and entirely owing to the prompt,
active, and energetic humanity of this young gentleman."He then went into a particular narrative of the events with which the
reader is acquainted, dwelling upon the merits of Morton, and expatiating
on the risk at which he had rendered them these important services, as if
he had been a brother instead of a rival."I were worse than ungrateful," he said, "were I silent on the merits of
the man who has twice saved my life.""I would willingly think well of Henry Morton, my lord," replied Major
Bellenden; "and I own he has behaved handsomely to your lordship and to
us; but I cannot have the same allowances which it pleases your lordship
to entertain for his present courses.""You are to consider," replied Lord Evandale, "that he has been partly
forced upon them by necessity; and I must add, that his principles,
though differing in some degree from my own, are such as ought to command
respect.Claverhouse, whose knowledge of men is not to be disputed, spoke
justly of him as to his extraordinary qualities, but with prejudice, and
harshly, concerning his principles and motives.""You have not been long in learning all his extraordinary qualities, my
lord," answered Major Bellenden."I, who have known him from boyhood,
could, before this affair, have said much of his good principles and
good-nature; but as to his high talents"--

"They were probably hidden, Major," replied the generous Lord Evandale,
"even from himself, until circumstances called them forth; and, if I have
detected them, it was only because our intercourse and conversation
turned on momentous and important subjects.He is now labouring to bring
this rebellion to an end, and the terms he has proposed are so moderate,
that they shall not want my hearty recommendation.""And have you hopes," said Lady Margaret, "to accomplish a scheme so
comprehensive?""I should have, madam, were every whig as moderate as Morton, and every
loyalist as disinterested as Major Bellenden.But such is the fanaticism
and violent irritation of both parties, that I fear nothing will end this
civil war save the edge of the sword."It may be readily supposed, that Edith listened with the deepest interest
to this conversation.While she regretted that she had expressed herself
harshly and hastily to her lover, she felt a conscious and proud
satisfaction that his character was, even in the judgment of his
noble-minded rival, such as her own affection had once spoke it."Civil feuds and domestic prejudices," she said, "may render it necessary
for me to tear his remembrance from my heart; but it is not small relief
to know assuredly, that it is worthy of the place it has so long retained
there."While Edith was thus retracting her unjust resentment, her lover arrived
at the camp of the insurgents, near Hamilton, which he found in
considerable confusion.Certain advices had arrived that the royal army,
having been recruited from England by a large detachment of the King's
Guards, were about to take the field.Fame magnified their numbers and
their high state of equipment and discipline, and spread abroad other
circumstances, which dismayed the courage of the insurgents.What favour
they might have expected from Monmouth, was likely to be intercepted by
the influence of those associated with him in command.His
lieutenant-general was the celebrated General Thomas Dalzell, who, having
practised the art of war in the then barbarous country of Russia, was as
much feared for his cruelty and indifference to human life and human
sufferings, as respected for his steady loyalty and undaunted valour.This man was second in command to Monmouth, and the horse were commanded
by Claverhouse, burning with desire to revenge the death of his nephew,
and his defeat at Drumclog.To these accounts was added the most
formidable and terrific description of the train of artillery and the
cavalry force with which the royal army took the field.[Note:  Royal Army at Bothwell Bridge.A Cameronian muse was
     awakened from slumber on this doleful occasion, and gave the
     following account of the muster of the royal forces, in poetry
     nearly as melancholy as the subject:--

                    They marched east through Lithgow-town
                    For to enlarge their forces;
                    And sent for all the north-country
                    To come, both foot and horses.Montrose did come and Athole both,
                    And with them many more;
                    And all the Highland Amorites
                    That had been there before.The Lowdien Mallisha--Lothian Militia they
                    Came with their coats of blew;
                    Five hundred men from London came,
                    Claid in a reddish hue.When they were assembled one and all,
                    A full brigade were they;
                    Like to a pack of hellish hounds,
                    Roreing after their prey.When they were all provided well,
                    In armour and amonition,
                    Then thither wester did they come,
                    Most cruel of intention.The royalists celebrated their victory in stanzas of equal merit.Specimens of both may be found in the curious collection of Fugitive
     Scottish Poetry, principally of the Seventeenth Century, printed for
     the Messrs Laing, Edinburgh.]Large bodies, composed of the Highland clans, having in language,
religion, and manners, no connexion with the insurgents, had been
summoned to join the royal army under their various chieftains; and these
Amorites, or Philistines, as the insurgents termed them, came like eagles
to the slaughter.In fact, every person who could ride or run at the
King's command, was summoned to arms, apparently with the purpose of
forfeiting and fining such men of property whom their principles might
deter from joining the royal standard, though prudence prevented them
from joining that of the insurgent Presbyterians.In short, everyrumour
tended to increase the apprehension among the insurgents, that the King's
vengeance had only been delayed in order that it might fall more certain
and more heavy.Morton endeavoured to fortify the minds of the common people by pointing
out the probable exaggeration of these reports, and by reminding them of
the strength of their own situation, with an unfordable river in front,
only passable by a long and narrow bridge.He called to their remembrance
their victory over Claverhouse when their numbers were few, and then much
worse disciplined and appointed for battle than now; showed them that the
ground on which they lay afforded, by its undulation, and the thickets
which intersected it, considerable protection against artillery, and even
against cavalry, if stoutly defended; and that their safety, in fact,
depended on their own spirit and resolution.But while Morton thus endeavoured to keep up the courage of the army at
large, he availed himself of those discouraging rumours to endeavour to
impress on the minds of the leaders the necessity of proposing to the
government moderate terms of accommodation, while they were still
formidable as commanding an unbroken and numerous army.He pointed out to
them, that, in the present humour of their followers, it could hardly be
expected that they would engage, with advantage, the well-appointed and
regular force of the Duke of Monmouth; and that if they chanced, as was
most likely, to be defeated and dispersed, the insurrection in which they
had engaged, so far from being useful to the country, would be rendered
the apology for oppressing it more severely.Pressed by these arguments, and feeling it equally dangerous to remain
together, or to dismiss their forces, most of the leaders readily agreed,
that if such terms could be obtained as had been transmitted to the Duke
of Monmouth by the hands of Lord Evandale, the purpose for which they had
taken up arms would be, in a great measure, accomplished.They then
entered into similar resolutions, and agreed to guarantee the petition
and remonstrance which had been drawn up by Morton.On the contrary,
there were still several leaders, and those men whose influence with the
people exceeded that of persons of more apparent consequence, who
regarded every proposal of treaty which did not proceed on the basis of
the Solemn League and Covenant of 1640, as utterly null and void,
impious, and unchristian.These men diffused their feelings among the
multitude, who had little foresight, and nothing to lose, and persuaded
many that the timid counsellors who recommended peace upon terms short of
the dethronement of the royal family, and the declared independence of
the church with respect to the state, were cowardly labourers, who were
about to withdraw their hands from the plough, and despicable trimmers,
who sought only a specious pretext for deserting their brethren in arms.These contradictory opinions were fiercely argued in each tent of the
insurgent army, or rather in the huts or cabins which served in the place
of tents.Violence in language often led to open quarrels and blows, and
the divisions into which the army of sufferers was rent served as too
plain a presage of their future fate.The curse of growing factions and divisions
               Still vex your councils!The prudence of Morton found sufficient occupation in stemming the
furious current of these contending parties, when, two days after his
return to Hamilton, he was visited by his friend and colleague, the
Reverend Mr Poundtext, flying, as he presently found, from the face of
John Balfour of Burley, whom he left not a little incensed at the share
he had taken in the liberation of Lord Evandale.When the worthy divine
had somewhat recruited his spirits, after the hurry and fatigue of his
journey, he proceeded to give Morton an account of what had passed in the
vicinity of Tillietudlem after the memorable morning of his departure.The night march of Morton had been accomplished with such dexterity,
and the men were so faithful to their trust, that Burley received no
intelligence of what had happened until the morning was far advanced.His first enquiry was, whether Macbriar and Kettledrummle had arrived,
agreeably to the summons which he had dispatched at midnight.Macbriar
had come, and Kettledrummle, though a heavy traveller, might, he was
informed, be instantly expected.Burley then dispatched a messenger to
Morton's quarters to summon him to an immediate council.The messenger
returned with news that he had left the place.Poundtext was next
summoned; but he thinking, as he said himself, that it was ill dealing
with fractious folk, had withdrawn to his own quiet manse, preferring a
dark ride, though he had been on horseback the whole preceding day, to a
renewal in the morning of a controversy with Burley, whose ferocity
overawed him when unsupported by the firmness of Morton.Burley's next
enquiries were directed after Lord Evandale; and great was his rage when
he learned that he had been conveyed away over night by a party of the
marksmen of Milnwood, under the immediate command of Henry Morton
himself.exclaimed Burley, addressing himself to Macbriar; "the
base, mean-spirited traitor, to curry favour for himself with the
government, hath set at liberty the prisoner taken by my own right hand,
through means of whom, I have little doubt, the possession of the place
of strength which hath wrought us such trouble, might now have been in
our hands!"said Macbriar, looking up towards the Keep
of the Castle; "and are not these the colours of the Covenant that float
over its walls?""A stratagem--a mere trick," said Burley, "an insult over our
disappointment, intended to aggravate and embitter our spirits."He was interrupted by the arrival of one of Morton's followers, sent to
report to him the evacuation of the place, and its occupation by the
insurgent forces.Burley was rather driven to fury than reconciled by the
news of this success."I have watched," he said--"I have fought--I have plotted--I have striven
for the reduction of this place--I have forborne to seek to head
enterprises of higher command and of higher honour--I have narrowed their
outgoings, and cut off the springs, and broken the staff of bread within
their walls; and when the men were about to yield themselves to my hand,
that their sons might be bondsmen, and their daughters a laughing-stock
to our whole camp, cometh this youth, without a beard on his chin, and
takes it on him to thrust his sickle into the harvest, and to rend the
prey from the spoiler!Surely the labourer is worthy of his hire, and the
city, with its captives, should be given to him that wins it?""Nay," said Macbriar, who was surprised at the degree of agitation which
Balfour displayed, "chafe not thyself because of the ungodly.Heaven will
use its own instruments; and who knows but this youth"--

"Hush!said Burley; "do not discredit thine own better judgment.It was thou that first badest me beware of this painted sepulchre--this
lacquered piece of copper, that passed current with me for gold.It fares
ill, even with the elect, when they neglect the guidance of such pious
pastors as thou.But our carnal affections will mislead us--this
ungrateful boy's father was mine ancient friend.They must be as earnest
in their struggles as thou, Ephraim Macbriar, that would shake themselves
clear of the clogs and chains of humanity."This compliment touched the preacher in the most sensible part; and
Burley deemed, therefore, he should find little difficulty in moulding
his opinions to the support of his own views, more especially as they
agreed exactly in their high-strained opinions of church government."Let us instantly," he said, "go up to the Tower; there is that among the
records in yonder fortress, which, well used as I can use it, shall be
worth to us a valiant leader and an hundred horsemen.""But will such be the fitting aids of the children of the Covenant?""We have already among us too many who hunger after lands,
and silver and gold, rather than after the Word; it is not by such that
our deliverance shall be wrought out.""Thou errest," said Burley; "we must work by means, and these worldly men
shall be our instruments.At all events, the Moabitish woman shall be
despoiled of her inheritance, and neither the malignant Evandale, nor the
erastian Morton, shall possess yonder castle and lands, though they may
seek in marriage the daughter thereof."So saying, he led the way to Tillietudlem, where he seized upon the plate
and other valuables for the use of the army, ransacked the charter-room,
and other receptacles for family papers, and treated with contempt the
remonstrances of those who reminded him, that the terms granted to the
garrison had guaranteed respect to private property.Burley and Macbriar, having established themselves in their new
acquisition, were joined by Kettledrummle in the course of the day, and
also by the Laird of Langcale, whom that active divine had contrived to
seduce, as Poundtext termed it, from the pure light in which he had been
brought up.Thus united, they sent to the said Poundtext an invitation,
or rather a summons, to attend a council at Tillietudlem.He remembered,
however, that the door had an iron grate, and the Keep a dungeon, and
resolved not to trust himself with his incensed colleagues.He therefore
retreated, or rather fled, to Hamilton, with the tidings, that Burley,
Macbriar, and Kettledrummle, were coming to Hamilton as soon as they
could collect a body of Cameronians sufficient to overawe the rest of the
army."And ye see," concluded Poundtext, with a deep sigh, "that they will then
possess a majority in the council; for Langcale, though he has always
passed for one of the honest and rational party, cannot be suitably or
preceesely termed either fish, or flesh, or gude red-herring--whoever has
the stronger party has Langcale."Thus concluded the heavy narrative of honest Poundtext, who sighed
deeply, as he considered the danger in which he was placed betwixt
unreasonable adversaries amongst themselves and the common enemy from
without.Morton exhorted him to patience, temper, and composure; informed
him of the good hope he had of negotiating for peace and indemnity
through means of Lord Evandale, and made out to him a very fair prospect
that he should again return to his own parchment-bound Calvin, his
evening pipe of tobacco, and his noggin of inspiring ale, providing
always he would afford his effectual support and concurrence to the
measures which he, Morton, had taken for a general pacification.The author does not, by any means,
     desire that Poundtext should be regarded as a just representation of
     the moderate presbyterians, among whom were many ministers whose
     courage was equal to their good sense and sound views of religion.Were he to write the tale anew, he would probably endeavour to give
     the character a higher turn.It is certain, however, that the
     Cameronians imputed to their opponents in opinion concerning the
     Indulgence, or others of their strained and fanatical notions, a
     disposition not only to seek their own safety, but to enjoy
     themselves.Hamilton speaks of three clergymen of this description
     as follows:--

     "They pretended great zeal against the Indulgence; but alas!that
     was all their practice, otherwise being but very gross, which I
     shall but hint at in short.When great Cameron and those with him
     were taking many a cold blast and storm in the fields and among the
     cot-houses in Scotland, these three had for the most part their
     residence in Glasgow, where they found good quarter and a full
     table, which I doubt not but some bestowed upon them from real
     affection to the Lord's cause; and when these three were together,
     their greatest work was who should make the finest and sharpest
     roundel, and breathe the quickest jests upon one another, and to
     tell what valiant acts they were to do, and who could laugh loudest
     and most heartily among them; and when at any time they came out to
     the country, whatever other things they had, they were careful each
     of them to have a great flask of brandy with them, which was very
     heavy to some, particularly to Mr Cameron, Mr Cargill, and Henry
     Hall--I shall name no more."Thus backed and comforted, Poundtext resolved magnanimously to await the
coming of the Cameronians to the general rendezvous.Burley and his confederates had drawn together a considerable body of
these sectaries, amounting to a hundred horse and about fifteen hundred
foot, clouded and severe in aspect, morose and jealous in communication,
haughty of heart, and confident, as men who believed that the pale of
salvation was open for them exclusively; while all other Christians,
however slight were the shades of difference of doctrine from their own,
were in fact little better than outcasts or reprobates.These men entered
the presbyterian camp, rather as dubious and suspicious allies, or
possibly antagonists, than as men who were heartily embarked in the same
cause, and exposed to the same dangers, with their more moderate brethren
in arms.Burley made no private visits to his colleagues, and held no
communication with them on the subject of the public affairs, otherwise
than by sending a dry invitation to them to attend a meeting of the
general council for that evening.On the arrival of Morton and Poundtext at the place of assembly, they
found their brethren already seated.Slight greeting passed between them,
and it was easy to see that no amicable conference was intended by those
who convoked the council.The first question was put by Macbriar, the
sharp eagerness of whose zeal urged him to the van on all occasions.He
desired to know by whose authority the malignant, called Lord Evandale,
had been freed from the doom of death, justly denounced against him."By my authority and Mr Morton's," replied Poundtext; who, besides being
anxious to give his companion a good opinion of his courage, confided
heartily in his support, and, moreover, had much less fear of
encountering one of his own profession, and who confined himself to the
weapons of theological controversy, in which Poundtext feared no man,
than of entering into debate with the stern homicide Balfour."And who, brother," said Kettledrummle, "who gave you authority to
interpose in such a high matter?""The tenor of our commission," answered Poundtext, "gives us authority to
bind and to loose.If Lord Evandale was justly doomed to die by the voice
of one of our number, he was of a surety lawfully redeemed from death by
the warrant of two of us.""Go to, go to," said Burley; "we know your motives; it was to send that
silkworm--that gilded trinket--that embroidered trifle of a lord, to bear
terms of peace to the tyrant.""It was so," replied Morton, who saw his companion begin to flinch before
the fierce eye of Balfour--"it was so; and what then?--Are we to plunge
the nation in endless war, in order to pursue schemes which are equally
wild, wicked, and unattainable?"said Balfour; "he blasphemeth.""It is false," said Morton; "they blaspheme who pretend to expect
miracles, and neglect the use of the human means with which Providence
has blessed them.I repeat it--Our avowed object is the re-establishment
of peace on fair and honourable terms of security to our religion and our
liberty.We disclaim any desire to tyrannize over those of others."The debate would now have run higher than ever, but they were interrupted
by intelligence that the Duke of Monmouth had commenced his march towards
the west, and was already advanced half way from Edinburgh.This news
silenced their divisions for the moment, and it was agreed that the next
day should be held as a fast of general humiliation for the sins of the
land; that the Reverend Mr Poundtext should preach to the army in the
morning, and Kettledrummle in the afternoon; that neither should touch
upon any topics of schism or of division, but animate the soldiers to
resist to the blood, like brethren in a good cause.This healing overture
having been agreed to, the moderate party ventured upon another proposal,
confiding that it would have the support of Langcale, who looked
extremely blank at the news which they had just received, and might be
supposed reconverted to moderate measures.It was to be presumed, they
said, that since the King had not intrusted the command of his forces
upon the present occasion to any of their active oppressors, but, on the
contrary, had employed a nobleman distinguished by gentleness of temper,
and a disposition favourable to their cause, there must be some better
intention entertained towards them than they had yet experienced.They
contended, that it was not only prudent but necessary to ascertain, from
a communication with the Duke of Monmouth, whether he was not charged
with some secret instructions in their favour.This could only be learned
by dispatching an envoy to his army.said Burley, evading a proposal too
reasonable to be openly resisted--"Who will go up to their camp, knowing
that John Grahame of Claverhouse hath sworn to hang up whomsoever we
shall dispatch towards them, in revenge of the death of the young man his
nephew?""Let that be no obstacle," said Morton; "I will with pleasure encounter
any risk attached to the bearer of your errand.""Let him go," said Balfour, apart to Macbriar; "our councils will be well
rid of his presence."The motion, therefore, received no contradiction even from those who were
expected to have been most active in opposing it; and it was agreed that
Henry Morton should go to the camp of the Duke of Monmouth, in order to
discover upon what terms the insurgents would be admitted to treat with
him.As soon as his errand was made known, several of the more moderate
party joined in requesting him to make terms upon the footing of the
petition intrusted to Lord Evandale's hands; for the approach of the
King's army spread a general trepidation, by no means allayed by the high
tone assumed by the Cameronians, which had so little to support it,
excepting their own headlong zeal.With these instructions, and with
Cuddie as his attendant, Morton set forth towards the royal camp, at all
the risks which attend those who assume the office of mediator during the
heat of civil discord.Morton had not proceeded six or seven miles, before he perceived that he
was on the point of falling in with the van of the royal forces; and, as
he ascended a height, saw all the roads in the neighbourhood occupied by
armed men marching in great order towards Bothwell-muir, an open common,
on which they proposed to encamp for that evening, at the distance of
scarcely two miles from the Clyde, on the farther side of which river the
army of the insurgents was encamped.He gave himself up to the first
advanced-guard of cavalry which he met, as bearer of a flag of truce, and
communicated his desire to obtain access to the Duke of Monmouth.The
non-commissioned officer who commanded the party made his report to his
superior, and he again to another in still higher command, and both
immediately rode to the spot where Morton was detained."You are but losing your time, my friend, and risking your life," said
one of them, addressing Morton; "the Duke of Monmouth will receive no
terms from traitors with arms in their hands, and your cruelties have
been such as to authorize retaliation of every kind.Better trot your nag
back and save his mettle to-day, that he may save your life to-morrow.""I cannot think," said Morton, "that even if the Duke of Monmouth should
consider us as criminals, he would condemn so large a body of his
fellow-subjects without even hearing what they have to plead for
themselves.I am conscious of having consented
to, or authorized, no cruelty, and the fear of suffering innocently for
the crimes of others shall not deter me from executing my commission.""I have an idea," said the younger, "that this is the young man of whom
Lord Evandale spoke.""Is my Lord Evandale in the army?""He is not," replied the officer; "we left him at Edinburgh, too much
indisposed to take the field.--Your name, sir, I presume, is Henry
Morton?""We will not oppose your seeing the Duke, sir," said the officer, with
more civility of manner; "but you may assure yourself it will be to no
purpose; for, were his Grace disposed to favour your people, others are
joined in commission with him who will hardly consent to his doing so.""I shall be sorry to find it thus," said Morton; "but my duty requires
that I should persevere in my desire to have an interview with him.""Lumley," said the superior officer, "let the Duke know of Mr Morton's
arrival, and remind his Grace that this is the person of whom Lord
Evandale spoke so highly."The officer returned with a message that the General could not see Mr
Morton that evening, but would receive him by times in the ensuing
morning.He was detained in a neighbouring cottage all night, but treated
with civility, and every thing provided for his accommodation.Early on
the next morning the officer he had first seen came to conduct him to his
audience.The army was drawn out, and in the act of forming column for march, or
attack.The Duke was in the centre, nearly a mile from the place where
Morton had passed the night.In riding towards the General, he had an
opportunity of estimating the force which had been assembled for the
suppression of the hasty and ill-concerted insurrection.There were three
or four regiments of English, the flower of Charles's army--there were
the Scottish Life-Guards, burning with desire to revenge their late
defeat--other Scottish regiments of regulars were also assembled, and a
large body of cavalry, consisting partly of gentlemen-volunteers, partly
of the tenants of the crown who did military duty for their fiefs.Morton
also observed several strong parties of Highlanders drawn from the points
nearest to the Lowland frontiers, a people, as already mentioned,
particularly obnoxious to the western whigs, and who hated and despised
them in the same proportion.These were assembled under their chiefs, and
made part of this formidable array.A complete train of field-artillery
accompanied these troops; and the whole had an air so imposing, that it
seemed nothing short of an actual miracle could prevent the ill-equipped,
ill-modelled, and tumultuary army of the insurgents from being utterly
destroyed.The officer who accompanied Morton endeavoured to gather from
his looks the feelings with which this splendid and awful parade of
military force had impressed him.But, true to the cause he had espoused,
he laboured successfully to prevent the anxiety which he felt from
appearing in his countenance, and looked around him on the warlike
display as on a sight which he expected, and to which he was indifferent."You see the entertainment prepared for you," said the officers."If I had no appetite for it," replied Morton, "I should not have been
accompanying you at this moment.But I shall be better pleased with a
more peaceful regale, for the sake of all parties."As they spoke thus, they approached the commander-in-chief, who,
surrounded by several officers, was seated upon a knoll commanding an
extensive prospect of the distant country, and from which could be easily
discovered the windings of the majestic Clyde, and the distant camp of
the insurgents on the opposite bank.The officers of the royal army
appeared to be surveying the ground, with the purpose of directing an
immediate attack.When Captain Lumley, the officer who accompanied
Morton, had whispered in Monmouth's ear his name and errand, the Duke
made a signal for all around him to retire, excepting only two general
officers of distinction.While they spoke together in whispers for a few
minutes before Morton was permitted to advance, he had time to study the
appearance of the persons with whom he was to treat.It was impossible for any one to look upon the Duke of Monmouth without
being captivated by his personal graces and accomplishments, of which the
great High-Priest of all the Nine afterwards recorded--

"Whate'er he did was done with so much ease, In him alone 'twas natural
to please; His motions all accompanied with grace, And Paradise was
open'd in his face."Yet to a strict observer, the manly beauty of
Monmouth's face was occasionally rendered less striking by an air of
vacillation and uncertainty, which seemed to imply hesitation and doubt
at moments when decisive resolution was most necessary.Beside him stood Claverhouse, whom we have already fully described, and
another general officer whose appearance was singularly striking.His
dress was of the antique fashion of Charles the First's time, and
composed of shamoy leather, curiously slashed, and covered with antique
lace and garniture.His boots and spurs might be referred to the same
distant period.He wore a breastplate, over which descended a grey beard
of venerable length, which he cherished as a mark of mourning for Charles
the First, having never shaved since that monarch was brought to the
scaffold.His head was uncovered, and almost perfectly bald.His high and
wrinkled forehead, piercing grey eyes, and marked features, evinced age
unbroken by infirmity, and stern resolution unsoftened by humanity.Such
is the outline, however feebly expressed, of the celebrated General
Thomas Dalzell,

     [Note:  Usually called Tom Dalzell.In Crichton's Memoirs, edited by
     Swift, where a particular account of this remarkable person's dress
     and habits is given, he is said never to have worn boots.The
     following account of his rencounter with John Paton of Meadowhead,
     showed, that in action at least he wore pretty stout ones, unless
     the reader be inclined to believe in the truth of his having a
     charm, which made him proof against lead."Dalzell," says Paton's biographer, "advanced the whole left wing of
     his army on Colonel Wallace's right.Here Captain Paton behaved with
     great courage and gallantry.Dalzell, knowing him in the former
     wars, advanced upon him himself, thinking to take him prisoner.Upon
     his approach, each presented his pistol.On their first discharge,
     Captain Paton, perceiving his pistol ball to hop upon Dalzell's
     boots, and knowing what was the cause, (he having proof,) put his
     hand in his pocket for some small pieces of silver he had there for
     the purpose, and put one of them into his other pistol.But Dalzell,
     having his eye upon him in the meanwhile, retired behind his own
     man, who by that means was slain."]a man more feared and hated by the whigs than even Claverhouse himself,
and who executed the same violences against them out of a detestation of
their persons, or perhaps an innate severity of temper, which Grahame
only resorted to on political accounts, as the best means of intimidating
the followers of presbytery, and of destroying that sect entirely.The presence of these two generals, one of whom he knew by person, and
the other by description, seemed to Morton decisive of the fate of his
embassy.But, notwithstanding his youth and inexperience, and the
unfavourable reception which his proposals seemed likely to meet with, he
advanced boldly towards them upon receiving a signal to that purpose,
determined that the cause of his country, and of those with whom he had
taken up arms, should suffer nothing from being intrusted to him.Monmouth received him with the graceful courtesy which attended even his
slightest actions; Dalzell regarded him with a stern, gloomy, and
impatient frown; and Claverhouse, with a sarcastic smile and inclination
of his head, seemed to claim him as an old acquaintance."You come, sir, from these unfortunate people, now assembled in arms,"
said the Duke of Monmouth, "and your name, I believe, is Morton; will you
favour us with the pupport of your errand?""It is contained, my lord," answered Morton, "in a paper, termed a
Remonstrance and Supplication, which my Lord Evandale has placed, I
presume, in your Grace's hands?""He has done so, sir," answered the Duke; "and I understand, from Lord
Evandale, that Mr Morton has behaved in these unhappy matters with much
temperance and generosity, for which I have to request his acceptance of
my thanks."Here Morton observed Dalzell shake his head indignantly, and whisper
something into Claverhouse's ear, who smiled in return, and elevated his
eyebrows, but in a degree so slight as scarce to be perceptible.The
Duke, taking the petition from his pocket, proceeded, obviously
struggling between the native gentleness of his own disposition, and
perhaps his conviction that the petitioners demanded no more than their
rights, and the desire, on the other hand, of enforcing the king's
authority, and complying with the sterner opinions of the colleagues in
office, who had been assigned for the purpose of controlling as well as
advising him."There are, Mr Morton, in this paper, proposals, as to the abstract
propriety of which I must now waive delivering any opinion.Some of them
appear to me reasonable and just; and, although I have no express
instructions from the King upon the subject, yet I assure you, Mr Morton,
and I pledge my honour, that I will interpose in your behalf, and use my
utmost influence to procure you satisfaction from his Majesty.But you
must distinctly understand, that I can only treat with supplicants, not
with rebels; and, as a preliminary to every act of favour on my side, I
must insist upon your followers laying down their arms and dispersing
themselves.""To do so, my Lord Duke," replied Morton, undauntedly, "were to
acknowledge ourselves the rebels that our enemies term us.Our swords are
drawn for recovery of a birthright wrested from us; your Grace's
moderation and good sense has admitted the general justice of our
demand,--a demand which would never have been listened to had it not been
accompanied with the sound of the trumpet.We cannot, therefore, and dare
not, lay down our arms, even on your Grace's assurance of indemnity,
unless it were accompanied with some reasonable prospect of the redress
of the wrongs which we complain of.""Mr Morton," replied the Duke, "you are young, but you must have seen
enough of the world to perceive, that requests, by no means dangerous or
unreasonable in themselves, may become so by the way in which they are
pressed and supported.""We may reply, my lord," answered Morton, "that this disagreeable mode
has not been resorted to until all others have failed.""Mr Morton," said the Duke, "I must break this conference short.We are
in readiness to commence the attack; yet I will suspend it for an hour,
until you can communicate my answer to the insurgents.If they please to
disperse their followers, lay down their arms, and send a peaceful
deputation to me, I will consider myself bound in honour to do all I can
to procure redress of their grievances; if not, let them stand on their
guard and expect the consequences.--I think, gentlemen," he added,
turning to his two colleagues, "this is the utmost length to which I can
stretch my instructions in favour of these misguided persons?""By my faith," answered Dalzell, suddenly, "and it is a length to which
my poor judgment durst not have stretched them, considering I had both
the King and my conscience to answer to!But, doubtless, your Grace knows
more of the King's private mind than we, who have only the letter of our
instructions to look to.""You hear," he said, addressing Morton, "General
Dalzell blames me for the length which I am disposed to go in your
favour.""General Dalzell's sentiments, my lord," replied Morton, "are such as we
expected from him; your Grace's such as we were prepared to hope you
might please to entertain.Indeed I cannot help adding, that, in the case
of the absolute submission upon which you are pleased to insist, it might
still remain something less than doubtful how far, with such counsellors
around the King, even your Grace's intercession might procure us
effectual relief.But I will communicate to our leaders your Grace's
answer to our supplication; and, since we cannot obtain peace, we must
bid war welcome as well as we may.""Good morning, sir," said the Duke; "I suspend the movements of attack
for one hour, and for one hour only.If you have an answer to return
within that space of time, I will receive it here, and earnestly entreat
it may be such as to save the effusion of blood."At this moment another smile of deep meaning passed between Dalzell and
Claverhouse.The Duke observed it, and repeated his words with great
dignity."Yes, gentlemen, I said I trusted the answer might be such as would save
the effusion of blood.I hope the sentiment neither needs your scorn, nor
incurs your displeasure."Dalzell returned the Duke's frown with a stern glance, but made no
answer.Claverhouse, his lip just curled with an ironical smile, bowed,
and said, "It was not for him to judge the propriety of his Grace's
sentiments."The Duke made a signal to Morton to withdraw.He obeyed; and, accompanied
by his former escort, rode slowly through the army to return to the camp
of the non-conformists.As he passed the fine corps of Life-Guards, he
found Claverhouse was already at their head.That officer no sooner saw
Morton, than he advanced and addressed him with perfect politeness of
manner."I think this is not the first time I have seen Mr Morton of Milnwood?""It is not Colonel Grahame's fault," said Morton, smiling sternly, "that
he or any one else should be now incommoded by my presence.""Allow me at least to say," replied Claverhouse, "that Mr Morton's
present situation authorizes the opinion I have entertained of him, and
that my proceedings at our last meeting only squared to my duty.""To reconcile your actions to your duty, and your duty to your
conscience, is your business, Colonel Grahame, not mine," said Morton,
justly offended at being thus, in a manner, required to approve of the
sentence under which he had so nearly suffered."Nay, but stay an instant," said Claverhouse; "Evandale insists that I
have some wrongs to acquit myself of in your instance.I trust I shall
always make some difference between a high-minded gentleman, who, though
misguided, acts upon generous principles, and the crazy fanatical clowns
yonder, with the bloodthirsty assassins who head them.Therefore, if they
do not disperse upon your return, let me pray you instantly come over to
our army and surrender yourself, for, be assured, they cannot stand our
assault for half an hour.If you will be ruled and do this, be sure to
enquire for me.Monmouth, strange as it may seem, cannot protect
you--Dalzell will not--I both can and will; and I have promised to
Evandale to do so if you will give me an opportunity.""I should owe Lord Evandale my thanks," answered Morton, coldly, "did not
his scheme imply an opinion that I might be prevailed on to desert those
with whom I am engaged.For you, Colonel Grahame, if you will honour me
with a different species of satisfaction, it is probable, that, in an
hour's time, you will find me at the west end of Bothwell Bridge with my
sword in my hand.""I shall be happy to meet you there," said Claverhouse, "but still more
so should you think better on my first proposal.""That is a pretty lad, Lumley," said Claverhouse, addressing himself to
the other officer; "but he is a lost man--his blood be upon his head."So saying, he addressed himself to the task of preparation for instant
battle.CHAPTER X.

               But, hark!the tent has changed its voice,
               There's peace and rest nae langer.The Lowdien Mallisha they
               Came with their coats of blew;
               Five hundred men from London came,
               Claid in a reddish hue.When Morton had left the well-ordered outposts of the regular army, and
arrived at those which were maintained by his own party, he could not but
be peculiarly sensible of the difference of discipline, and entertain a
proportional degree of fear for the consequences.The same discords which
agitated the counsels of the insurgents, raged even among their meanest
followers; and their picquets and patrols were more interested and
occupied in disputing the true occasion and causes of wrath, and defining
the limits of Erastian heresy, than in looking out for and observing the
motions of their enemies, though within hearing of the royal drums and
trumpets.There was a guard, however, of the insurgent army, posted at the long and
narrow bridge of Bothwell, over which the enemy must necessarily advance
to the attack; but, like the others, they were divided and disheartened;
and, entertaining the idea that they were posted on a desperate service,
they even meditated withdrawing themselves to the main body.This would
have been utter ruin; for, on the defence or loss of this pass the
fortune of the day was most likely to depend.All beyond the bridge was a
plain open field, excepting a few thickets of no great depth, and,
consequently, was ground on which the undisciplined forces of the
insurgents, deficient as they were in cavalry, and totally unprovided
with artillery, were altogether unlikely to withstand the shock of
regular troops.Morton, therefore, viewed the pass carefully, and formed the hope, that
by occupying two or three houses on the left bank of the river, with the
copse and thickets of alders and hazels that lined its side, and by
blockading the passage itself, and shutting the gates of a portal, which,
according to the old fashion, was built on the central arch of the bridge
of Bothwell, it might be easily defended against a very superior force.He issued directions accordingly, and commanded the parapets of the
bridge, on the farther side of the portal, to be thrown down, that they
might afford no protection to the enemy when they should attempt the
passage.Morton then conjured the party at this important post to be
watchful and upon their guard, and promised them a speedy and strong
reinforcement.He caused them to advance videttes beyond the river to
watch the progress of the enemy, which outposts he directed should be
withdrawn to the left bank as soon as they approached; finally, he
charged them to send regular information to the main body of all that
they should observe.Men under arms, and in a situation of danger, are
usually sufficiently alert in appreciating the merit of their officers.Morton's intelligence and activity gained the confidence of these men,
and with better hope and heart than before, they began to fortify their
position in the manner he recommended, and saw him depart with three loud
cheers.Morton now galloped hastily towards the main body of the insurgents, but
was surprised and shocked at the scene of confusion and clamour which it
exhibited, at the moment when good order and concord were of such
essential consequence.Instead of being drawn up in line of battle, and
listening to the commands of their officers, they were crowding together
in a confused mass, that rolled and agitated itself like the waves of the
sea, while a thousand tongues spoke, or rather vociferated, and not a
single ear was found to listen.Scandalized at a scene so extraordinary,
Morton endeavoured to make his way through the press to learn, and, if
possible, to remove, the cause of this so untimely disorder.While he is
thus engaged, we shall make the reader acquainted with that which he was
some time in discovering.The insurgents had proceeded to hold their day of humiliation, which,
agreeably to the practice of the puritans during the earlier civil war,
they considered as the most effectual mode of solving all difficulties,
and waiving all discussions.It was usual to name an ordinary week-day
for this purpose, but on this occasion the Sabbath itself was adopted,
owing to the pressure of the time and the vicinity of the enemy.A
temporary pulpit, or tent, was erected in the middle of the encampment;
which, according to the fixed arrangement, was first to be occupied by
the Reverend Peter Poundtext, to whom the post of honour was assigned, as
the eldest clergyman present.But as the worthy divine, with slow and
stately steps, was advancing towards the rostrum which had been prepared
for him, he was prevented by the unexpected apparition of Habakkuk
Mucklewrath, the insane preacher, whose appearance had so much startled
Morton at the first council of the insurgents after their victory at
Loudon-hill.It is not known whether he was acting under the influence
and instigation of the Cameronians, or whether he was merely compelled by
his own agitated imagination, and the temptation of a vacant pulpit
before him, to seize the opportunity of exhorting so respectable a
congregation.It is only certain that he took occasion by the forelock,
sprung into the pulpit, cast his eyes wildly round him, and, undismayed
by the murmurs of many of the audience, opened the Bible, read forth as
his text from the thirteenth chapter of Deuteronomy, "Certain men, the
children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the
inhabitants of their city, saying, let us go and serve other gods, which
you have not known;" and then rushed at once into the midst of his
subject.The harangue of Mucklewrath was as wild and extravagant as his intrusion
was unauthorized and untimely; but it was provokingly coherent, in so far
as it turned entirely upon the very subjects of discord, of which it had
been agreed to adjourn the consideration until some more suitable
opportunity.Not a single topic did he omit which had offence in it; and,
after charging the moderate party with heresy, with crouching to tyranny,
with seeking to be at peace with God's enemies, he applied to Morton, by
name, the charge that he had been one of those men of Belial, who, in the
words of his text, had gone out from amongst them, to withdraw the
inhabitants of his city, and to go astray after false gods.To him, and
all who followed him, or approved of his conduct, Mucklewrath denounced
fury and vengeance, and exhorted those who would hold themselves pure and
undefiled to come up from the midst of them."Fear not," he said, "because of the neighing of horses, or the
glittering of breastplates.Seek not aid of the Egyptians, because of the
enemy, though they may be numerous as locusts, and fierce as dragons.Their trust is not as our trust, nor their rock as our rock; how else
shall a thousand fly before one, and two put ten thousand to the flight!I dreamed it in the visions of the night, and the voice said, 'Habakkuk,
take thy fan and purge the wheat from the chaff, that they be not both
consumed with the fire of indignation and the lightning of fury.'Wherefore, I say, take this Henry Morton--this wretched Achan, who hath
brought the accursed thing among ye, and made himself brethren in the
camp of the enemy--take him and stone him with stones, and thereafter
burn him with fire, that the wrath may depart from the children of the
Covenant.He hath not taken a Babylonish garment, but he hath sold the
garment of righteousness to the woman of Babylon--he hath not taken two
hundred shekels of fine silver, but he hath bartered the truth, which is
more precious than shekels of silver or wedges of gold."At this furious charge, brought so unexpectedly against one of their most
active commanders, the audience broke out into open tumult, some
demanding that there should instantly be a new election of officers, into
which office none should hereafter be admitted who had, in their phrase,
touched of that which was accursed, or temporized more or less with the
heresies and corruptions of the times.While such was the demand of the
Cameronians, they vociferated loudly, that those who were not with them
were against them,--that it was no time to relinquish the substantial
part of the covenanted testimony of the Church, if they expected a
blessing on their arms and their cause; and that, in their eyes, a
lukewarm Presbyterian was little better than a Prelatist, an
Anti-Covenanter, and a Nullifidian.The parties accused repelled the charge of criminal compliance and
defection from the truth with scorn and indignation, and charged their
accusers with breach of faith, as well as with wrong-headed and
extravagant zeal in introducing such divisions into an army, the joint
strength of which could not, by the most sanguine, be judged more than
sufficient to face their enemies.Poundtext, and one or two others, made
some faint efforts to stem the increasing fury of the factious,
exclaiming to those of the other party, in the words of the
Patriarch,--"Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee,
and between thy herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we be brethren."No
pacific overture could possibly obtain audience.It was in vain that
even Burley himself, when he saw the dissension proceed to such ruinous
lengths, exerted his stern and deep voice, commanding silence and
obedience to discipline.The spirit of insubordination had gone forth,
and it seemed as if the exhortation of Habakkuk Mucklewrath had
communicated a part of his frenzy to all who heard him.The wiser, or
more timid part of the assembly, were already withdrawing themselves
from the field, and giving up their cause as lost.Others were
moderating a harmonious call, as they somewhat improperly termed it, to
new officers, and dismissing those formerly chosen, and that with a
tumult and clamour worthy of the deficiency of good sense and good order
implied in the whole transaction.It was at this moment when Morton
arrived in the field and joined the army, in total confusion, and on the
point of dissolving itself.His arrival occasioned loud exclamations of
applause on the one side, and of imprecation on the other."What means this ruinous disorder at such a moment?"he exclaimed to
Burley, who, exhausted with his vain exertions to restore order, was now
leaning on his sword, and regarding the confusion with an eye of resolute
despair."It means," he replied, "that God has delivered us into the hands of our
enemies.""Not so," answered Morton, with a voice and gesture which compelled many
to listen; "it is not God who deserts us, it is we who desert him, and
dishonour ourselves by disgracing and betraying the cause of freedom and
religion.--Hear me," he exclaimed, springing to the pulpit which
Mucklewrath had been compelled to evacuate by actual exhaustion--"I bring
from the enemy an offer to treat, if you incline to lay down your arms.I
can assure you the means of making an honourable defence, if you are of
more manly tempers.Let us resolve either for
peace or war; and let it not be said of us in future days, that six
thousand Scottish men in arms had neither courage to stand their ground
and fight it out, nor prudence to treat for peace, nor even the coward's
wisdom to retreat in good time and with safety.What signifies
quarrelling on minute points of church-discipline, when the whole edifice
is threatened with total destruction?O, remember, my brethren, that the
last and worst evil which God brought upon the people whom he had once
chosen--the last and worst punishment of their blindness and hardness of
heart, was the bloody dissensions which rent asunder their city, even
when the enemy were thundering at its gates!"Some of the audience testified their feeling of this exhortation, by loud
exclamations of applause; others by hooting, and exclaiming--"To your
tents, O Israel!"Morton, who beheld the columns of the enemy already beginning to appear
on the right bank, and directing their march upon the bridge, raised his
voice to its utmost pitch, and, pointing at the same time with his hand,
exclaimed,--"Silence your senseless clamours, yonder is the enemy!On
maintaining the bridge against him depend our lives, as well as our hope
to reclaim our laws and liberties.--There shall at least one Scottishman
die in their defence.--Let any one who loves his country follow me!"The multitude had turned their heads in the direction to which he
pointed.The sight of the glittering files of the English Foot-Guards,
supported by several squadrons of horse, of the cannon which the
artillerymen were busily engaged in planting against the bridge, of the
plaided clans who seemed to search for a ford, and of the long succession
of troops which were destined to support the attack, silenced at once
their clamorous uproar, and struck them with as much consternation as if
it were an unexpected apparition, and not the very thing which they ought
to have been looking out for.They gazed on each other, and on their
leaders, with looks resembling those that indicate the weakness of a
patient when exhausted by a fit of frenzy.Yet when Morton, springing
from the rostrum, directed his steps towards the bridge, he was followed
by about an hundred of the young men who were particularly attached to
his command.Burley turned to Macbriar--"Ephraim," he said, "it is Providence points
us the way, through the worldly wisdom of this latitudinarian youth.--He
that loves the light, let him follow Burley!""Tarry," replied Macbriar; "it is not by Henry Morton, or such as he,
that our goings-out and our comings-in are to be meted; therefore tarry
with us.I fear treachery to the host from this nullifidian Achan--Thou
shalt not go with him.Thou art our chariots and our horsemen.""Hinder me not," replied Burley; "he hath well said that all is lost, if
the enemy win the bridge--therefore let me not.Shall the children of
this generation be called wiser or braver than the children of the
sanctuary?--Array yourselves under your leaders--let us not lack supplies
of men and ammunition; and accursed be he who turneth back from the work
on this great day!"Having thus spoken, he hastily marched towards the bridge, and was
followed by about two hundred of the most gallant and zealous of his
party.There was a deep and disheartened pause when Morton and Burley
departed.The commanders availed themselves of it to display their lines
in some sort of order, and exhorted those who were most exposed to throw
themselves upon their faces to avoid the cannonade which they might
presently expect.The insurgents ceased to resist or to remonstrate; but
the awe which had silenced their discords had dismayed their courage.They suffered themselves to be formed into ranks with the docility of a
flock of sheep, but without possessing, for the time, more resolution or
energy; for they experienced a sinking of the heart, imposed by the
sudden and imminent approach of the danger which they had neglected to
provide against while it was yet distant.They were, however, drawn out
with some regularity; and as they still possessed the appearance of an
army, their leaders had only to hope that some favourable circumstance
would restore their spirits and courage.Kettledrummle, Poundtext, Macbriar, and other preachers, busied
themselves in their ranks, and prevailed on them to raise a psalm.But
the superstitious among them observed, as an ill omen, that their song of
praise and triumph sunk into "a quaver of consternation," and resembled
rather a penitentiary stave sung on the scaffold of a condemned criminal,
than the bold strain which had resounded along the wild heath of
Loudon-hill, in anticipation of that day's victory.The melancholy melody
soon received a rough accompaniment; the royal soldiers shouted, the
Highlanders yelled, the cannon began to fire on one side, and the
musketry on both, and the bridge of Bothwell, with the banks adjacent,
were involved in wreaths of smoke.As e'er ye saw the rain doun fa',
                    Or yet the arrow from the bow,
                    Sae our Scots lads fell even down,
                    And they lay slain on every knowe.Ere Morton or Burley had reached the post to be defended, the enemy had
commenced an attack upon it with great spirit.The two regiments of
Foot-Guards, formed into a close column, rushed forward to the river; one
corps, deploying along the right bank, commenced a galling fire on the
defenders of the pass, while the other pressed on to occupy the bridge.The insurgents sustained the attack with great constancy and courage; and
while part of their number returned the fire across the river, the rest
maintained a discharge of musketry upon the further end of the bridge
itself, and every avenue by which the soldiers endeavoured to approach
it.The latter suffered severely, but still gained ground, and the head
of their column was already upon the bridge, when the arrival of Morton
changed the scene; and his marksmen, commencing upon the pass a fire as
well aimed as it was sustained and regular, compelled the assailants to
retire with much loss.They were a second time brought up to the charge,
and a second time repulsed with still greater loss, as Burley had now
brought his party into action.The fire was continued with the utmost
vehemence on both sides, and the issue of the action seemed very dubious.Monmouth, mounted on a superb white charger, might be discovered on the
top of the right bank of the river, urging, entreating, and animating the
exertions of his soldiers.By his orders, the cannon, which had hitherto
been employed in annoying the distant main body of the presbyterians,
were now turned upon the defenders of the bridge.But these tremendous
engines, being wrought much more slowly than in modern times, did not
produce the effect of annoying or terrifying the enemy to the extent
proposed.The insurgents, sheltered by copsewood along the bank of the
river, or stationed in the houses already mentioned, fought under cover,
while the royalists, owing to the precautions of Morton, were entirely
exposed.The defence was so protracted and obstinate, that the royal
generals began to fear it might be ultimately successful.While Monmouth
threw himself from his horse, and, rallying the Foot-Guards, brought them
on to another close and desperate attack, he was warmly seconded
by Dalzell, who, putting himself at the head of a body of
Lennox-Highlanders, rushed forward with their tremendous war-cry of
Loch-sloy.[Note: This was the slogan or war-cry of the MacFarlanes, taken from
     a lake near the head of Loch Lomond, in the centre of their ancient
     possessions on the western banks of that beautiful inland sea.]The ammunition of the defenders of the bridge began to fail at this
important crisis; messages, commanding and imploring succours and
supplies, were in vain dispatched, one after the other, to the main body
of the presbyterian army, which remained inactively drawn up on the open
fields in the rear.Fear, consternation, and misrule, had gone abroad
among them, and while the post on which their safety depended required
to be instantly and powerfully reinforced, there remained none either to
command or to obey.As the fire of the defenders of the bridge began to slacken, that of the
assailants increased, and in its turn became more fatal.Animated by the
example and exhortations of their generals, they obtained a footing upon
the bridge itself, and began to remove the obstacles by which it was
blockaded.The portal-gate was broke open, the beams, trunks of trees,
and other materials of the barricade, pulled down and thrown into the
river.Morton and Burley
fought in the very front of their followers, and encouraged them with
their pikes, halberds, and partisans, to encounter the bayonets of the
Guards, and the broadswords of the Highlanders.But those behind the
leaders began to shrink from the unequal combat, and fly singly, or in
parties of two or three, towards the main body, until the remainder were,
by the mere weight of the hostile column as much as by their weapons,
fairly forced from the bridge.The passage being now open, the enemy
began to pour over.But the bridge was long and narrow, which rendered
the manoeuvre slow as well as dangerous; and those who first passed had
still to force the houses, from the windows of which the Covenanters
continued to fire.Burley and Morton were near each other at this
critical moment."There is yet time," said the former, "to bring down horse to attack
them, ere they can get into order; and, with the aid of God, we may thus
regain the bridge--hasten thou to bring them down, while I make the
defence good with this old and wearied body."Morton saw the importance of the advice, and, throwing himself on the
horse which cuddie held in readiness for him behind the thicket, galloped
towards a body of cavalry which chanced to be composed entirely of
Cameronians.Ere he could speak his errand, or utter his orders, he was
saluted by the execrations of the whole body.they exclaimed--"the cowardly traitor flies like a hart from
the hunters, and hath left valiant Burley in the midst of the slaughter!""I come to lead you to the attack.Advance
boldly, and we shall yet do well."--such were the tumultuous exclamations
which resounded from the ranks;--"he hath sold you to the sword of the
enemy!"And while Morton argued, entreated, and commanded in vain, the moment was
lost in which the advance might have been useful; and the outlet from the
bridge, with all its defences, being in complete possession of the enemy,
Burley and his remaining followers were driven back upon the main body,
to whom the spectacle of their hurried and harassed retreat was far from
restoring the confidence which they so much wanted.In the meanwhile, the forces of the King crossed the bridge at their
leisure, and, securing the pass, formed in line of battle; while
Claverhouse, who, like a hawk perched on a rock, and eyeing the time to
pounce on its prey, had watched the event of the action from the opposite
bank, now passed the bridge at the head of his cavalry, at full trot,
and, leading them in squadrons through the intervals and round the flanks
of the royal infantry, formed them in line on the moor, and led them to
the charge, advancing in front with one large body, while other two
divisions threatened the flanks of the Covenanters.Their devoted army
was now in that situation when the slightest demonstration towards an
attack was certain to inspire panic.Their broken spirits and
disheartened courage were unable to endure the charge of the cavalry,
attended with all its terrible accompaniments of sight and sound;--the
rush of the horses at full speed, the shaking of the earth under their
feet, the glancing of the swords, the waving of the plumes, and the
fierce shouts of the cavaliers.The front ranks hardly attempted one
ill-directed and disorderly fire, and their rear were broken and flying
in confusion ere the charge had been completed; and in less than five
minutes the horsemen were mixed with them, cutting and hewing without
mercy.The voice of Claverhouse was heard, even above the din of
conflict, exclaiming to his soldiers--"Kill, kill--no quarter--think on
Richard Grahame!"The dragoons, many of whom had shared the disgrace of
Loudon-hill, required no exhortations to vengeance as easy as it was
complete.Their swords drank deep of slaughter among the unresisting
fugitives.Screams for quarter were only answered by the shouts with
which the pursuers accompanied their blows, and the whole field presented
one general scene of confused slaughter, flight, and pursuit.About twelve hundred of the insurgents who remained in a body a little
apart from the rest, and out of the line of the charge of cavalry, threw
down their arms and surrendered at discretion, upon the approach of the
Duke of Monmouth at the head of the infantry.That mild-tempered nobleman
instantly allowed them the quarter which they prayed for; and, galloping
about through the field, exerted himself as much to stop the slaughter as
he had done to obtain the victory.While busied in this humane task he
met with General Dalzell, who was encouraging the fierce Highlanders and
royal volunteers to show their zeal for King and country, by quenching
the flame of the rebellion with the blood of the rebels."Sheathe your sword, I command you, General!"exclaimed the Duke, "and
sound the retreat.Enough of blood has been shed; give quarter to the
King's misguided subjects.""I obey your Grace," said the old man, wiping his bloody sword and
returning it to the scabbard; "but I warn you, at the same time, that
enough has not been done to intimidate these desperate rebels.Has not
your Grace heard that Basil Olifant has collected several gentlemen and
men of substance in the west, and is in the act of marching to join
them?"said the Duke; "who, or what is he?""The next male heir to the last Earl of Torwood.He is disaffected to
government from his claim to the estate being set aside in favour of Lady
Margaret Bellenden; and I suppose the hope of getting the inheritance has
set him in motion.""Be his motives what they will," replied Monmouth, "he must soon disperse
his followers, for this army is too much broken to rally again.Therefore, once more, I command that the pursuit be stopped.""It is your Grace's province to command, and to be responsible for your
commands," answered Dalzell, as he gave reluctant orders for checking the
pursuit.But the fiery and vindictive Grahame was already far out of hearing of
the signal of retreat, and continued with his cavalry an unwearied and
bloody pursuit, breaking, dispersing, and cutting to pieces all the
insurgents whom they could come up with.Burley and Morton were both hurried off the field by the confused tide of
fugitives.They made some attempt to defend the streets of the town of
Hamilton; but, while labouring to induce the fliers to face about and
stand to their weapons.Burley received a bullet which broke his
sword-arm."May the hand be withered that shot the shot!"he exclaimed, as the sword
which he was waving over his head fell powerless to his side.[Note: This incident, and Burley's exclamation, are
taken from the records.]Then turning his horse's head, he retreated out of the confusion.Morton
also now saw that the continuing his unavailing efforts to rally the
fliers could only end in his own death or captivity, and, followed by the
faithful Cuddie, he extricated himself from the press, and, being well
mounted, leaped his horse over one or two enclosures, and got into the
open country.From the first hill which they gained in their flight, they looked back,
and beheld the whole country covered with their fugitive companions, and
with the pursuing dragoons, whose wild shouts and halloo, as they did
execution on the groups whom they overtook, mingled with the groans and
screams of their victims, rose shrilly up the hill."It is impossible they can ever make head again," said Morton."The head's taen aff them, as clean as I wad bite it aff a sybo!"They'll be cunning that catches me at this wark
again.--But, for God's sake, sir, let us mak for some strength!"Morton saw the necessity of following the advice of his trusty squire.They resumed a rapid pace, and continued it without intermission,
directing their course towards the wild and mountainous country, where
they thought it likely some part of the fugitives might draw together,
for the sake either of making defence, or of obtaining terms.They require
               Of Heaven the hearts of lions, breath of tigers,
               Yea and the fierceness too.Evening had fallen; and, for the last two hours, they had seen none of
their ill-fated companions, when Morton and his faithful attendant gained
the moorland, and approached a large and solitary farmhouse, situated in
the entrance of a wild glen, far remote from any other habitation."Our horses," said Morton, "will carry us no farther without rest or
food, and we must try to obtain them here, if possible."So speaking, he led the way to the house.The place had every appearance
of being inhabited.There was smoke issuing from the chimney in a
considerable volume, and the marks of recent hoofs were visible around
the door.They could even hear the murmuring of human voices within the
house.But all the lower windows were closely secured; and when they
knocked at the door, no answer was returned.After vainly calling and
entreating admittance, they withdrew to the stable, or shed, in order to
accommodate their horses, ere they used farther means of gaining
admission.In this place they found ten or twelve horses, whose state of
fatigue, as well as the military yet disordered appearance of their
saddles and accoutrements, plainly indicated that their owners were
fugitive insurgents in their own circumstances."This meeting bodes luck," said Cuddie; "and they hae walth o' beef,
that's ae thing certain, for here's a raw hide that has been about the
hurdies o' a stot not half an hour syne--it's warm yet."Encouraged by these appearances, they returned again to the house, and,
announcing themselves as men in the same predicament with the inmates,
clamoured loudly for admittance."Whoever ye be," answered a stern voice from the window, after a long and
obdurate silence, "disturb not those who mourn for the desolation and
captivity of the land, and search out the causes of wrath and of
defection, that the stumbling-blocks may be removed over which we have
stumbled.""They are wild western whigs," said Cuddie, in a whisper to his master,
"I ken by their language.Fiend hae me, if I like to venture on them!"Morton, however, again called to the party within, and insisted on
admittance; but, finding his entreaties still disregarded, he opened one
of the lower windows, and pushing asunder the shutters, which were but
slightly secured, stepped into the large kitchen from which the voice had
issued.Cuddie followed him, muttering betwixt his teeth, as he put his
head within the window, "That he hoped there was nae scalding brose on
the fire;" and master and servant both found themselves in the company of
ten or twelve armed men, seated around the fire, on which refreshments
were preparing, and busied apparently in their devotions.In the gloomy countenances, illuminated by the fire-light, Morton had no
difficulty in recognising several of those zealots who had most
distinguished themselves by their intemperate opposition to all moderate
measures, together with their noted pastor, the fanatical Ephraim
Macbriar, and the maniac, Habakkuk Mucklewrath.The Cameronians neither
stirred tongue nor hand to welcome their brethren in misfortune, but
continued to listen to the low murmured exercise of Macbriar, as he
prayed that the Almighty would lift up his hand from his people, and not
make an end in the day of his anger.That they were conscious of the
presence of the intruders only appeared from the sullen and indignant
glances which they shot at them, from time to time, as their eyes
encountered.Morton, finding into what unfriendly society he had unwittingly intruded,
began to think of retreating; but, on turning his head, observed with
some alarm, that two strong men had silently placed themselves beside the
window, through which they had entered.One of these ominous sentinels
whispered to Cuddie, "Son of that precious woman, Mause Headrigg, do not
cast thy lot farther with this child of treachery and perdition--Pass on
thy way, and tarry not, for the avenger of blood is behind thee."With this he pointed to the window, out of which Cuddie jumped without
hesitation; for the intimation he had received plainly implied the
personal danger he would otherwise incur."Winnocks are no lucky wi' me," was his first reflection when he was in
the open air; his next was upon the probable fate of his master."They'll
kill him, the murdering loons, and think they're doing a gude turn!but
I'se tak the back road for Hamilton, and see if I canna get some o' our
ain folk to bring help in time of needcessity."So saying, Cuddie hastened to the stable, and taking the best horse he
could find instead of his own tired animal, he galloped off in the
direction he proposed.The noise of his horse's tread alarmed for an instant the devotion of the
fanatics.As it died in the distance, Macbriar brought his exercise to a
conclusion, and his audience raised themselves from the stooping posture,
and louring downward look, with which they had listened to it, and all
fixed their eyes sternly on Henry Morton."You bend strange countenances on me, gentlemen," said he, addressing
them."I am totally ignorant in what manner I can have deserved them."exclaimed Mucklewrath, starting up: "the
word that thou hast spurned shall become a rock to crush and to bruise
thee; the spear which thou wouldst have broken shall pierce thy side; we
have prayed, and wrestled, and petitioned for an offering to atone the
sins of the congregation, and lo!the very head of the offence is
delivered into our hand.He hath burst in like a thief through the
window; he is a ram caught in the thicket, whose blood shall be a
drink-offering to redeem vengeance from the church, and the place shall
from henceforth be called Jehovah-Jireh, for the sacrifice is provided.Up then, and bind the victim with cords to the horns of the altar!"There was a movement among the party; and deeply did Morton regret at
that moment the incautious haste with which he had ventured into their
company.He was armed only with his sword, for he had left his pistols at
the bow of his saddle; and, as the whigs were all provided with
fire-arms, there was little or no chance of escaping from them by
resistance.The interposition, however, of Macbriar protected him for the
moment."Tarry yet a while, brethren--let us not use the sword rashly, lest the
load of innocent blood lie heavy on us.--Come," he said, addressing
himself to Morton, "we will reckon with thee ere we avenge the cause thou
hast betrayed.--Hast thou not," he continued, "made thy face as hard as
flint against the truth in all the assemblies of the host?""He has--he has," murmured the deep voices of the assistants."He hath ever urged peace with the malignants," said one."And pleaded for the dark and dismal guilt of the Indulgence," said
another."And would have surrendered the host into the hands of Monmouth," echoed
a third; "and was the first to desert the honest and manly Burley, while
he yet resisted at the pass.I saw him on the moor, with his horse bloody
with spurring, long ere the firing had ceased at the bridge.""Gentlemen," said Morton, "if you mean to bear me down by clamour, and
take my life without hearing me, it is perhaps a thing in your power; but
you will sin before God and man by the commission of such a murder.""I say, hear the youth," said Macbriar; "for Heaven knows our bowels have
yearned for him, that he might be brought to see the truth, and exert his
gifts in its defence.But he is blinded by his carnal knowledge, and has
spurned the light when it blazed before him."Silence being obtained, Morton proceeded to assert the good faith which
he had displayed in the treaty with Monmouth, and the active part he had
borne in the subsequent action."I may not, gentlemen," he said, "be fully able to go the lengths you
desire, in assigning to those of my own religion the means of tyrannizing
over others; but none shall go farther in asserting our own lawful
freedom.And I must needs aver, that had others been of my mind in
counsel, or disposed to stand by my side in battle, we should this
evening, instead of being a defeated and discordant remnant, have
sheathed our weapons in an useful and honourable peace, or brandished
them triumphantly after a decisive victory.""He hath spoken the word," said one of the assembly--"he hath avowed his
carnal self-seeking and Erastianism; let him die the death!""Peace yet again," said Macbriar, "for I will try him further.--Was it
not by thy means that the malignant Evandale twice escaped from death and
captivity?Was it not through thee that Miles Bellenden and his garrison
of cut-throats were saved from the edge of the sword?""I am proud to say, that you have spoken the truth in both instances,"
replied Morton.you see," said Macbriar, "again hath his mouth spoken it.--And didst
thou not do this for the sake of a Midianitish woman, one of the spawn of
prelacy, a toy with which the arch-enemy's trap is baited?Didst thou not
do all this for the sake of Edith Bellenden?""You are incapable," answered Morton, boldly, "of appreciating my
feelings towards that young lady; but all that I have done I would have
done had she never existed.""Thou art a hardy rebel to the truth," said another dark-brow'd man; "and
didst thou not so act, that, by conveying away the aged woman, Margaret
Bellenden, and her grand-daughter, thou mightest thwart the wise and
godly project of John Balfour of Burley for bringing forth to battle
Basil Olifant, who had agreed to take the field if he were insured
possession of these women's worldly endowments?""I never heard of such a scheme," said Morton, "and therefore I could not
thwart it.--But does your religion permit you to take such uncreditable
and immoral modes of recruiting?""Peace," said Macbriar, somewhat disconcerted; "it is not for thee to
instruct tender professors, or to construe Covenant obligations.For the
rest, you have acknowledged enough of sin and sorrowful defection, to
draw down defeat on a host, were it as numerous as the sands on the
sea-shore.And it is our judgment, that we are not free to let you pass
from us safe and in life, since Providence hath given you into our hands
at the moment that we prayed with godly Joshua, saying, 'What shall we
say when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies?'--Then camest
thou, delivered to us as it were by lot, that thou mightest sustain the
punishment of one that hath wrought folly in Israel.This is the Sabbath, and our hand shall not be on thee to spill
thy blood upon this day; but, when the twelfth hour shall strike, it is a
token that thy time on earth hath run!Wherefore improve thy span, for it
flitteth fast away.--Seize on the prisoner, brethren, and take his
weapon."The command was so unexpectedly given, and so suddenly executed by those
of the party who had gradually closed behind and around Morton, that he
was overpowered, disarmed, and a horse-girth passed round his arms,
before he could offer any effectual resistance.When this was
accomplished, a dead and stern silence took place.The fanatics ranged
themselves around a large oaken table, placing Morton amongst them bound
and helpless, in such a manner as to be opposite to the clock which was
to strike his knell.Food was placed before them, of which they offered
their intended victim a share; but, it will readily be believed, he had
little appetite.When this was removed, the party resumed their
devotions.Macbriar, whose fierce zeal did not perhaps exclude some
feelings of doubt and compunction, began to expostulate in prayer, as if
to wring from the Deity a signal that the bloody sacrifice they proposed
was an acceptable service.The eyes and ears of his hearers were
anxiously strained, as if to gain some sight or sound which might be
converted or wrested into a type of approbation, and ever and anon dark
looks were turned on the dial-plate of the time-piece, to watch its
progress towards the moment of execution.Morton's eye frequently took the same course, with the sad reflection,
that there appeared no posibility of his life being expanded beyond the
narrow segment which the index had yet to travel on the circle until it
arrived at the fatal hour.Faith in his religion, with a constant
unyielding principle of honour, and the sense of conscious innocence,
enabled him to pass through this dreadful interval with less agitation
than he himself could have expected, had the situation been prophesied to
him.Yet there was a want of that eager and animating sense of right
which supported him in similar circumstances, when in the power of
Claverhouse.Then he was conscious, that, amid the spectators, were many
who were lamenting his condition, and some who applauded his conduct.But
now, among these pale-eyed and ferocious zealots, whose hardened brows
were soon to be bent, not merely with indifference, but with triumph,
upon his execution,--without a friend to speak a kindly word, or give a
look either of sympathy or encouragement,--awaiting till the sword
destined to slay him crept out of the scabbard gradually, and as it were
by strawbreadths, and condemned to drink the bitterness of death drop by
drop,--it is no wonder that his feelings were less composed than they had
been on any former occasion of danger.His destined executioners, as he
gazed around them, seemed to alter their forms and features, like
spectres in a feverish dream; their figures became larger, and their
faces more disturbed; and, as an excited imagination predominated over
the realities which his eyes received, he could have thought himself
surrounded rather by a band of demons than of human beings; the walls
seemed to drop with blood, and the light tick of the clock thrilled on
his ear with such loud, painful distinctness, as if each sound were the
prick of a bodkin inflicted on the naked nerve of the organ.[Illustration: Morton Awaiting Death--frontispiece2]


It was with pain that he felt his mind wavering, while on the brink
between this and the future world.He made a strong effort to compose
himself to devotional exercises, and unequal, during that fearful strife
of nature, to arrange his own thoughts into suitable expressions, he had,
instinctively, recourse to the petition for deliverance and for composure
of spirit which is to be found in the Book of Common Prayer of the Church
of England.Macbriar, whose family were of that persuasion, instantly
recognised the words, which the unfortunate prisoner pronounced half
aloud."There lacked but this," he said, his pale cheek kindling with
resentment, "to root out my carnal reluctance to see his blood spilt.He
is a prelatist, who has sought the camp under the disguise of an
Erastian, and all, and more than all, that has been said of him must
needs be verity.His blood be on his head, the deceiver!--let him go down
to Tophet, with the ill-mumbled mass which he calls a prayer-book, in his
right hand!""As the sun went
back on the dial ten degrees for intimating the recovery of holy
Hezekiah, so shall it now go forward, that the wicked may be taken away
from among the people, and the Covenant established in its purity."He sprang to a chair with an attitude of frenzy, in order to anticipate
the fatal moment by putting the index forward; and several of the party
began to make ready their slaughter-weapons for immediate execution, when
Mucklewrath's hand was arrested by one of his companions.he said--"I hear a distant noise.""It is the rushing of the brook over the pebbles," said one."It is the sough of the wind among the bracken," said another."It is the galloping of horse," said Morton to himself, his sense of
hearing rendered acute by the dreadful situation in which he stood; "God
grant they may come as my deliverers!"The noise approached rapidly, and became more and more distinct."It is horse," cried Macbriar."Look out and descry who they are."cried one who had opened the window, in
obedience to his order.A thick trampling and loud voices were heard immediately round the house.Some rose to resist, and some to escape; the doors and windows were
forced at once, and the red coats of the troopers appeared in the
apartment."Have at the bloody rebels!--Remember Cornet Grahame!"The lights were struck down, but the dubious glare of the fire enabled
them to continue the fray.Several pistol-shots were fired; the whig who
stood next to Morton received a shot as he was rising, stumbled against
the prisoner, whom he bore down with his weight, and lay stretched above
him a dying man.This accident probably saved Morton from the damage he
might otherwise have received in so close a struggle, where fire-arms
were discharged and sword-blows given for upwards of five minutes.exclaimed the well-known voice of Claverhouse;
"look about for him, and dispatch the whig dog who is groaning there."The groans of the wounded man were silenced by
a thrust with a rapier, and Morton, disencumbered of his weight, was
speedily raised and in the arms of the faithful Cuddie, who blubbered for
joy when he found that the blood with which his master was covered had
not flowed from his own veins.A whisper in Morton's ear, while his
trusty follower relieved him from his bonds, explained the secret of the
very timely appearance of the soldiers."I fell into Claverhouse's party when I was seeking for some o' our ain
folk to help ye out o' the hands of the whigs, sae being atween the deil
and the deep sea, I e'en thought it best to bring him on wi' me, for
he'll be wearied wi' felling folk the night, and the morn's a new day,
and Lord Evandale awes ye a day in ha'arst; and Monmouth gies quarter,
the dragoons tell me, for the asking.Sae haud up your heart, an' I'se
warrant we'll do a' weel eneugh yet."The principal incident of the foregoing
     Chapter was suggested by an occurrence of a similar kind, told me by
     a gentleman, now deceased, who held an important situation in the
     Excise, to which he had been raised by active and resolute exertions
     in an inferior department.When employed as a supervisor on the
     coast of Galloway, at a time when the immunities of the Isle of Man
     rendered smuggling almost universal in that district, this gentleman
     had the fortune to offend highly several of the leaders in the
     contraband trade, by his zeal in serving the revenue.This rendered his situation a dangerous one, and, on more than one
     occasion, placed his life in jeopardy.At one time in particular, as
     he was riding after sunset on a summer evening, he came suddenly
     upon a gang of the most desperate smugglers in that part of the
     country.They surrounded him, without violence, but in such a manner
     as to show that it would be resorted to if he offered resistance,
     and gave him to understand he must spend the evening with them,
     since they had met so happily.The officer did not attempt
     opposition, but only asked leave to send a country lad to tell his
     wife and family that he should be detained later than he expected.As he had to charge the boy with this message in the presence of the
     smugglers, he could found no hope of deliverance from it, save what
     might arise from the sharpness of the lad's observation, and the
     natural anxiety and affection of his wife.But if his errand should
     be delivered and received literally, as he was conscious the
     smugglers expected, it was likely that it might, by suspending alarm
     about his absence from home, postpone all search after him till it
     might be useless.Making a merit of necessity, therefore, he
     instructed and dispatched his messenger, and went with the
     contraband traders, with seeming willingness, to one of their
     ordinary haunts.He sat down at table with them, and they began to
     drink and indulge themselves in gross jokes, while, like Mirabel in
     the "Inconstant," their prisoner had the heavy task of receiving
     their insolence as wit, answering their insults with good-humour,
     and withholding from them the opportunity which they sought of
     engaging him in a quarrel, that they might have a pretence for
     misusing him.He succeeded for some time, but soon became satisfied
     it was their purpose to murder him out-right, or else to beat him in
     such a manner as scarce to leave him with life.A regard for the
     sanctity of the Sabbath evening, which still oddly subsisted among
     these ferocious men, amidst their habitual violation of divine and
     social law, prevented their commencing their intended cruelty until
     the Sabbath should be terminated.They were sitting around their
     anxious prisoner, muttering to each other words of terrible import,
     and watching the index of a clock, which was shortly to strike the
     hour at which, in their apprehension, murder would become lawful,
     when their intended victim heard a distant rustling like the wind
     among withered leaves.It came nearer, and resembled the sound of a
     brook in flood chafing within its banks; it came nearer yet, and was
     plainly distinguished as the galloping of a party of horse.The
     absence of her husband, and the account given by the boy of the
     suspicious appearance of those with whom he had remained, had
     induced Mrs--to apply to the neighbouring town for a party of
     dragoons, who thus providentially arrived in time to save him from
     extreme violence, if not from actual destruction.]Sound, sound the clarion, fill the fife!To all the sensual world proclaim,
               One crowded hour of glorious life
               Is worth an age without a name.When the desperate affray had ceased, Claverhouse commanded his soldiers
to remove the dead bodies, to refresh themselves and their horses, and
prepare for passing the night at the farm-house, and for marching early
in the ensuing morning.He then turned his attention to Morton, and there
was politeness, and even kindness, in the manner in which he addressed
him."You would have saved yourself risk from both sides, Mr Morton, if you
had honoured my counsel yesterday morning with some attention; but I
respect your motives.You are a prisoner-of-war at the disposal of the
king and council, but you shall be treated with no incivility; and I will
be satisfied with your parole that you will not attempt an escape."When Morton had passed his word to that effect, Claverhouse bowed
civilly, and, turning away from him, called for his sergeant-major."How many prisoners, Halliday, and how many killed?""Three killed in the house, sir, two cut down in the court, and one in
the garden--six in all; four prisoners.""Three of them armed to the teeth," answered Halliday; "one without
arms--he seems to be a preacher.""Ay--the trumpeter to the long-ear'd rout, I suppose," replied
Claverhouse, glancing slightly round upon his victims, "I will talk with
him tomorrow.Take the other three down to the yard, draw out two files,
and fire upon them; and, d'ye hear, make a memorandum in the orderly book
of three rebels taken in arms and shot, with the date and name of the
place--Drumshinnel, I think, they call it.--Look after the preacher till
to-morrow; as he was not armed, he must undergo a short examination.Or
better, perhaps, take him before the Privy Council; I think they should
relieve me of a share of this disgusting drudgery.--Let Mr Morton be
civilly used, and see that the men look well after their horses; and let
my groom wash Wild-blood's shoulder with some vinegar, the saddle has
touched him a little."All these various orders,--for life and death, the securing of his
prisoners, and the washing his charger's shoulder,--were given in the
same unmoved and equable voice, of which no accent or tone intimated that
the speaker considered one direction as of more importance than another.The Cameronians, so lately about to be the willing agents of a bloody
execution, were now themselves to undergo it.They seemed prepared alike
for either extremity, nor did any of them show the least sign of fear,
when ordered to leave the room for the purpose of meeting instant death.Their severe enthusiasm sustained them in that dreadful moment, and they
departed with a firm look and in silence, excepting that one of them, as
he left the apartment, looked Claverhouse full in the face, and
pronounced, with a stern and steady voice,--"Mischief shall haunt the
violent man!"to which Grahame only answered by a smile of contempt.They had no sooner left the room than Claverhouse applied himself to some
food, which one or two of his party had hastily provided, and invited
Morton to follow his example, observing, it had been a busy day for them
both.Morton declined eating; for the sudden change of circumstances--the
transition from the verge of the grave to a prospect of life, had
occasioned a dizzy revulsion in his whole system.But the same confused
sensation was accompanied by a burning thirst, and he expressed his wish
to drink."I will pledge you, with all my heart," said Claverhouse; "for here is a
black jack full of ale, and good it must be, if there be good in the
country, for the whigs never miss to find it out.--My service to you, Mr
Morton," he said, filling one horn of ale for himself, and handing
another to his prisoner.Morton raised it to his head, and was just about to drink, when the
discharge of carabines beneath the window, followed by a deep and hollow
groan, repeated twice or thrice, and more faint at each interval,
announced the fate of the three men who had just left them.Morton
shuddered, and set down the untasted cup."You are but young in these matters, Mr Morton," said Claverhouse, after
he had very composedly finished his draught; "and I do not think the
worse of you as a young soldier for appearing to feel them acutely.But
habit, duty, and necessity, reconcile men to every thing.""I trust," said Morton, "they will never reconcile me to such scenes as
these.""You would hardly believe," said Claverhouse in reply, "that, in the
beginning of my military career, I had as much aversion to seeing blood
spilt as ever man felt; it seemed to me to be wrung from my own heart;
and yet, if you trust one of those whig fellows, he will tell you I drink
a warm cup of it every morning before I breakfast.[Note: The author is
uncertain whether this was ever said of Claverhouse.But it was currently
reported of Sir Robert Grierson of Lagg, another of the persecutors, that
a cup of wine placed in his hand turned to clotted blood.]But in truth,
Mr Morton, why should we care so much for death, light upon us or around
us whenever it may?Men die daily--not a bell tolls the hour but it is
the death-note of some one or other; and why hesitate to shorten the span
of others, or take over-anxious care to prolong our own?It is all a
lottery--when the hour of midnight came, you were to die--it has struck,
you are alive and safe, and the lot has fallen on those fellows who were
to murder you.It is not the expiring pang that is worth thinking of in
an event that must happen one day, and may befall us on any given
moment--it is the memory which the soldier leaves behind him, like the
long train of light that follows the sunken sun--that is all which is
worth caring for, which distinguishes the death of the brave or the
ignoble.When I think of death, Mr Morton, as a thing worth thinking of,
it is in the hope of pressing one day some well-fought and hard-won
field of battle, and dying with the shout of victory in my ear--that
would be worth dying for, and more, it would be worth having lived for!"At the moment when Grahame delivered these sentiments, his eye glancing
with the martial enthusiasm which formed such a prominent feature in his
character, a gory figure, which seemed to rise out of the floor of the
apartment, stood upright before him, and presented the wild person and
hideous features of the maniac so often mentioned.His face, where it was
not covered with blood-streaks, was ghastly pale, for the hand of death
was on him.He bent upon Claverhouse eyes, in which the grey light of
insanity still twinkled, though just about to flit for ever, and
exclaimed, with his usual wildness of ejaculation, "Wilt thou trust in
thy bow and in thy spear, in thy steed and in thy banner?And shall not
God visit thee for innocent blood?--Wilt thou glory in thy wisdom, and in
thy courage, and in thy might?And shall not the Lord judge thee?--Behold
the princes, for whom thou hast sold thy soul to the destroyer, shall be
removed from their place, and banished to other lands, and their names
shall be a desolation, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a curse.And thou, who hast partaken of the wine-cup of fury, and hast been
drunken and mad because thereof, the wish of thy heart shall be granted
to thy loss, and the hope of thine own pride shall destroy thee.I summon
thee, John Grahame, to appear before the tribunal of God, to answer for
this innocent blood, and the seas besides which thou hast shed."He drew his right hand across his bleeding face, and held it up to heaven
as he uttered these words, which he spoke very loud, and then added more
faintly, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge
the blood of thy saints!"As he uttered the last word, he fell backwards without an attempt to save
himself, and was a dead man ere his head touched the floor.Morton was much shocked at this extraordinary scene, and the prophecy of
the dying man, which tallied so strangely with the wish which Claverhouse
had just expressed; and he often thought of it afterwards when that wish
seemed to be accomplished.Two of the dragoons who were in the apartment,
hardened as they were, and accustomed to such scenes, showed great
consternation at the sudden apparition, the event, and the words which
preceded it.At the first instant of
Mucklewrath's appearance, he had put his hand to his pistol, but on
seeing the situation of the wounded wretch, he immediately withdrew it,
and listened with great composure to his dying exclamation.When he dropped, Claverhouse asked, in an unconcerned tone of voice--"How
came the fellow here?--Speak, you staring fool!"he added, addressing the
nearest dragoon, "unless you would have me think you such a poltroon as
to fear a dying man."The dragoon crossed himself, and replied with a faltering voice,--"That
the dead fellow had escaped their notice when they removed the other
bodies, as he chanced to have fallen where a cloak or two had been flung
aside, and covered him.""Take him away now, then, you gaping idiot, and see that he does not bite
you, to put an old proverb to shame.--This is a new incident, Mr.Morton,
that dead men should rise and push us from our stools.I must see that my
blackguards grind their swords sharper; they used not to do their work so
slovenly.--But we have had a busy day; they are tired, and their blades
blunted with their bloody work; and I suppose you, Mr Morton, as well as
I, are well disposed for a few hours' repose."So saying, he yawned, and taking a candle which a soldier had placed
ready, saluted Morton courteously, and walked to the apartment which had
been prepared for him.Morton was also accommodated, for the evening, with a separate room.Being left alone, his first occupation was the returning thanks to Heaven
for redeeming him from danger, even through the instrumentality of those
who seemed his most dangerous enemies; he also prayed sincerely for the
Divine assistance in guiding his course through times which held out so
many dangers and so many errors.And having thus poured out his spirit in
prayer before the Great Being who gave it, he betook himself to the
repose which he so much required.The charge is prepared, the lawyers are met,
               The judges all ranged--a terrible show!So deep was the slumber which succeeded the agitation and embarrassment
of the preceding day, that Morton hardly knew where he was when it was
broken by the tramp of horses, the hoarse voice of men, and the wild
sound of the trumpets blowing the _reveille_.The sergeant-major
immediately afterwards came to summon him, which he did in a very
respectful manner, saying the General (for Claverhouse now held that
rank) hoped for the pleasure of his company upon the road.In some
situations an intimation is a command, and Morton considered that the
present occasion was one of these.He waited upon Claverhouse as speedily
as he could, found his own horse saddled for his use, and Cuddie in
attendance.Both were deprived of their fire-arms, though they seemed,
otherwise, rather to make part of the troop than of the prisoners; and
Morton was permitted to retain his sword, the wearing which was, in those
days, the distinguishing mark of a gentleman.Claverhouse seemed also to
take pleasure in riding beside him, in conversing with him, and in
confounding his ideas when he attempted to appreciate his real character.The gentleness and urbanity of that officer's general manners, the high
and chivalrous sentiments of military devotion which he occasionally
expressed, his deep and accurate insight into the human bosom, demanded
at once the approbation and the wonder of those who conversed with him;
while, on the other hand, his cold indifference to military violence and
cruelty seemed altogether inconsistent with the social, and even
admirable qualities which he displayed.Morton could not help, in his
heart, contrasting him with Balfour of Burley; and so deeply did the idea
impress him, that he dropped a hint of it as they rode together at some
distance from the troop."You are right," said Claverhouse, with a smile; "you are very right--we
are both fanatics; but there is some distinction between the fanaticism
of honour and that of dark and sullen superstition.""Yet you both shed blood without mercy or remorse," said Morton, who
could not suppress his feelings."Surely," said Claverhouse, with the same composure; "but of what
kind?--There is a difference, I trust, between the blood of learned and
reverend prelates and scholars, of gallant soldiers and noble gentlemen,
and the red puddle that stagnates in the veins of psalm-singing
mechanics, crackbrained demagogues, and sullen boors;--some distinction,
in short, between spilling a flask of generous wine, and dashing down a
can full of base muddy ale?""Your distinction is too nice for my comprehension," replied Morton."God
gives every spark of life--that of the peasant as well as of the prince;
and those who destroy his work recklessly or causelessly, must answer in
either case.What right, for example, have I to General Grahame's
protection now, more than when I first met him?""And narrowly escaped the consequences, you would say?"answered
Claverhouse--"why, I will answer you frankly.Then I thought I had to do
with the son of an old roundheaded rebel, and the nephew of a sordid
presbyterian laird; now I know your points better, and there is that
about you which I respect in an enemy as much as I like in a friend.I
have learned a good deal concerning you since our first meeting, and I
trust that you have found that my construction of the information has not
been unfavourable to you.""But yet," said Morton--

"But yet," interrupted Grahame, taking up the word, "you would say you
were the same when I first met you that you are now?True; but then, how
could I know that?though, by the by, even my reluctance to suspend your
execution may show you how high your abilities stood in my estimation.""Do you expect, General," said Morton, "that I ought to be particularly
grateful for such a mark of your esteem?""I tell you I thought
you a different sort of person."I have half a mind," said Claverhouse, "to contrive you should have six
months' imprisonment in order to procure you that pleasure.His chapters
inspire me with more enthusiasm than even poetry itself.And the noble
canon, with what true chivalrous feeling he confines his beautiful
expressions of sorrow to the death of the gallant and high-bred knight,
of whom it was a pity to see the fall, such was his loyalty to his king,
pure faith to his religion, hardihood towards his enemy, and fidelity to
his lady-love!--Ah, benedicite!how he will mourn over the fall of such a
pearl of knighthood, be it on the side he happens to favour, or on the
other.But, truly, for sweeping from the face of the earth some few
hundreds of villain churls, who are born but to plough it, the high-born
and inquisitive historian has marvellous little sympathy,--as little, or
less, perhaps, than John Grahame of Claverhouse.""There is one ploughman in your possession, General, for whom," said
Morton, "in despite of the contempt in which you hold a profession which
some philosophers have considered as useful as that of a soldier, I would
humbly request your favour.""You mean," said Claverhouse, looking at a memorandum book, "one
Hatherick--Hedderick--or--or--Headrigg.Ay, Cuthbert, or Cuddie
Headrigg--here I have him.O, never fear him, if he will be but
tractable.The ladies of Tillietudlem made interest with me on his
account some time ago.He is to marry their waiting-maid, I think.He
will be allowed to slip off easy, unless his obstinacy spoils his good
fortune.""He has no ambition to be a martyr, I believe," said Morton."'Tis the better for him," said Claverhouse."But, besides, although the
fellow had more to answer for, I should stand his friend, for the sake of
the blundering gallantry which threw him into the midst of our ranks last
night, when seeking assistance for you.I never desert any man who trusts
me with such implicit confidence.But, to deal sincerely with you, he has
been long in our eye.--Here, Halliday; bring me up the black book."The sergeant, having committed to his commander this ominous record of
the disaffected, which was arranged in alphabetical order, Claverhouse,
turning over the leaves as he rode on, began to read names as they
occurred."Gumblegumption, a minister, aged 50, indulged, close, sly, and so
forth--Pooh!pooh!--He--He--I have him here--Heathercat; outlawed--a
preacher--a zealous Cameronian--keeps a conventicle among the Campsie
hills--Tush!--O, here is Headrigg--Cuthbert; his mother a bitter
puritan--himself a simple fellow--like to be forward in action, but of
no genius for plots--more for the hand than the head, and might be drawn
to the right side, but for his attachment to"--(Here Claverhouse looked
at Morton, and then shut the book and changed his tone.)"Faithful and
true are words never thrown away upon me, Mr Morton.You may depend on
the young man's safety.""Does it not revolt a mind like yours," said Morton, "to follow a system
which is to be supported by such minute enquiries after obscure
individuals?""You do not suppose we take the trouble?""The curates, for their own sakes, willingly collect all these materials
for their own regulation in each parish; they know best the black sheep
of the flock."Will you favour me by imparting it?""Willingly," said Claverhouse; "it can signify little, for you cannot
avenge yourself on the curate, as you will probably leave Scotland for
some time."Morton felt an involuntary
shudder at hearing words which implied a banishment from his native land;
but ere he answered, Claverhouse proceeded to read, "Henry Morton, son of
Silas Morton, Colonel of horse for the Scottish Parliament, nephew and
apparent heir of Morton of Milnwood--imperfectly educated, but with
spirit beyond his years--excellent at all exercises--indifferent to forms
of religion, but seems to incline to the presbyterian--has high-flown and
dangerous notions about liberty of thought and speech, and hovers between
a latitudinarian and an enthusiast.Much admired and followed by the
youth of his own age--modest, quiet, and unassuming in manner, but in his
heart peculiarly bold and intractable.He is--Here follow three red
crosses, Mr Morton, which signify triply dangerous.You see how important
a person you are.--But what does this fellow want?"A horseman rode up as he spoke, and gave a letter.Claverhouse glanced it
over, laughed scornfully, bade him tell his master to send his prisoners
to Edinburgh, for there was no answer; and, as the man turned back, said
contemptuously to Morton--"Here is an ally of yours deserted from you, or
rather, I should say, an ally of your good friend Burley--Hear how he
sets forth--'Dear Sir,' (I wonder when we were such intimates,)'may it
please your Excellency to accept my humble congratulations on the
victory'--hum--hum--'blessed his Majesty's army.I pray you to understand
I have my people under arms to take and intercept all fugitives, and have
already several prisoners,' and so forth.Subscribed Basil Olifant--You
know the fellow by name, I suppose?""A relative of Lady Margaret Bellenden," replied Morton, "is he not?""Ay," replied Grahame, "and heir-male of her father's family, though a
distant one, and moreover a suitor to the fair Edith, though discarded as
an unworthy one; but, above all, a devoted admirer of the estate of
Tillietudlem, and all thereunto belonging.""He takes an ill mode of recommending himself," said Morton, suppressing
his feelings, "to the family at Tillietudlem, by corresponding with our
unhappy party.""O, this precious Basil will turn cat in pan with any man!""He was displeased with the government, because they would
not overturn in his favour a settlement of the late Earl of Torwood, by
which his lordship gave his own estate to his own daughter; he was
displeased with Lady Margaret, because she avowed no desire for his
alliance, and with the pretty Edith, because she did not like his tall
ungainly person.So he held a close correspondence with Burley, and
raised his followers with the purpose of helping him, providing always he
needed no help, that is, if you had beat us yesterday.And now the rascal
pretends he was all the while proposing the King's service, and, for
aught I know, the council will receive his pretext for current coin, for
he knows how to make friends among them--and a dozen scores of poor
vagabond fanatics will be shot, or hanged, while this cunning scoundrel
lies hid under the double cloak of loyalty, well-lined with the fox-fur
of hypocrisy."With conversation on this and other matters they beguiled the way,
Claverhouse all the while speaking with great frankness to Morton, and
treating him rather as a friend and companion than as a prisoner; so
that, however uncertain of his fate, the hours he passed in the company
of this remarkable man were so much lightened by the varied play of his
imagination, and the depth of his knowledge of human nature, that since
the period of his becoming a prisoner of war, which relieved him at once
from the cares of his doubtful and dangerous station among the
insurgents, and from the consequences of their suspicious resentment, his
hours flowed on less anxiously than at any time since his having
commenced actor in public life.He was now, with respect to his fortune,
like a rider who has flung his reins on the horse's neck, and, while he
abandoned himself to circumstances, was at least relieved from the task
of attempting to direct them.In this mood he journeyed on, the number of
his companions being continually augmented by detached parties of horse
who came in from every quarter of the country, bringing with them, for
the most part, the unfortunate persons who had fallen into their power."Our council," said Claverhouse, "being resolved, I suppose, to testify
by their present exultation the extent of their former terror, have
decreed a kind of triumphal entry to us victors and our captives; but as
I do not quite approve the taste of it, I am willing to avoid my own part
in the show, and, at the same time, to save you from yours."So saying, he gave up the command of the forces to Allan, (now a
Lieutenant-colonel,) and, turning his horse into a by-lane, rode into the
city privately, accompanied by Morton and two or three servants.When
Claverhouse arrived at the quarters which he usually occupied in the
Canongate, he assigned to his prisoner a small apartment, with an
intimation, that his parole confined him to it for the present.After about a quarter of an hour spent in solitary musing on the strange
vicissitudes of his late life, the attention of Morton was summoned to
the window by a great noise in the street beneath.Trumpets, drums, and
kettle-drums, contended in noise with the shouts of a numerous rabble,
and apprised him that the royal cavalry were passing in the triumphal
attitude which Claverhouse had mentioned.The magistrates of the city,
attended by their guard of halberds, had met the victors with their
welcome at the gate of the city, and now preceded them as a part of the
procession.The next object was two heads borne upon pikes; and before
each bloody head were carried the hands of the dismembered sufferers,
which were, by the brutal mockery of those who bore them, often
approached towards each other as if in the attitude of exhortation or
prayer.These bloody trophies belonged to two preachers who had fallen at
Bothwell Bridge.After them came a cart led by the executioner's
assistant, in which were placed Macbriar, and other two prisoners, who
seemed of the same profession.They were bareheaded, and strongly bound,
yet looked around them with an air rather of triumph than dismay, and
appeared in no respect moved either by the fate of their companions, of
which the bloody evidences were carried before them, or by dread of their
own approaching execution, which these preliminaries so plainly
indicated.Behind these prisoners, thus held up to public infamy and derision, came
a body of horse, brandishing their broadswords, and filling the wide
street with acclamations, which were answered by the tumultuous outcries
and shouts of the rabble, who, in every considerable town, are too happy
in being permitted to huzza for any thing whatever which calls them
together.In the rear of these troopers came the main body of the
prisoners, at the head of whom were some of their leaders, who were
treated with every circumstance of inventive mockery and insult.Several
were placed on horseback with their faces to the animal's tail; others
were chained to long bars of iron, which they were obliged to support in
their hands, like the galleyslaves in Spain when travelling to the port
where they are to be put on shipboard.The heads of others who had fallen
were borne in triumph before the survivors, some on pikes and halberds,
some in sacks, bearing the names of the slaughtered persons labelled on
the outside.Such were the objects who headed the ghastly procession, who
seemed as effectually doomed to death as if they wore the sanbenitos of
the condemned heretics in an auto-da-fe.[Note: David Hackston of
Rathillet, who was wounded and made prisoner in the skirmish of
Air's-Moss, in which the celebrated Cameron fell, was, on entering
Edinburgh, "by order of the Council, received by the Magistrates at the
Watergate, and set on a horse's bare back with his face to the tail, and
the other three laid on a goad of iron, and carried up the street, Mr
Cameron's head being on a halberd before them."]Behind them came on the nameless crowd to the number of several hundreds,
some retaining under their misfortunes a sense of confidence in the cause
for which they suffered captivity, and were about to give a still more
bloody testimony; others seemed pale, dispirited, dejected, questioning
in their own minds their prudence in espousing a cause which Providence
seemed to have disowned, and looking about for some avenue through which
they might escape from the consequences of their rashness.Others there
were who seemed incapable of forming an opinion on the subject, or of
entertaining either hope, confidence, or fear, but who, foaming with
thirst and fatigue, stumbled along like over-driven oxen, lost to every
thing but their present sense of wretchedness, and without having any
distinct idea whether they were led to the shambles or to the pasture.These unfortunate men were guarded on each hand by troopers, and behind
them came the main body of the cavalry, whose military music resounded
back from the high houses on each side of the street, and mingled with
their own songs of jubilee and triumph, and the wild shouts of the
rabble.Morton felt himself heart-sick while he gazed on the dismal spectacle,
and recognised in the bloody heads, and still more miserable and agonized
features of the living sufferers, faces which had been familiar to him
during the brief insurrection.He sunk down in a chair in a bewildered
and stupified state, from which he was awakened by the voice of Cuddie.said the poor fellow, his teeth chattering like a
pair of nut-crackers, his hair erect like boar's bristles, and his face
as pale as that of a corpse--"Lord forgie us, sir!we maun instantly gang
before the Council!--O Lord, what made them send for a puir bodie like
me, sae mony braw lords and gentles!--and there's my mither come on the
lang tramp frae Glasgow to see to gar me testify, as she ca's it, that is
to say, confess and be hanged; but deil tak me if they mak sic a guse o'
Cuddie, if I can do better.But here's Claverhouse himsell--the Lord
preserve and forgie us, I say anes mair!""You must immediately attend the Council Mr Morton," said Claverhouse,
who entered while Cuddie spoke, "and your servant must go with you.You
need be under no apprehension for the consequences to yourself
personally.But I warn you that you will see something that will give you
much pain, and from which I would willingly have saved you, if I had
possessed the power.It will be readily supposed that Morton did not venture to dispute this
invitation, however unpleasant."I must apprise you," said the latter, as he led the way down stairs,
"that you will get off cheap; and so will your servant, provided he can
keep his tongue quiet."Cuddie caught these last words to his exceeding joy."Deil a fear o' me," said he, "an my mither disna pit her finger in the
pie."At that moment his shoulder was seized by old Mause, who had contrived to
thrust herself forward into the lobby of the apartment."O, hinny, hinny!"said she to Cuddie, hanging upon his neck, "glad and
proud, and sorry and humbled am I, a'in ane and the same instant, to see
my bairn ganging to testify for the truth gloriously with his mouth in
council, as he did with his weapon in the field!""Whisht, whisht, mither!""Odd, ye daft wife,
is this a time to speak o' thae things?I tell ye I'll testify naething
either ae gate or another.I hae spoken to Mr Poundtext, and I'll tak the
declaration, or whate'er they ca'it, and we're a' to win free off if we
do that--he's gotten life for himsell and a' his folk, and that's a
minister for my siller; I like nane o' your sermons that end in a psalm
at the Grassmarket."[Note: Then the place of public execution.]"O, Cuddie, man, laith wad I be they suld hurt ye," said old Mause,
divided grievously between the safety of her son's soul and that of his
body; "but mind, my bonny bairn, ye hae battled for the faith, and dinna
let the dread o' losing creature-comforts withdraw ye frae the gude
fight.""Hout tout, mither," replied Cuddie, "I hae fought e'en ower muckle
already, and, to speak plain, I'm wearied o'the trade.I hae swaggered
wi' a' thae arms, and muskets, and pistols, buffcoats, and bandoliers,
lang eneugh, and I like the pleughpaidle a hantle better.I ken naething
suld gar a man fight, (that's to say, when he's no angry,) by and
out-taken the dread o'being hanged or killed if he turns back.""But, my dear Cuddie," continued the persevering Mause, "your bridal
garment--Oh, hinny, dinna sully the marriage garment!""Awa, awa, mither," replied.Cuddie; "dinna ye see the folks waiting for
me?--Never fear me--I ken how to turn this far better than ye do--for
ye're bleezing awa about marriage, and the job is how we are to win by
hanging."So saying, he extricated himself out of his mother's embraces, and
requested the soldiers who took him in charge to conduct him to the place
of examination without delay.He had been already preceded by Claverhouse
and Morton.The Privy Council of Scotland, in whom the practice since the union of
the crowns vested great judicial powers, as well as the general
superintendence of the executive department, was met in the ancient dark
Gothic room, adjoining to the House of Parliament in Edinburgh, when
General Grahame entered and took his place amongst the members at the
council table."You have brought us a leash of game to-day, General," said a nobleman of
high place amongst them."Here is a craven to confess--a cock of the game
to stand at bay--and what shall I call the third, General?""Without further metaphor, I will entreat your Grace to call him a person
in whom I am specially interested," replied Claverhouse.said the nobleman, lolling out a tongue
which was at all times too big for his mouth, and accommodating his
coarse features to a sneer, to which they seemed to be familiar."Yes, please your Grace, a whig; as your Grace was in 1641," replied
Claverhouse, with his usual appearance of imperturbable civility."He has you there, I think, my Lord Duke," said one of the Privy
Councillors."Ay, ay," returned the Duke, laughing, "there's no speaking to him since
Drumclog--but come, bring in the prisoners--and do you, Mr Clerk, read
the record."The clerk read forth a bond, in which General Grahame of Claverhouse and
Lord Evandale entered themselves securities, that Henry Morton, younger
of Milnwood, should go abroad and remain in foreign parts, until his
Majesty's pleasure was further known, in respect of the said Henry
Morton's accession to the late rebellion, and that under penalty of life
and limb to the said Henry Morton, and of ten thousand marks to each of
his securities."Do you accept of the King's mercy upon these terms, Mr Morton?"said the
Duke of Lauderdale, who presided in the Council."I have no other choice, my lord," replied Morton.Morton did so without reply, conscious that, in the circumstances of his
case, it was impossible for him to have escaped more easily.Macbriar,
who was at the same instant brought to the foot of the council-table,
bound upon a chair, for his weakness prevented him from standing, beheld
Morton in the act of what he accounted apostasy."He hath summed his defection by owning the carnal power of the tyrant!"he exclaimed, with a deep groan--"A fallen star!--a fallen star!""Hold your peace, sir," said the Duke, "and keep your ain breath to cool
your ain porridge--ye'll find them scalding hot, I promise you.--Call in
the other fellow, who has some common sense.One sheep will leap the
ditch when another goes first."Cuddie was introduced unbound, but under the guard of two halberdiers,
and placed beside Macbriar at the foot of the table.The poor fellow cast
a piteous look around him, in which were mingled awe for the great men in
whose presence he stood, and compassion for his fellow-sufferers, with no
small fear of the personal consequences which impended over himself.He
made his clownish obeisances with a double portion of reverence, and then
awaited the opening of the awful scene."Were you at the battle of Bothwell Brigg?"was the first question which
was thundered in his ears.Cuddie meditated a denial, but had sense enough, upon reflection, to
discover that the truth would be too strong for him; so he replied, with
true Caledonian indirectness of response, "I'll no say but it may be
possible that I might hae been there.""Answer directly, you knave--yes, or no?--You know you were there.""It's no for me to contradict your Lordship's Grace's honour," said
Cuddie."Once more, sir, were you there?--yes, or no?""Dear stir," again replied Cuddie, "how can ane mind preceesely where
they hae been a' the days o' their life?""Speak out, you scoundrel," said General Dalzell, "or I'll dash your
teeth out with my dudgeonhaft!--Do you think we can stand here all day to
be turning and dodging with you, like greyhounds after a hare?"[Note:
The General is said to have struck one of the captive whigs, when under
examination, with the hilt of his sabre, so that the blood gushed out.The provocation for this unmanly violence was, that the prisoner had
called the fierce veteran "a Muscovy beast, who used to roast men."Dalzell had been long in the Russian service, which in those days was no
school of humanity.]"Aweel, then," said Cuddie, "since naething else will please ye, write
down that I cannot deny but I was there.""Well, sir," said the Duke, "and do you think that the rising upon that
occasion was rebellion or not?""I'm no just free to gie my opinion, stir," said the cautious captive,
"on what might cost my neck; but I doubt it will be very little better.""Just than rebellion, as your honour ca's it," replied Cuddie."Well, sir, that's speaking to the purpose," replied his Grace."And are
you content to accept of the King's pardon for your guilt as a rebel, and
to keep the church, and pray for the King?""Blithely, stir," answered the unscrupulous Cuddie; "and drink his health
into the bargain, when the ale's gude.""Egad," said the Duke, "this is a hearty cock.--What brought you into
such a scrape, mine honest friend?""Just ill example, stir," replied the prisoner, "and a daft auld jaud of
a mither, wi' reverence to your Grace's honour.""Why, God-a-mercy, my friend," replied the Duke, "take care of bad advice
another time; I think you are not likely to commit treason on your own
score.--Make out his free pardon, and bring forward the rogue in the
chair."Macbriar was then moved forward to the post of examination."Were you at the battle of Bothwell Bridge?"was, in like manner,
demanded of him."I was," answered the prisoner, in a bold and resolute tone."I was not--I went in my calling as a preacher of God's word, to
encourage them that drew the sword in His cause.""In other words, to aid and abet the rebels?""Thou hast spoken it," replied the prisoner."Well, then," continued the interrogator, "let us know if you saw John
Balfour of Burley among the party?--I presume you know him?""I bless God that I do know him," replied Macbriar; "he is a zealous and
a sincere Christian.""And when and where did you last see this pious personage?""I am here to answer for myself," said Macbriar, in the same dauntless
manner, "and not to endanger others.""We shall know," said Dalzell, "how to make you find your tongue.""If you can make him fancy himself in a conventicle," answered
Lauderdale, "he will find it without you.--Come, laddie, speak while the
play is good--you're too young to bear the burden will be laid on you
else.""I defy you," retorted Macbriar."This has not been the first of my
imprisonments or of my sufferings; and, young as I may be, I have lived
long enough to know how to die when I am called upon.""Ay, but there are some things which must go before an easy death, if you
continue obstinate," said Lauderdale, and rung a small silver bell which
was placed before him on the table.A dark crimson curtain, which covered a sort of niche, or Gothic recess
in the wall, rose at the signal, and displayed the public executioner, a
tall, grim, and hideous man, having an oaken table before him, on which
lay thumb-screws, and an iron case, called the Scottish boot, used in
those tyrannical days to torture accused persons.Morton, who was
unprepared for this ghastly apparition, started when the curtain arose,
but Macbriar's nerves were more firm.He gazed upon the horrible
apparatus with much composure; and if a touch of nature called the blood
from his cheek for a second, resolution sent it back to his brow with
greater energy.said Lauderdale, in a low, stern voice,
almost sinking into a whisper."He is, I suppose," replied Macbriar, "the infamous executioner of your
bloodthirsty commands upon the persons of God's people.He and you are
equally beneath my regard; and, I bless God, I no more fear what he can
inflict than what you can command.Flesh and blood may shrink under the
sufferings you can doom me to, and poor frail nature may shed tears, or
send forth cries; but I trust my soul is anchored firmly on the rock of
ages.""Do your duty," said the Duke to the executioner.The fellow advanced, and asked, with a harsh and discordant voice, upon
which of the prisoner's limbs he should first employ his engine."Let him choose for himself," said the Duke; "I should like to oblige him
in any thing that is reasonable.""Since you leave it to me," said the prisoner, stretching forth his right
leg, "take the best--I willingly bestow it in the cause for which I
suffer."[Note: This was the reply actually made by James Mitchell when
subjected to the torture of the boot, for an attempt to assassinate
Archbishop Sharpe.]The executioner, with the help of his assistants, enclosed the leg and
knee within the tight iron boot, or case, and then placing a wedge of the
same metal between the knee and the edge of the machine, took a mallet in
his hand, and stood waiting for farther orders.A well-dressed man, by
profession a surgeon, placed himself by the other side of the prisoner's
chair, bared the prisoner's arm, and applied his thumb to the pulse in
order to regulate the torture according to the strength of the patient.When these preparations were made, the President of the Council repeated
with the same stern voice the question, "When and where did you last see
John Balfour of Burley?"The prisoner, instead of replying to him, turned his eyes to heaven as if
imploring Divine strength, and muttered a few words, of which the last
were distinctly audible, "Thou hast said thy people shall be willing in
the day of thy power!"The Duke of Lauderdale glanced his eye around the council as if to
collect their suffrages, and, judging from their mute signs, gave on his
own part a nod to the executioner, whose mallet instantly descended on
the wedge, and, forcing it between the knee and the iron boot, occasioned
the most exquisite pain, as was evident from the flush which instantly
took place on the brow and on the cheeks of the sufferer.The fellow then
again raised his weapon, and stood prepared to give a second blow."Will you yet say," repeated the Duke of Lauderdale, "where and when you
last parted from Balfour of Burley?""You have my answer," said the sufferer resolutely, and the second blow
fell.The third and fourth succeeded; but at the fifth, when a larger
wedge had been introduced, the prisoner set up a scream of agony.Morton, whose blood boiled within him at witnessing such cruelty, could
bear no longer, and, although unarmed and himself in great danger, was
springing forward, when Claverhouse, who observed his emotion, withheld
him by force, laying one hand on his arm and the other on his mouth,
while he whispered, "For God's sake, think where you are!"This movement, fortunately for him, was observed by no other of the
councillors, whose attention was engaged with the dreadful scene before
them."He is gone," said the surgeon--"he has fainted, my Lords, and human
nature can endure no more.""Release him," said the Duke; and added, turning to Dalzell, "He will
make an old proverb good, for he'll scarce ride to-day, though he has had
his boots on."Ay, dispatch his sentence, and have done with him; we have plenty of
drudgery behind."Strong waters and essences were busily employed to recall the senses of
the unfortunate captive; and, when his first faint gasps intimated a
return of sensation, the Duke pronounced sentence of death upon him, as a
traitor taken in the act of open rebellion, and adjudged him to be
carried from the bar to the common place of execution, and there hanged
by the neck; his head and hands to be stricken off after death, and
disposed of according to the pleasure of the Council, [Note: The pleasure
of the Council respecting the relics of their victims was often as savage
as the rest of their conduct.The heads of the preachers were frequently
exposed on pikes between their two hands, the palms displayed as in the
attitude of prayer.When the celebrated Richard Cameron's head was
exposed in this manner, a spectator bore testimony to it as that of one
who lived praying and preaching, and died praying and fighting.]and all
and sundry his movable goods and gear escheat and inbrought to his
Majesty's use."Doomster," he continued, "repeat the sentence to the prisoner."The office of Doomster was in those days, and till a much later period,
held by the executioner in commendam, with his ordinary functions.[Note:
See a note on the subject of this office in the Heart of Mid-Lothian.]The duty consisted in reciting to the unhappy criminal the sentence of
the law as pronounced by the judge, which acquired an additional and
horrid emphasis from the recollection, that the hateful personage by whom
it was uttered was to be the agent of the cruelties he denounced.Macbriar had scarce understood the purport of the words as first
pronounced by the Lord President of the Council; but he was sufficiently
recovered to listen and to reply to the sentence when uttered by the
harsh and odious voice of the ruffian who was to execute it, and at the
last awful words, "And this I pronounce for doom," he answered boldly--
"My Lords, I thank you for the only favour I looked for, or would accept
at your hands, namely, that you have sent the crushed and maimed carcass,
which has this day sustained your cruelty, to this hasty end.It were
indeed little to me whether I perish on the gallows or in the
prison-house; but if death, following close on what I have this day
suffered, had found me in my cell of darkness and bondage, many might
have lost the sight how a Christian man can suffer in the good cause.For
the rest, I forgive you, my Lords, for what you have appointed and I have
sustained--And why should I not?--Ye send me to a happy exchange--to the
company of angels and the spirits of the just, for that of frail dust
and ashes--Ye send me from darkness into day--from mortality to
immortality--and, in a word, from earth to heaven!--If the thanks,
therefore, and pardon of a dying man can do you good, take them at my
hand, and may your last moments be as happy as mine!"As he spoke thus, with a countenance radiant with joy and triumph, he was
withdrawn by those who had brought him into the apartment, and executed
within half an hour, dying with the same enthusiastic firmness which his
whole life had evinced.The Council broke up, and Morton found himself again in the carriage with
General Grahame."Marvellous firmness and gallantry!"said Morton, as he reflected upon
Macbriar's conduct; "what a pity it is that with such self-devotion and
heroism should have been mingled the fiercer features of his sect!""You mean," said Claverhouse, "his resolution to condemn you to death?--
To that he would have reconciled himself by a single text; for example,
'And Phinehas arose and executed judgment,' or something to the same
purpose.--But wot ye where you are now bound, Mr Morton?""We are on the road to Leith, I observe," answered Morton."Can I not be
permitted to see my friends ere I leave my native land?""Your uncle," replied Grahame, "has been spoken to, and declines visiting
you.The good gentleman is terrified, and not without some reason, that
the crime of your treason may extend itself over his lands and
tenements--he sends you, however, his blessing, and a small sum of money.Major Bellenden is at
Tillietudlem putting matters in order.The scoundrels have made great
havoc there with Lady Margaret's muniments of antiquity, and have
desecrated and destroyed what the good lady called the Throne of his most
Sacred Majesty.Is there any one else whom you would wish to see?"Morton sighed deeply as he answered, "No--it would avail nothing.--But my
preparations,--small as they are, some must be necessary.""They are all ready for you," said the General."Lord Evandale has
anticipated all you wish.Here is a packet from him with letters of
recommendation for the court of the Stadtholder Prince of Orange, to
which I have added one or two.I made my first campaigns under him, and
first saw fire at the battle of Seneff.Claverhouse
greatly distinguished himself in this action, and was made Captain.]There are also bills of exchange for your immediate wants, and more will
be sent when you require it."Morton heard all this and received the parcel with an astounded and
confused look, so sudden was the execution of the sentence of banishment."He shall be taken care of, and replaced, if it be practicable, in the
service of Lady Margaret Bellenden; I think he will hardly neglect the
parade of the feudal retainers, or go a-whigging a second time.--But here
we are upon the quay, and the boat waits you."A boat waited for Captain Morton, with
the trunks and baggage belonging to his rank.Claverhouse shook him by
the hand, and wished him good fortune, and a happy return to Scotland in
quieter times."I shall never forget," he said, "the gallantry of your behaviour to my
friend Evandale, in circumstances when many men would have sought to rid
him out of their way."As Morton descended the pier
to get into the boat, a hand placed in his a letter folded up in very
small space.The person who gave it seemed much muffled
up; he pressed his finger upon his lip, and then disappeared among the
crowd.The incident awakened Morton's curiosity; and when he found
himself on board of a vessel bound for Rotterdam, and saw all his
companions of the voyage busy making their own arrangements, he took an
opportunity to open the billet thus mysteriously thrust upon him.It ran
thus:--"Thy courage on the fatal day when Israel fled before his
enemies, hath, in some measure, atoned for thy unhappy owning of the
Erastian interest.These are not days for Ephraim to strive with Israel.--I know thy heart is with the daughter of the stranger.But turn from
that folly; for in exile, and in flight, and even in death itself, shall
my hand be heavy against that bloody and malignant house, and Providence
hath given me the means of meting unto them with their own measure of
ruin and confiscation.The resistance of their stronghold was the main
cause of our being scattered at Bothwell Bridge, and I have bound it upon
my soul to visit it upon them.Wherefore, think of her no more, but join
with our brethren in banishment, whose hearts are still towards this
miserable land to save and to relieve her.There is an honest remnant in
Holland whose eyes are looking out for deliverance.Join thyself unto
them like the true son of the stout and worthy Silas Morton, and thou
wilt have good acceptance among them for his sake and for thine own
working.Shouldst thou be found worthy again to labour in the vineyard,
thou wilt at all times hear of my in-comings and out-goings, by enquiring
after Quintin Mackell of Irongray, at the house of that singular
Christian woman, Bessie Maclure, near to the place called the Howff,
where Niel Blane entertaineth guests.So much from him who hopes to hear
again from thee in brotherhood, resisting unto blood, and striving
against sin.Keep thy sword
girded, and thy lamp burning, as one that wakes in the night; for He who
shall judge the Mount of Esau, and shall make false professors as straw,
and malignants as stubble, will come in the fourth watch with garments
dyed in blood, and the house of Jacob shall be for spoil, and the house
of Joseph for fire.I am he that hath written it, whose hand hath been on
the mighty in the waste field."This extraordinary letter was subscribed J. B. of B.; but the signature
of these initials was not necessary for pointing out to Morton that it
could come from no other than Burley.It gave him new occasion to admire
the indomitable spirit of this man, who, with art equal to his courage
and obstinacy, was even now endeavouring to re-establish the web of
conspiracy which had been so lately torn to pieces.But he felt no sort
of desire, in the present moment, to sustain a correspondence which must
be perilous, or to renew an association, which, in so many ways, had been
nearly fatal to him.The threats which Burley held out against the family
of Bellenden, he considered as a mere expression of his spleen on account
of their defence of Tillietudlem; and nothing seemed less likely than
that, at the very moment of their party being victorious, their fugitive
and distressed adversary could exercise the least influence over their
fortunes.Morton, however, hesitated for an instant, whether he should not send
the Major or Lord Evandale intimation of Burley's threats.Upon
consideration, he thought he could not do so without betraying his
confidential correspondence; for to warn them of his menaces would have
served little purpose, unless he had given them a clew to prevent them,
by apprehending his person; while, by doing so, he deemed he should
commit an ungenerous breach of trust to remedy an evil which seemed
almost imaginary.Upon mature consideration, therefore, he tore the
letter, having first made a memorandum of the name and place where the
writer was to be heard of, and threw the fragments into the sea.While Morton was thus employed the vessel was unmoored, and the white
sails swelled out before a favourable north-west wind.The ship leaned
her side to the gale, and went roaring through the waves, leaving a long
and rippling furrow to track her course.The city and port from which he
had sailed became undistinguishable in the distance; the hills by which
they were surrounded melted finally into the blue sky, and Morton was
separated for several years from the land of his nativity.It is fortunate for tale-tellers that they are not tied down like
theatrical writers to the unities of time and place, but may conduct
their personages to Athens and Thebes at their pleasure, and bring them
back at their convenience.Time, to use Rosalind's simile, has hitherto
paced with the hero of our tale; for betwixt Morton's first appearance as
a competitor for the popinjay and his final departure for Holland hardly
two months elapsed.Years, however, glided away ere we find it possible
to resume the thread of our narrative, and Time must be held to have
galloped over the interval.Craving, therefore, the privilege of my cast,
I entreat the reader's attention to the continuation of the narrative, as
it starts from a new era, being the year immediately subsequent to the
British Revolution.Scotland had just begun to repose from the convulsion occasioned by a
change of dynasty, and, through the prudent tolerance of King William,
had narrowly escaped the horrors of a protracted civil war.Agriculture
began to revive, and men, whose minds had been disturbed by the violent
political concussions, and the general change of government in Church and
State, had begun to recover their ordinary temper, and to give the usual
attention to their own private affairs, in lieu of discussing those of
the public.The Highlanders alone resisted the newly established order of
things, and were in arms in a considerable body under the Viscount of
Dundee, whom our readers have hitherto known by the name of Grahame of
Claverhouse.But the usual state of the Highlands was so unruly that
their being more or less disturbed was not supposed greatly to affect the
general tranquillity of the country, so long as their disorders were
confined within their own frontiers.In the Lowlands, the Jacobites, now
the undermost party, had ceased to expect any immediate advantage by open
resistance, and were, in their turn, driven to hold private meetings, and
form associations for mutual defence, which the government termed
treason, while they cried out persecution.The triumphant Whigs, while they re-established Presbytery as the
national religion, and assigned to the General Assemblies of the Kirk
their natural influence, were very far from going the lengths which the
Cameronians and more extravagant portion of the nonconformists under
Charles and James loudly demanded.They would listen to no proposal for
re-establishing the Solemn League and Covenant; and those who had
expected to find in King William a zealous Covenanted Monarch, were
grievously disappointed when he intimated, with the phlegm peculiar to
his country, his intention to tolerate all forms of religion which were
consistent with the safety of the State.The principles of indulgence
thus espoused and gloried in by the Government gave great offence to the
more violent party, who condemned them as diametrically contrary to
Scripture,--for which narrow-spirited doctrine they cited various texts,
all, as it may well be supposed, detached from their context, and most of
them derived from the charges given to the Jews in the Old Testament
dispensation to extirpate idolaters out of the Promised Land.They also
murmured highly against the influence assumed by secular persons in
exercising the rights of patronage, which they termed a rape upon the
chastity of the Church.They censured and condemned as Erastian many of
the measures by which Government after the Revolution showed an
inclination to interfere with the management of the Church, and they
positively refused to take the oath of allegiance to King William and
Queen Mary until they should, on their part, have sworn to the Solemn
League--and Covenant, the Magna Charta, as they termed it, of the
Presbyterian Church.This party, therefore, remained grumbling and dissatisfied, and made
repeated declarations against defections and causes of wrath, which, had
they been prosecuted as in the two former reigns, would have led to the
same consequence of open rebellion.But as the murmurers were allowed to
hold their meetings uninterrupted, and to testify as much as they pleased
against Socinianism, Erastianism, and all the compliances and defections
of the time, their zeal, unfanned by persecution, died gradually away,
their numbers became diminished, and they sunk into the scattered remnant
of serious, scrupulous, and harmless enthusiasts, of whom Old Mortality,
whose legends have afforded the groundwork of my tale, may be taken as no
bad representative.But in the years which immediately succeeded the
Revolution, the Cameronians continued a sect strong in numbers and
vehement in their political opinions, whom Government wished to
discourage, while they prudently temporised with them.These men formed
one violent party in the State; and the Episcopalian and Jacobite
interest, notwithstanding their ancient and national animosity, yet
repeatedly endeavoured to intrigue among them, and avail themselves of
their discontents, to obtain their assistance in recalling the Stewart
family.The Revolutionary Government in the mean while, was supported by
the great bulk of the Lowland interest, who were chiefly disposed to a
moderate Presbytery, and formed in a great measure the party who in the
former oppressive reigns were stigmatized by the Cameronians for having
exercised that form of worship under the declaration of Indulgence issued
by Charles II.Such was the state of parties in Scotland immediately
subsequent to the Revolution.It was on a delightful summer evening that a stranger, well mounted, and
having the appearance of a military man of rank, rode down a winding
descent which terminated in view of the romantic ruins of Bothwell Castle
and the river Clyde, which winds so beautifully between rocks and woods
to sweep around the towers formerly built by Aymer de Valence.Bothwell
Bridge was at a little distance, and also in sight.The opposite field,
once the scene of slaughter and conflict, now lay as placid and quiet as
the surface of a summer lake.The trees and bushes, which grew around in
romantic variety of shade, were hardly seen to stir under the influence
of the evening breeze.The very murmur of the river seemed to soften
itself into unison with the stillness of the scene around.The path through which the traveller descended was occasionally shaded by
detached trees of great size, and elsewhere by the hedges and boughs of
flourishing orchards, now laden with summer fruits.The nearest object of consequence was a farmhouse, or, it might be, the
abode of a small proprietor, situated on the side of a sunny bank which
was covered by apple and pear trees.At the foot of the path which led up
to this modest mansion was a small cottage, pretty much in the situation
of a porter's lodge, though obviously not designed for such a purpose.The hut seemed comfortable, and more neatly arranged than is usual in
Scotland.It had its little garden, where some fruit-trees and bushes
were mingled with kitchen herbs; a cow and six sheep fed in a paddock
hard by; the cock strutted and crowed, and summoned his family around him
before the door; a heap of brushwood and turf, neatly made up, indicated
that the winter fuel was provided; and the thin blue smoke which ascended
from the straw-bound chimney, and winded slowly out from among the green
trees, showed that the evening meal was in the act of being made ready.To complete the little scene of rural peace and comfort, a girl of about
five years old was fetching water in a pitcher from a beautiful fountain
of the purest transparency, which bubbled up at the root of a decayed old
oak-tree about twenty yards from the end of the cottage.The stranger reined up his horse and called to the little nymph, desiring
to know the way to Fairy Knowe.The child set down her water-pitcher,
hardly understanding what was said to her, put her fair flaxen hair apart
on her brows, and opened her round blue eyes with the wondering "What's
your wull?"which is usually a peasant's first answer, if it can be
called one, to all questions whatever."I wish to know the way to Fairy Knowe.""Mammie, mammie," exclaimed the little rustic, running towards the door
of the hut, "come out and speak to the gentleman."Her mother appeared,--a handsome young country-woman, to whose features,
originally sly and espiegle in expression, matrimony had given that
decent matronly air which peculiarly marks the peasant's wife of
Scotland.She had an infant in one arm, and with the other she smoothed
down her apron, to which hung a chubby child of two years old.The elder
girl, whom the traveller had first seen, fell back behind her mother as
soon as she appeared, and kept that station, occasionally peeping out to
look at the stranger.said the woman, with an air of respectful
breeding not quite common in her rank of life, but without anything
resembling forwardness.The stranger looked at her with great earnestness for a moment, and then
replied, "I am seeking a place called Fairy Knowe, and a man called
Cuthbert Headrigg."It's my gudeman, sir," said the young woman, with a smile of welcome."Will you alight, sir, and come into our puir dwelling?--Cuddie,
Cuddie,"--a white-headed rogue of four years appeared at the door of the
hut--"rin awa, my bonny man, and tell your father a gentleman wants him.Or, stay,--Jenny, ye'll hae mair sense: rin ye awa and tell him; he's
down at the Four-acres Park.--Winna ye light down and bide a blink, sir?Or would ye take a mouthfu' o' bread and cheese, or a drink o' ale, till
our gudeman comes.It's gude ale, though I shouldna say sae that brews
it; but ploughmanlads work hard, and maun hae something to keep their
hearts abune by ordinar, sae I aye pit a gude gowpin o' maut to the
browst."As the stranger declined her courteous offers, Cuddie, the reader's old
acquaintance, made his appearance in person.His countenance still
presented the same mixture of apparent dulness with occasional sparkles,
which indicated the craft so often found in the clouted shoe.He looked
on the rider as on one whom he never had before seen, and, like his
daughter and wife, opened the conversation with the regular query,
"What's your wull wi' me, sir?""I have a curiosity to ask some questions about this country," said the
traveller, "and I was directed to you as an intelligent man who can
answer them.""Nae doubt, sir," said Cuddie, after a moment's hesitation."But I would
first like to ken what sort of questions they are.I hae had sae mony
questions speered at me in my day, and in sic queer ways, that if ye kend
a', ye wadna wonder at my jalousing a' thing about them.My mother gar 'd
me learn the Single Carritch, whilk was a great vex; then I behoved to
learn about my godfathers and godmothers to please the auld leddy; and
whiles I jumbled them thegether and pleased nane o' them; and when I cam
to man's yestate, cam another kind o' questioning in fashion that I liked
waur than Effectual Calling; and the 'did promise and vow' of the tape
were yokit to the end o' the tother.Sae ye see, sir, I aye like to hear
questions asked befor I answer them.""You have nothing to apprehend from mine, my good friend; they only
relate to the state of the country."replied Cuddie; "ou, the country's weel eneugh, an it werena
that dour deevil, Claver'se (they ca' him Dundee now), that's stirring
about yet in the Highlands, they say, wi' a' the Donalds and Duncans and
Dugalds, that ever wore bottomless breeks, driving about wi' him, to set
things asteer again, now we hae gotten them a' reasonably weel settled.But Mackay will pit him down, there's little doubt o' that; he'll gie him
his fairing, I'll be caution for it.""What makes you so positive of that, my friend?""I heard it wi' my ain lugs," answered Cuddie, "foretauld to him by a man
that had been three hours stane dead, and came back to this earth again
just to tell him his mind.It was at a place they ca' Drumshinnel.""I can hardly believe you, my friend.""Ye might ask my mither, then, if she were in life," said Cuddie; "it was
her explained it a' to me, for I thought the man had only been wounded.At ony rate, he spake of the casting out of the Stewarts by their very
names, and the vengeance that was brewing for Claver'se and his dragoons.They ca'd the man Habakkuk Mucklewrath; his brain was a wee ajee, but he
was a braw preacher for a' that.""You seem," said the stranger, "to live in a rich and peaceful country.""It's no to compleen o', sir, an we get the crap weel in," quoth Cuddie;
"but if ye had seen the blude rinnin' as fast on the tap o' that brigg
yonder as ever the water ran below it, ye wadna hae thought it sae bonnie
a spectacle."I was waiting upon Monmouth that
morning, my good friend, and did see some part of the action," said the
stranger."Then ye saw a bonny stour," said Cuddie, "that sail serve me for
fighting a' the days o' my life.I judged ye wad be a trooper, by your
red scarlet lace-coat and your looped hat.""And which side were you upon, my friend?"continued the inquisitive
stranger.retorted Cuddie, with a knowing look, or what he designed for
such,--"there's nae use in telling that, unless I kend wha was asking
me.""I commend your prudence, but it is unnecessary; I know you acted on that
occasion as servant to Henry Morton."said Cuddie, in surprise, "how came ye by that secret?No that I
need care a bodee about it, for the sun's on our side o' the hedge now.I
wish my master were living to get a blink o't.""He was lost in the vessel gaun to that weary Holland,--clean lost; and
a' body perished, and my poor master amang them.Neither man nor mouse
was ever heard o' mair.""You had some regard for him, then?"His face was made of a fiddle, as they say, for a'
body that looked on him liked him.Oh, an ye
had but seen him down at the brigg there, fleeing about like a fleeing
dragon to gar folk fight that had unto little will till 't!There was he
and that sour Whigamore they ca'd Burley: if twa men could hae won a
field, we wadna hae gotten our skins paid that day.""You mention Burley: do you know if he yet lives?"Folk say he was abroad, and our sufferers wad
hold no communion wi' him, because o' his having murdered the archbishop.Sae he cam hame ten times dourer than ever, and broke aff wi' mony o' the
Presbyterians; and at this last coming of the Prince of Orange he could
get nae countenance nor command for fear of his deevilish temper, and he
hasna been heard of since; only some folk say that pride and anger hae
driven him clean wud.""And--and," said the traveller, after considerable hesitation,--"do you
know anything of Lord Evan dale?""<DW37> I ken onything o' Lord Evandale?Is not my young leddy up
by yonder at the house, that's as gude as married to him?""No, only what they ca' betrothed,--me and my wife were witnesses.It's
no mony months bypast; it was a lang courtship,--few folk kend the reason
by Jenny and mysell.I downa bide to see ye
sitting up there, and the clouds are casting up thick in the west ower
Glasgow-ward, and maist skeily folk think that bodes rain."In fact, a deep black cloud had already surmounted the setting sun; a few
large drops of rain fell, and the murmurs of distant thunder were heard."The deil's in this man," said Cuddie to himself; "I wish he would either
light aff or ride on, that he may quarter himsell in Hamilton or the
shower begin."But the rider sate motionless on his horse for two or three moments after
his last question, like one exhausted by some uncommon effort.At length,
recovering himself as if with a sudden and painful effort, he asked
Cuddie "if Lady Margaret Bellenden still lived.""She does," replied Cuddie, "but in a very sma' way.They hae been a sad
changed family since thae rough times began; they hae suffered eneugh
first and last,--and to lose the auld Tower and a' the bonny barony and
the holms that I hae pleughed sae often, and the Mains, and my kale-yard,
that I suld hae gotten back again, and a' for naething, as 'a body may
say, but just the want o' some bits of sheep-skin that were lost in the
confusion of the taking of Tillietudlem.""I have heard something of this," said the stranger, deepening his voice
and averting his head."I have some interest in the family, and would
willingly help them if I could.Can you give me a bed in your house
to-night, my friend?""It's but a corner of a place, sir," said Cuddie, "but we'se try, rather
than ye suld ride on in the rain and thunner; for, to be free wi' ye,
sir, I think ye seem no that ower weel.""I am liable to a dizziness," said the stranger, "but it will soon wear
off.""I ken we can gie ye a decent supper, sir," said Cuddie; "and we'll see
about a bed as weel as we can.We wad be laith a stranger suld lack what
we have, though we are jimply provided for in beds rather; for Jenny has
sae mony bairns (God bless them and her) that troth I maun speak to Lord
Evandale to gie us a bit eik, or outshot o' some sort, to the onstead.""I shall be easily accommodated," said the stranger, as he entered the
house."And ye may rely on your naig being weel sorted," said Cuddie; "I ken
weel what belangs to suppering a horse, and this is a very gude ane."Cuddie took the horse to the little cow-house, and called to his wife to
attend in the mean while to the stranger's accommodation.The officer
entered, and threw himself on a settle at some distance from the fire,
and carefully turning his back to the little lattice window.Headrigg, if the reader pleases, requested him to lay aside the
cloak, belt, and flapped hat which he wore upon his journey, but he
excused himself under pretence of feeling cold, and, to divert the time
till Cuddie's return, he entered into some chat with the children,
carefully avoiding, during the interval, the inquisitive glances of his
landlady.Our broken friendships we deplore,
                    And loves of youth that are no more.Cuddie soon returned, assuring the stranger, with a cheerful voice, "that
the horse was properly suppered up, and that the gudewife should make a
bed up for him at the house, mair purpose-like and comfortable than the
like o' them could gie him."said the stranger, with an interrupted and
broken voice."No, stir, they're awa wi' a' the servants,--they keep only twa nowadays,
and my gudewife there has the keys and the charge, though she's no a
fee'd servant.She has been born and bred in the family, and has a' trust
and management.If they were there, we behovedna to take sic freedom
without their order; but when they are awa, they will be weel pleased we
serve a stranger gentleman.Miss Bellenden wad help a' the haill warld,
an her power were as gude as her will; and her grandmother, Leddy
Margaret, has an unto respect for the gentry, and she's no ill to the
poor bodies neither.--And now, wife, what for are ye no getting forrit
wi' the sowens?""Never mind, lad," rejoined Jenny, "ye sall hae them in gude time; I ken
weel that ye like your brose het."Cuddie fidgeted and laughed with a peculiar expression of intelligence at
this repartee, which was followed by a dialogue of little consequence
betwixt his wife and him, in which the stranger took no share.At length
he suddenly interrupted them by the question: "Can you tell me when Lord
Evandale's marriage takes place?""Very soon, we expect," answered Jenny, before it was possible for her
husband to reply; "it wad hae been ower afore now, but for the death o'
auld Major Bellenden."said the stranger; "I heard at Edinburgh he was
no more."He couldna be said to haud up his head after his brother's wife and his
niece were turned out o' their ain house; and he had himsell sair
borrowing siller to stand the law,--but it was in the latter end o' King
James's days; and Basil Olifant, who claimed the estate, turned a <DW7>
to please the managers, and then naething was to be refused him.Sae the
law gaed again the leddies at last, after they had fought a weary sort o'
years about it; and, as I said before, the major ne'er held up his head
again.And then cam the pitting awa o' the Stewart line; and, though he
had but little reason to like them, he couldna brook that, and it clean
broke the heart o' him; and creditors cam to Charnwood and cleaned out a'
that was there,--he was never rich, the gude auld man, for he dow'd na
see onybody want.""He was indeed," said the stranger, with a faltering voice, "an admirable
man,--that is, I have heard that he was so.So the ladies were left
without fortune, as well as without a protector?""They will neither want the tane nor the tother while Lord Evandale
lives," said Jenny; "he has been a true friend in their griefs.E'en to
the house they live in is his lordship's; and never man, as my auld
gudemother used to say, since the days of the Patriarch Jacob, served sae
lang and sae sair for a wife as gude Lord Evandale has dune.""And why," said the stranger, with a voice that quivered with emotion,
"why was he not sooner rewarded by the object of his attachment?""There was the lawsuit to be ended," said Jenny readily, "forby many
other family arrangements.""Na, but," said Cuddie, "there was another reason forby; for the young
leddy--"

"Whisht, hand your tongue, and sup your sowens," said his wife; "I see
the gentleman's far frae weel, and downa eat our coarse supper.I wad
kill him a chicken in an instant.""There is no occasion," said the stranger; "I shall want only a glass of
water, and to be left alone.""You'll gie yoursell the trouble then to follow me," said Jenny, lighting
a small lantern, "and I'll show you the way."Cuddie also proffered his assistance; but his wife reminded him, "That
the bairns would be left to fight thegither, and coup ane anither into
the fire," so that he remained to take charge of the menage.His wife led the way up a little winding path, which, after threading
some thickets of sweetbrier and honeysuckle, conducted to the back-door
of a small garden.Jenny undid the latch, and they passed through an
old-fashioned flower-garden, with its clipped yew hedges and formal
parterres, to a glass-sashed door, which she opened with a master-key,
and lighting a candle, which she placed upon a small work-table, asked
pardon for leaving him there for a few minutes, until she prepared his
apartment.She did not exceed five minutes in these preparations; but
when she returned, was startled to find that the stranger had sunk
forward with his head upon the table, in what she at first apprehended to
be a swoon.As she advanced to him, however, she could discover by his
short-drawn sobs that it was a paroxysm of mental agony.She prudently
drew back until he raised his head, and then showing herself, without
seeming to have observed his agitation, informed him that his bed was
prepared.The stranger gazed at her a moment, as if to collect the sense
of her words.She repeated them; and only bending his head, as an
indication that he understood her, he entered the apartment, the door of
which she pointed out to him.It was a small bedchamber, used, as she
informed him, by Lord Evandale when a guest at Fairy Knowe, connecting,
on one side, with a little china-cabinet which opened to the garden, and
on the other, with a saloon, from which it was only separated by a thin
wainscot partition.Having wished the stranger better health and good
rest, Jenny descended as speedily as she could to her own mansion.she exclaimed to her helpmate as she entered, "I doubt
we're ruined folk!"returned the imperturbed
Cuddie, who was one of those persons who do not easily take alarm at
anything."Wha d' ye think yon gentleman is?Oh that ever ye suld hae asked him to
light here!""Why, wha the muckle deil d'ye say he is?There's nae law against
harbouring and intercommunicating now," said Cuddie; "sae, Whig or Tory,
what need we care wha he be?""Ay, but it's ane will ding Lord Evandale's marriage ajee yet, if it's
no the better looked to," said Jenny; "it's Miss Edith's first joe, your
ain auld maister, Cuddie."exclaimed Cuddie, starting up, "Crow ye that I am
blind?"Ay, but, Cuddie lad," replied Jenny, "though ye are no blind, ye are no
sae notice-taking as I am.""Weel, what for needs ye cast that up to me just now; or what did ye see
about the man that was like our Maister Harry?""I jaloused his keeping his face frae us,
and speaking wi' a madelike voice, sae I e'en tried him wi' some tales
o lang syne; and when I spake o' the brose, ye ken, he didna just
laugh,--he's ower grave for that nowadays, but he gae a gledge wi' his
ee that I kend he took up what I said.And a' his distress is about Miss
Edith's marriage; and I ne'er saw a man mair taen down wi' true love in
my days,--I might say man or woman, only I mind how ill Miss Edith was
when she first gat word that him and you (ye muckle graceless loon) were
coming against Tillietudlem wi' the rebels.--But what's the matter wi'
the man now?""What's the matter wi' me indeed!"said Cuddie, who was again hastily
putting on some of the garments he had stripped himself of; "am I no gaun
up this instant to see my maister?""Atweel, Cuddie, ye are gaun nae sic gate," said Jenny, coolly and
resolutely."D 'ye think I am to be John
Tamson's man, and maistered by women a' the days o' my life?""And whase man wad ye be?And wha wad ye hae to maister ye but me,
Cuddie, lad?""I'll gar ye comprehend in the making of a
hay-band.Naebody kens that this young gentleman is living but oursells;
and frae that he keeps himsell up sae close, I am judging that he's
purposing, if he fand Miss Edith either married, or just gaun to be
married, he wad just slide awa easy, and gie them nae mair trouble.But
if Miss Edith kend that he was living, and if she were standing before
the very minister wi' Lord Evandale when it was tauld to her, I'se
warrant she wad say No when she suld say Yes.""Weel," replied Cuddie, "and what's my business wi' that?If Miss Edith
likes her auld joe better than her new ane, what for suld she no be free
to change her mind like other folk?Ye ken, Jenny, Halliday aye threeps
he had a promise frae yoursell.""Halliday's a liar, and ye're naething but a gomeril to hearken till him,
Cuddie.And then for this leddy's choice, lack-a-day!ye may be sure a'
the gowd Mr.Morton has is on the outside o' his coat; and how can he
keep Leddy Margaret and the young leddy?""Nae doubt the auld laird left his
housekeeper the liferent, as he heard nought o' his nephew; but it's but
speaking the auld wife fair, and they may a' live brawly thegither, Leddy
Margaret and a'.""Rout tout, lad," replied Jenny; "ye ken them little to think leddies o'
their rank wad set up house wi' auld Ailie Wilson, when they're maist
ower proud to take favours frae Lord Evandale himsell.Na, na, they maun
follow the camp, if she tak Morton.""That wad sort ill wi' the auld leddy, to be sure," said Cuddie; "she wad
hardly win ower a lang day in the baggage-wain.""Then sic a flyting as there wad be between them, a' about Whig and
Tory," continued Jenny."To be sure," said Cuddie, "the auld leddy's unto kittle in thae
points.""And then, Cuddie," continued his helpmate, who had reserved her
strongest argument to the last, "if this marriage wi' Lord Evandale is
broken off, what comes o' our ain bit free house, and the kale-yard, and
the cow's grass?I trow that baith us and thae bonny bairns will be
turned on the wide warld!"Here Jenny began to whimper; Cuddie writhed himself this way and that
way, the very picture of indecision.At length he broke out, "Weel,
woman, canna ye tell us what we suld do, without a' this din about it?""Just do naething at a'," said Jenny."Never seem to ken onything about
this gentleman, and for your life say a word that he suld hae been here,
or up at the house!An I had kend, I wad hae gien him my ain bed, and
sleepit in the byre or he had gane up by; but it canna be helpit now.The
neist thing's to get him cannily awa the morn, and I judge he'll be in
nae hurry to come back again."said Cuddie; "and maun I no speak to him, then?""For your life, no," said Jenny."Ye're no obliged to ken him; and I
wadna hae tauld ye, only I feared ye wad ken him in the morning.""Aweel," said Cuddie, sighing heavily, "I'se awa to pleugh the outfield
then; for if I am no to speak to him, I wad rather be out o' the gate.""Very right, my dear hinny," replied Jenny."Naebody has better sense than
you when ye crack a bit wi' me ower your affairs; but ye suld ne'er do
onything aff hand out o' your ain head.""Ane wad think it's true," quoth Cuddie; "for I hae aye had some carline
or quean or another to gar me gang their gate instead o' my ain.There
was first my mither," he continued, as he undressed and tumbled himself
into bed; "then there was Leddy Margaret didna let me ca' my soul my ain;
then my mither and her quarrelled, and pu'ed me twa ways at anes, as if
ilk ane had an end o' me, like Punch and the Deevil rugging about the
Baker at the fair; and now I hae gotten a wife," he murmured in
continuation, as he stowed the blankets around his person, "and she's
like to tak the guiding o' me a' thegither.""And amna I the best guide ye ever had in a' your life?"said Jenny, as
she closed the conversation by assuming her place beside her husband and
extinguishing the candle.Leaving this couple to their repose, we have next to inform the reader
that, early on the next morning, two ladies on horseback, attended by
their servants, arrived at the house of Fairy Knowe, whom, to Jenny's
utter confusion, she instantly recognised as Miss Bellenden and Lady
Emily Hamilton, a sister of Lord Evandale."Had I no better gang to the house to put things to rights?"said Jenny,
confounded with this unexpected apparition."We want nothing but the pass-key," said Miss Bellenden; "Gudyill will
open the windows of the little parlour.""The little parlour's locked, and the lock's, spoiled," answered Jenny,
who recollected the local spmpathy between that apartment and the
bedchamber of her guest."In the red parlour, then," said Miss Bellenden, and rode up to the front
of the house, but by an approach different from that through which Morton
had been conducted."All will be out," thought Jenny, "unless I can get him smuggled out of
the house the back way."So saying, she sped up the bank in great tribulation and uncertainty."I had better hae said at ante there was a stranger there," was her next
natural reflection."But then they wad hae been for asking him to
breakfast.what will I do?--And there's Gudyill walking in
the garden too!"she exclaimed internally on approaching the wicket; "and
I daurna gang in the back way till he's aff the coast.In this state of perplexity she approached the cidevant butler, with the
purpose of decoying him out of the garden.But John Gudyill's temper was
not improved by his decline in rank and increase in years.Like many
peevish people, too, he seemed to have an intuitive perception as to what
was most likely to teaze those whom he conversed with; and, on the
present occasion, all Jenny's efforts to remove him from the garden
served only to root him in it as fast as if he had been one of the
shrubs.Unluckily, also, he had commenced florist during his residence at Fairy
Knowe; and, leaving all other things to the charge of Lady Emily's
servant, his first care was dedicated to the flowers, which he had taken
under his special protection, and which he propped, dug, and watered,
prosing all the while upon their respective merits to poor Jenny, who
stood by him trembling and almost crying with anxiety, fear, and
impatience.Fate seemed determined to win a match against Jenny this unfortunate
morning.As soon as the ladies entered the house, they observed that the
door of the little parlour--the very apartment out of which she was
desirous of excluding them on account of its contiguity to the room in
which Morton slept--was not only unlocked, but absolutely ajar.Miss
Bellenden was too much engaged with her own immediate subjects of
reflection to take much notice of the circumstance, but, desiring the
servant to open the window-shutters, walked into the room along with her
friend."He is not yet come," she said.Why
express so anxious a wish that we should meet him here?And why not come
to Castle Dinnan, as he proposed?I own, my dear Emily, that, even
engaged as we are to each other, and with the sanction of your presence,
I do not feel that I have done quite right in indulging him.""Evandale was never capricious," answered his sister; "I am sure he will
satisfy us with his reasons, and if he does not, I will help you to scold
him.""What I chiefly fear," said Edith, "is his having engaged in some of the
plots of this fluctuating and unhappy time.I know his heart is with that
dreadful Claverhouse and his army, and I believe he would have joined
them ere now but for my uncle's death, which gave him so much additional
trouble on our account.How singular that one so rational and so deeply
sensible of the errors of the exiled family should be ready to risk all
for their restoration!"answered Lady Emily,--"it is a point of honour with
Evandale.Our family have always been loyal; he served long in the
Guards; the Viscount of Dundee was his commander and his friend for
years; he is looked on with an evil eye by many of his own relations, who
set down his inactivity to the score of want of spirit.You must be
aware, my dear Edith, how often family connections and early
predilections influence our actions more than abstract arguments.But I
trust Evandale will continue quiet,--though, to tell you truth, I believe
you are the only one who can keep him so.""You can furnish him with the Scriptural apology for not going forth with
the host,--'he has married a wife, and therefore cannot come.'""I have promised," said Edith, in a faint voice; "but I trust I shall not
be urged on the score of time.""Nay," said Lady Emily, "I will leave Evandale (and here he comes) to
plead his own cause.""Stay, stay, for God's sake!"said Edith, endeavouring to detain her."Not I, not I," said the young lady, making her escape; "the third person
makes a silly figure on such occasions.When you want me for breakfast, I
will be found in the willow-walk by the river."As she tripped out of the room, Lord Evandale entered."Good-morrow,
Brother, and good-by till breakfast-time," said the lively young lady;
"I trust you will give Miss Bellenden some good reasons for disturbing
her rest so early in the morning."And so saying, she left them together, without waiting a reply."And now, my lord," said Edith, "may I desire to know the meaning of your
singular request to meet you here at so early an hour?"She was about to add that she hardly felt herself excusable in having
complied with it; but upon looking at the person whom she addressed, she
was struck dumb by the singular and agitated expression of his
countenance, and interrupted herself to exclaim, "For God's sake, what is
the matter?""His Majesty's faithful subjects have gained a great and most decisive
victory near Blair of Athole; but, alas!my gallant friend Lord Dundee--"

"Has fallen?"said Edith, anticipating the rest of his tidings."True, most true: he has fallen in the arms of victory, and not a man
remains of talents and influence sufficient to fill up his loss in King
James's service.This, Edith, is no time for temporizing with our duty.I
have given directions to raise my followers, and I must take leave of you
this evening.""Do not think of it, my lord," answered Edith; "your life is--essential
to your friends,--do not throw it away in an adventure so rash.What can
your single arm, and the few tenants or servants who might follow you, do
against the force of almost all Scotland, the Highland clans only
excepted?""Listen to me, Edith," said Lord Evandale."I am not so rash as you may
suppose me, nor are my present motives of such light importance as to
affect only those personally dependent on myself.The Life Guards, with
whom I served so long, although new-modelled and new-officered by the
Prince of Orange, retain a predilection for the cause of their rightful
master; and "--and here he whispered as if he feared even the walls of
the apartment had ears--"when my foot is known to be in the stirrup, two
regiments of cavalry have sworn to renounce the usurper's service, and
fight under my orders.They delayed only till Dundee should descend into
the Lowlands; but since he is no more, which of his successors dare take
that decisive step, unless encouraged by the troops declaring themselves!Meantime, the zeal of the soldiers will die away.I must bring them to a
decision while their hearts are glowing with the victory their old leader
has obtained, and burning to avenge his untimely death.""And will you, on the faith of such men as you know these soldiers to
be," said Edith, "take a part of such dreadful moment?""I will," said Lord Evandale,--"I must; my honour and loyalty are both
pledged for it.""And all for the sake," continued Miss Bellenden, "of a prince whose
measures, while he was on the throne, no one could condemn more than Lord
Evandale?""Most true," replied Lord Evandale; "and as I resented, even during the
plenitude of his power, his innovations on Church and State, like a
freeborn subject, I am determined I will assert his real rights, when he
is in adversity, like a loyal one.Let courtiers and sycophants flatter
power and desert misfortune; I will neither do the one nor the other.""And if you are determined to act what my feeble judgment must still term
rashly, why give yourself the pain of this untimely meeting?""Were it not enough to answer," said Lord Evandale, "that, ere rushing on
battle, I wished to bid adieu to my betrothed bride?Surely it is judging
coldly of my feelings, and showing too plainly the indifference of your
own, to question my motive for a request so natural.""But why in this place, my lord," said Edith; "and why with such peculiar
circumstances of mystery?""Because," he replied, putting a letter into her hand, "I have yet
another request, which I dare hardly proffer, even when prefaced by these
credentials."In haste and terror, Edith glanced over the letter, which was from her
grandmother."My dearest childe," such was its tenor in style and spelling, "I
     never more deeply regretted the reumatizm, which disqualified me
     from riding on horseback, than at this present writing, when I would
     most have wished to be where this paper will soon be, that is at
     Fairy Knowe, with my poor dear Willie's only child.But it is the
     will of God I should not be with her, which I conclude to be the
     case, as much for the pain I now suffer, as because it hath now not
     given way either to cammomile poultices or to decoxion of wild
     mustard, wherewith I have often relieved others.Therefore, I must
     tell you, by writing instead of word of mouth, that, as my young
     Lord Evandale is called to the present campaign, both by his honour
     and his duty, he hath earnestly solicited me that the bonds of holy
     matrimony be knitted before his departure to the wars between you
     and him, in implement of the indenture formerly entered into for
     that effeck, whereuntill, as I see no raisonable objexion, so I
     trust that you, who have been always a good and obedient childe,
     will not devize any which has less than raison.It is trew that the
     contrax of our house have heretofore been celebrated in a manner
     more befitting our Rank, and not in private, and with few witnesses,
     as a thing done in a corner.But it has been Heaven's own free will,
     as well as those of the kingdom where we live, to take away from us
     our estate, and from the King his throne.Yet I trust He will yet
     restore the rightful heir to the throne, and turn his heart to the
     true Protestant Episcopal faith, which I have the better right to
     expect to see even with my old eyes, as I have beheld the royal
     family when they were struggling as sorely with masterful usurpers
     and rebels as they are now; that is to say, when his most sacred
     Majesty, Charles the Second of happy memory, honoured our poor house
     of Tillietudlem by taking his _disjune_ therein," etc., etc., etc.We will not abuse the reader's patience by quoting more of Lady
Margaret's prolix epistle.Suffice it to say that it closed by laying her
commands on her grandchild to consent to the solemnization of her
marriage without loss of time."I never thought till this instant," said Edith, dropping the letter from
her hand, "that Lord Evandale would have acted ungenerously.""And how can you apply such a
term to my desire to call you mine, ere I part from you, perhaps for
ever?""Lord Evandale ought to have remembered," said Edith, "that when his
perseverance, and, I must add, a due sense of his merit and of the
obligations we owed him, wrung from me a slow consent that I would one
day comply with his wishes, I made it my condition that I should not be
pressed to a hasty accomplishment of my promise; and now he avails
himself of his interest with my only remaining relative to hurry me with
precipitate and even indelicate importunity.There is more selfishness
than generosity, my lord, in such eager and urgent solicitation."Lord Evandale, evidently much hurt, took two or three turns through the
apartment ere he replied to this accusation; at length he spoke: "I
should have escaped this painful charge, durst I at once have mentioned
to Miss Bellendon my principal reason for urging this request.It is one
which she will probably despise on her own account, but which ought to
weigh with her for the sake of Lady Margaret.My death in battle must
give my whole estate to my heirs of entail; my forfeiture as a traitor,
by the usurping Government, may vest it in the Prince of Orange or some
Dutch favourite.In either case, my venerable friend and betrothed bride
must remain unprotected and in poverty.Vested with the rights and
provisions of Lady Evandale, Edith will find, in the power of supporting
her aged parent, some consolation for having condescended to share the
titles and fortunes of one who does not pretend to be worthy of her."Edith was struck dumb by an argument which she had not expected, and was
compelled to acknowledge that Lord Evandale's suit was urged with
delicacy as well as with consideration."And yet," she said, "such is the waywardness with which my heart reverts
to former times that I cannot," she burst into tears, "suppress a degree
of ominous reluctance at fulfilling my engagement upon such a brief
summons.""We have already fully considered this painful subject," said Lord
Evandale; "and I hoped, my dear Edith, your own inquiries, as well as
mine, had fully convinced you that these regrets were fruitless."said Edith, with a deep sigh, which, as if by an
unexpected echo, was repeated from the adjoining apartment.Miss
Bellenden started at the sound, and scarcely composed herself upon Lord
Evandale's assurances that she had heard but the echo of her own
respiration."It sounded strangely distinct," she said, "and almost ominous; but my
feelings are so harassed that the slightest trifle agitates them."Lord Evandale eagerly attempted to soothe her alarm, and reconcile her to
a measure which, however hasty, appeared to him the only means by which
he could secure her independence.He urged his claim in virtue of the
contract, her grandmother's wish and command, the propriety of insuring
her comfort and independence, and touched lightly on his own long
attachment, which he had evinced by so many and such various services.These Edith felt the more, the less they were insisted upon; and at
length, as she had nothing to oppose to his ardour, excepting a causeless
reluctance which she herself was ashamed to oppose against so much
generosity, she was compelled to rest upon the impossibility of having
the ceremony performed upon such hasty notice, at such a time and place.But for all this Lord Evandale was prepared, and he explained, with
joyful alacrity, that the former chaplain of his regiment was in
attendance at the Lodge with a faithful domestic, once a non-commissioned
officer in the same corps; that his sister was also possessed of the
secret; and that Headrigg and his wife might be added to the list of
witnesses, if agreeable to Miss Bellenden.As to the place, he had chosen
it on very purpose.The marriage was to remain a secret, since Lord
Evandale was to depart in disguise very soon after it was solemnized,--a
circumstance which, had their union been public, must have drawn upon him
the attention of the Government, as being altogether unaccountable,
unless from his being engaged in some dangerous design.Having hastily
urged these motives and explained his arrangements, he ran, without
waiting for an answer, to summon his sister to attend his bride, while he
went in search of the other persons whose presence was necessary.When Lady Emily arrived, she found her friend in an agony of tears, of
which she was at some loss to comprehend the reason, being one of those
damsels who think there is nothing either wonderful or terrible in
matrimony, and joining with most who knew him in thinking that it could
not be rendered peculiarly alarming by Lord Evandale being the
bridegroom.Influenced by these feelings, she exhausted in succession all
the usual arguments for courage, and all the expressions of sympathy and
condolence ordinarily employed on such occasions.But when Lady Emily
beheld her future sister-in-law deaf to all those ordinary topics of
consolation; when she beheld tears follow fast and without intermission
down cheeks as pale as marble; when she felt that the hand which she
pressed in order to enforce her arguments turned cold within her grasp,
and lay, like that of a corpse, insensible and unresponsive to her
caresses, her feelings of sympathy gave way to those of hurt pride and
pettish displeasure."I must own," she said, "that I am something at a loss to understand all
this, Miss Bellenden.Months have passed since you agreed to marry my
brother, and you have postponed the fulfilment of your engagement from
one period to another, as if you had to avoid some dishonourable or
highly disagreeable connection.I think I can answer for Lord Evandale
that he will seek no woman's hand against her inclination; and, though
his sister, I may boldly say that he does not need to urge any lady
further than her inclinations carry her.You will forgive me, Miss
Bellenden; but your present distress augurs ill for my brother's future
happiness, and I must needs say that he does not merit all these
expressions of dislike and dolour, and that they seem an odd return for
an attachment which he has manifested so long, and in so many ways.""You are right, Lady Emily," said Edith, drying her eyes and endeavouring
to resume her natural manner, though still betrayed by her faltering
voice and the paleness of her cheeks,--"you are quite right; Lord
Evandale merits such usage from no one, least of all from her whom he has
honoured with his regard.But if I have given way, for the last time, to
a sudden and irresistible burst of feeling, it is my consolation, Lady
Emily, that your brother knows the cause, that I have hid nothing from
him, and that he at least is not apprehensive of finding in Edith
Bellenden a wife undeserving of his affection.But still you are right,
and I merit your censure for indulging for a moment fruitless regret and
painful remembrances.It shall be so no longer; my lot is cast with
Evandale, and with him I am resolved to bear it.Nothing shall in future
occur to excite his complaints or the resentment of his relations; no
idle recollections of other days shall intervene to prevent the zealous
and affectionate discharge of my duty; no vain illusions recall the
memory of other days--"

As she spoke these words, she slowly raised her eyes, which had before
been hidden by her hand, to the latticed window of her apartment, which
was partly open, uttered a dismal shriek, and fainted.Lady Emily turned
her eyes in the same direction, but saw only the shadow of a man, which
seemed to disappear from the window, and, terrified more by the state of
Edith than by the apparition she had herself witnessed, she uttered
shriek upon shriek for assistance.Her brother soon arrived, with the
chaplain and Jenny Dennison; but strong and vigorous remedies were
necessary ere they could recall Miss Bellenden to sense and motion.Even
then her language was wild and incoherent.[Illustration: Uttered A Dismal Shriek, And Fainted--224]


"Press me no farther," she said to Lord Evandale,--"it cannot be; Heaven
and earth, the living and the dead, have leagued themselves against this
ill-omened union.Take all I can give,--my sisterly regard, my devoted
friendship.I will love you as a sister and serve you as a bondswoman,
but never speak to me more of marriage."The astonishment of Lord Evandale may easily be conceived."Emily," he said to his sister, "this is your doing.I was accursed when
I thought of bringing you here; some of your confounded folly has driven
her mad!""On my word, Brother," answered Lady Emily, "you're sufficient to drive
all the women in Scotland mad.Because your mistress seems much disposed
to jilt you, you quarrel with your sister, who has been arguing in your
cause, and had brought her to a quiet hearing, when, all of a sudden, a
man looked in at a window, whom her crazed sensibility mistook either for
you or some one else, and has treated us gratis with an excellent tragic
scene."said Lord Evandale, in impatient displeasure."Miss Bellenden is incapable of trifling with me; and yet what else could
have--"

"Hush!said Jenny, whose interest lay particularly in shifting
further inquiry; "for Heaven's sake, my lord, speak low, for my lady
begins to recover."Edith was no sooner somewhat restored to herself than she begged, in a
feeble voice, to be left alone with Lord Evandale.All retreated,--Jenny
with her usual air of officious simplicity, Lady Emily and the chaplain
with that of awakened curiosity.No sooner had they left the apartment
than Edith beckoned Lord Evandale to sit beside her on the couch; her
next motion was to take his hand, in spite of his surprised resistance,
to her lips; her last was to sink from her seat and to clasp his knees.I must deal most
untruly by you, and break a solemn engagement.You have my friendship, my
highest regard, my most sincere gratitude; you have more,--you have my
word and my faith; but--oh, forgive me, for the fault is not mine--you
have not my love, and I cannot marry you without a sin!""You dream, my dearest Edith!"said Evandale, perplexed in the utmost
degree, "you let your imagination beguile you; this is but some delusion
of an over-sensitive mind.The person whom you preferred to me has been
long in a better world, where your unavailing regret cannot follow him,
or, if it could, would only diminish his happiness.""You are mistaken, Lord Evandale," said Edith, solemnly; "I am not a
sleep-walker or a madwoman.No, I could not have believed from any one
what I have seen.But, having seen him, I must believe mine own eyes."asked Lord Evandale, in great anxiety."Henry Morton," replied Edith, uttering these two words as if they were
her last, and very nearly fainting when she had done so."Miss Bellenden," said Lord Evandale, "you treat me like a fool or a
child.If you repent your engagement to me," he continued, indignantly,
"I am not a man to enforce it against your inclination; but deal with me
as a man, and forbear this trifling."He was about to go on, when he perceived, from her quivering eye and
pallid cheek, that nothing less than imposture was intended, and that by
whatever means her imagination had been so impressed, it was really
disturbed by unaffected awe and terror.He changed his tone, and exerted
all his eloquence in endeavouring to soothe and extract from her the
secret cause of such terror.she repeated,--"I saw Henry Morton stand at that window, and
look into the apartment at the moment I was on the point of abjuring him
for ever.His face was darker, thinner, and paler than it was wont to be;
his dress was a horseman's cloak, and hat looped down over his face; his
expression was like that he wore on that dreadful morning when he was
examined by Claverhouse at Tillietudlem.Ask your sister, ask Lady Emily,
if she did not see him as well as I. I know what has called him up,--he
came to upbraid me, that, while my heart was with him in the deep and
dead sea, I was about to give my hand to another.My lord, it is ended
between you and me; be the consequences what they will, she cannot marry
whose union disturbs the repose of the dead."said Evandale, as he paced the room, half mad himself with
surprise and vexation, "her fine understanding must be totally
overthrown, and that by the effort which she has made to comply with my
ill-timed, though well-meant, request.Without rest and attention her
health is ruined for ever."At this moment the door opened, and Halliday, who had been Lord
Evandale's principal personal attendant since they both left the Guards
on the Revolution, stumbled into the room with a countenance as pale and
ghastly as terror could paint it."What is the matter next, Halliday?""Any
discovery of the--"

He had just recollection sufficient to stop short in the midst of the
dangerous sentence."No, sir," said Halliday, "it is not that, nor anything like that; but I
have seen a ghost!"said Lord Evandale, forced altogether out
of his patience."Has all mankind sworn to go mad in order to drive me
so?"The ghost of Henry Morton, the Whig captain at Bothwell Bridge," replied
Halliday."He passed by me like a fire-flaught when I was in the garden!""This is midsummer madness," said Lord Evandale, "or there is some
strange villainy afloat.Jenny, attend your lady to her chamber, while I
endeavour to find a clue to all this."But Lord Evandale's inquiries were in vain.Jenny, who might have given
(had she chosen) a very satisfactory explanation, had an interest to
leave the matter in darkness; and interest was a matter which now weighed
principally with Jenny, since the possession of an active and
affectionate husband in her own proper right had altogether allayed her
spirit of coquetry.She had made the best use of the first moments of
confusion hastily to remove all traces of any one having slept in the
apartment adjoining to the parlour, and even to erase the mark of
footsteps beneath the window, through which she conjectured Morton's face
had been seen, while attempting, ere he left the garden, to gain one look
at her whom he had so long loved, and was now on the point of losing for
ever.That he had passed Halliday in the garden was equally clear; and
she learned from her elder boy, whom she had employed to have the
stranger's horse saddled and ready for his departure, that he had rushed
into the stable, thrown the child a broad gold piece, and, mounting his
horse, had ridden with fearful rapidity down towards the Clyde.The
secret was, therefore, in their own family, and Jenny was resolved it
should remain so."For, to be sure," she said, "although her lady and Halliday kend Mr.Morton by broad daylight, that was nae reason I suld own to kenning him
in the gloaming and by candlelight, and him keeping his face frae Cuddie
and me a' the time."So she stood resolutely upon the negative when examined by Lord Evandale.As for Halliday, he could only say that as he entered the garden-door,
the supposed apparition met him, walking swiftly, and with a visage on
which anger and grief appeared to be contending."He knew him well," he said, "having been repeatedly guard upon him, and
obliged to write down his marks of stature and visage in case of escape.But what should make him
haunt the country where he was neither hanged nor shot, he, the said
Halliday, did not pretend to conceive.Lady Emily confessed she had seen the face of a man at the window, but
her evidence went no farther.John Gudyill deponed _nil novit in causa_.He had left his gardening to get his morning dram just at the time when
the apparition had taken place.Lady Emily's servant was waiting orders
in the kitchen, and there was not another being within a quarter of a
mile of the house.Lord Evandale returned perplexed and dissatisfied in the highest degree
at beholding a plan which he thought necessary not less for the
protection of Edith in contingent circumstances, than for the assurance
of his own happiness, and which he had brought so very near perfection,
thus broken off without any apparent or rational cause.His knowledge of
Edith's character set her beyond the suspicion of covering any capricious
change of determination by a pretended vision.But he would have set the
apparition down to the influence of an overstrained imagination, agitated
by the circumstances in which she had so suddenly been placed, had it not
been for the coinciding testimony of Halliday, who had no reason for
thinking of Morton more than any other person, and knew nothing of Miss
Bellenden's vision when he promulgated his own.On the other hand, it
seemed in the highest degree improbable that Morton, so long and so
vainly sought after, and who was, with such good reason, supposed to be
lost when the "Vryheid" of Rotterdam went down with crew and passengers,
should be alive and lurking in this country, where there was no longer
any reason why he should not openly show himself, since the present
Government favoured his party in politics.When Lord Evandale reluctantly
brought himself to communicate these doubts to the chaplain, in order to
obtain his opinion, he could only obtain a long lecture on demonology, in
which, after quoting Delrio and Burthoog and De L'Ancre on the subject of
apparitions, together with sundry civilians and common lawyers on the
nature of testimony, the learned gentleman expressed his definite and
determined opinion to be, either that there had been an actual apparition
of the deceased Henry Morton's spirit, the possibility of which he was,
as a divine and a philosopher, neither fully prepared to admit or to
deny; or else that the said Henry Morton, being still in _rerum natura_,
had appeared in his proper person that morning; or, finally, that some
strong _deceptio visus_, or striking similitude of person, had deceived
the eyes of Miss Bellenden and of Thomas Halliday.Which of these was the
most probable hypothesis, the doctor declined to pronounce, but expressed
himself ready to die in the opinion that one or other of them had
occasioned that morning's disturbance.Lord Evandale soon had additional cause for distressful anxiety.Miss
Bellenden was declared to be dangerously ill."I will not leave this place," he exclaimed, "till she is pronounced to
be in safety.I neither can nor ought to do so; for whatever may have
been the immediate occasion of her illness, I gave the first cause for it
by my unhappy solicitation."He established himself, therefore, as a guest in the family, which the
presence of his sister, as well as of Lady Margaret Bellenden (who, in
despite of her rheumatism, caused herself to be transported thither when
she heard of her granddaughter's illness), rendered a step equally
natural and delicate.And thus he anxiously awaited until, without injury
to her health, Edith could sustain a final explanation ere his departure
on his expedition."She shall never," said the generous young man, "look on her engagement
with me as the means of fettering her to a union, the idea of which seems
almost to unhinge her understanding."Where once my careless childhood strayed,
               A stranger yet to pain.Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College.It is not by corporal wants and infirmities only that men of the most
distinguished talents are levelled, during their lifetime, with the
common mass of mankind.There are periods of mental agitation when the
firmest of mortals must be ranked with the weakest of his brethren, and
when, in paying the general tax of humanity, his distresses are even
aggravated by feeling that he transgresses, in the indulgence of his
grief, the rules of religion and philosophy by which he endeavours in
general to regulate his passions and his actions.It was during such a
paroxysm that the unfortunate Morton left Fairy Knowe.To know that his
long-loved and still-beloved Edith, whose image had filled his mind for
so many years, was on the point of marriage to his early rival, who had
laid claim to her heart by so many services as hardly left her a title to
refuse his addresses, bitter as the intelligence was, yet came not as an
unexpected blow.During his residence abroad he had once written to Edith.It was to bid
her farewell for ever, and to conjure her to forget him.He had requested
her not to answer his letter; yet he half hoped, for many a day, that she
might transgress his injunction.The letter never reached her to whom it
was addressed, and Morton, ignorant of its miscarriage, could only
conclude himself laid aside and forgotten, according to his own
self-denying request.All that he had heard of their mutual relations
since his return to Scotland prepared him to expect that he could only
look upon Miss Bellenden as the betrothed bride of Lord Evandale; and
even if freed from the burden of obligation to the latter, it would still
have been inconsistent with Morton's generosity of disposition to disturb
their arrangements, by attempting the assertion of a claim proscribed by
absence, never sanctioned by the consent of friends, and barred by a
thousand circumstances of difficulty.Why then did he seek the cottage
which their broken fortunes had now rendered the retreat of Lady Margaret
Bellenden and her granddaughter?He yielded, we are under the necessity
of acknowledging, to the impulse of an inconsistent wish which many might
have felt in his situation.Accident apprised him, while travelling towards his native district, that
the ladies, near whose mansion he must necessarily pass, were absent; and
learning that Cuddie and his wife acted as their principal domestics, he
could not resist pausing at their cottage to learn, if possible, the real
progress which Lord Evandale had made in the affections of Miss Bellen
den--alas!This rash experiment ended as we have
related, and he parted from the house of Fairy Knowe, conscious that he
was still beloved by Edith, yet compelled, by faith and honour, to
relinquish her for ever.With what feelings he must have listened to the
dialogue between Lord Evandale and Edith, the greater part of which he
involuntarily overheard, the reader must conceive, for we dare not
attempt to describe them.An hundred times he was tempted to burst upon
their interview, or to exclaim aloud, "Edith, I yet live!"and as often
the recollection of her plighted troth, and of the debt of gratitude
which he owed Lord Evandale (to whose influence with Claverhouse he
justly ascribed his escape from torture and from death), withheld him
from a rashness which might indeed have involved all in further distress,
but gave little prospect of forwarding his own happiness.He repressed
forcibly these selfish emotions, though with an agony which thrilled his
every nerve.was his internal oath, "never will I add a thorn to thy
pillow.That which Heaven has ordained, let it be; and let me not add, by
my selfish sorrows, one atom's weight to the burden thou hast to bear.I
was dead to thee when thy resolution was adopted; and never, never shalt
thou know that Henry Morton still lives!"As he formed this resolution, diffident of his own power to keep it, and
seeking that firmness in flight which was every moment shaken by his
continuing within hearing of Edith's voice, he hastily rushed from his
apartment by the little closet and the sashed door which led to the
garden.But firmly as he thought his resolution was fixed, he could not leave the
spot where the last tones of a voice so beloved still vibrated on his
ear, without endeavouring to avail himself of the opportunity which the
parlour window afforded to steal one last glance at the lovely speaker.It was in this attempt, made while Edith seemed to have her eyes
unalterably bent upon the ground, that Morton's presence was detected by
her raising them suddenly.So soon as her wild scream made this known to
the unfortunate object of a passion so constant, and which seemed so
ill-fated, he hurried from the place as if pursued by the furies.He
passed Halliday in the garden without recognising or even being sensible
that he had seen him, threw himself on his horse, and, by a sort of
instinct rather than recollection, took the first by-road in preference
to the public route to Hamilton.In all probability this prevented Lord Evandale from learning that he was
actually in existence; for the news that the Highlanders had obtained a
decisive victory at Killiecrankie had occasioned an accurate look-out to
be kept, by order of the Government, on all the passes, for fear of some
commotion among the Lowland Jacobites.They did not omit to post
sentinels on Bothwell Bridge; and as these men had not seen any traveller
pass westward in that direction, and as, besides, their comrades
stationed in the village of Bothwell were equally positive that none had
gone eastward, the apparition, in the existence of which Edith and
Halliday were equally positive, became yet more mysterious in the
judgment of Lord Evandale, who was finally inclined to settle in the
belief that the heated and disturbed imagination of Edith had summoned up
the phantom she stated herself to have seen, and that Halliday had, in
some unaccountable manner, been infected by the same superstition.Meanwhile, the by-path which Morton pursued, with all the speed which his
vigorous horse could exert, brought him in a very few seconds to the
brink of the Clyde, at a spot marked with the feet of horses, who were
conducted to it as a watering-place.The steed, urged as he was to the
gallop, did not pause a single instant, but, throwing himself into the
river, was soon beyond his depth.The plunge which the animal made as his
feet quitted the ground, with the feeling that the cold water rose above
his swordbelt, were the first incidents which recalled Morton, whose
movements had been hitherto mechanical, to the necessity of taking
measures for preserving himself and the noble animal which he bestrode.A
perfect master of all manly exercises, the management of a horse in water
was as familiar to him as when upon a meadow.He directed the animal's
course somewhat down the stream towards a low plain, or holm, which
seemed to promise an easy egress from the river.In the first and second
attempt to get on shore, the horse was frustrated by the nature of the
ground, and nearly fell backwards on his rider.The instinct of
self-preservation seldom fails, even in the most desperate circumstances,
to recall the human mind to some degree of equipoise, unless when
altogether distracted by terror, and Morton was obliged to the danger in
which he was placed for complete recovery of his self-possession.A third
attempt, at a spot more carefully and judiciously selected, succeeded
better than the former, and placed the horse and his rider in safety upon
the farther and left-hand bank of the Clyde."But whither," said Morton, in the bitterness of his heart, "am I now to
direct my course?or rather, what does it signify to which point of the
compass a wretch so forlorn betakes himself?I would to God, could the
wish be without a sin, that these dark waters had flowed over me, and
drowned my recollection of that which was, and that which is!"The sense of impatience, which the disturbed state of his feelings had
occasioned, scarcely had vented itself in these violent expressions, ere
he was struck with shame at having given way to such a paroxysm.He
remembered how signally the life which he now held so lightly in the
bitterness of his disappointment had been preserved through the almost
incessant perils which had beset him since he entered upon his public
career.he said, "and worse than a fool, to set light by that
existence which Heaven has so often preserved in the most marvellous
manner.Something there yet remains for me in this world, were it only to
bear my sorrows like a man, and to aid those who need my assistance.What
have I seen, what have I heard, but the very conclusion of that which I
knew was to happen?They"--he durst not utter their names even in
soliloquy--"they are embarrassed and in difficulties.She is stripped of
her inheritance, and he seems rushing on some dangerous career, with
which, but for the low voice in which he spoke, I might have become
acquainted.Are there no means to aid or to warn them?"As he pondered upon this topic, forcibly withdrawing his mind from his
own disappointment, and compelling his attention to the affairs of Edith
and her betrothed husband, the letter of Burley, long forgotten, suddenly
rushed on his memory, like a ray of light darting through a mist."Their ruin must have been his work," was his internal conclusion."If it
can be repaired, it must be through his means, or by information obtained
from him.Stern, crafty, and enthusiastic as he
is, my plain and downright rectitude of purpose has more than once
prevailed with him.I will seek him out, at least; and who knows what
influence the information I may acquire from him may have on the fortunes
of those whom I shall never see more, and who will probably never learn
that I am now suppressing my own grief, to add, if possible, to their
happiness."Animated by these hopes, though the foundation was but slight, he sought
the nearest way to the high-road; and as all the tracks through the
valley were known to him since he hunted through them in youth, he had no
other difficulty than that of surmounting one or two enclosures, ere he
found himself on the road to the small burgh where the feast of the
popinjay had been celebrated.He journeyed in a state of mind sad indeed
and dejected, yet relieved from its earlier and more intolerable state of
anguish; for virtuous resolution and manly disinterestedness seldom fail
to restore tranquillity even where they cannot create happiness.He
turned his thoughts with strong effort upon the means of discovering
Burley, and the chance there was of extracting from him any knowledge
which he might possess favourable to her in whose cause he interested
himself; and at length formed the resolution of guiding himself by the
circumstances in which he might discover the object of his quest,
trusting that, from Cuddie's account of a schism betwixt Burley and his
brethren of the Presbyterian persuasion, he might find him less
rancorously disposed against Miss Bellenden, and inclined to exert the
power which he asserted himself to possess over her fortunes, more
favourably than heretofore.Noontide had passed away when our traveller found himself in the
neighbourhood of his deceased uncle's habitation of Milnwood.It rose
among glades and groves that were chequered with a thousand early
recollections of joy and sorrow, and made upon Morton that mournful
impression, soft and affecting, yet, withal, soothing, which the
sensitive mind usually receives from a return to the haunts of childhood
and early youth, after having experienced the vicissitudes and tempests
of public life.A strong desire came upon him to visit the house itself."Old Alison," he thought, "will not know me, more than the honest couple
whom I saw yesterday.I may indulge my curiosity, and proceed on my
journey, without her having any knowledge of my existence.I think they
said my uncle had bequeathed to her my family mansion,--well, be it so.I
have enough to sorrow for, to enable me to dispense with lamenting such a
disappointment as that; and yet methinks he has chosen an odd successor
in my grumbling old dame, to a line of respectable, if not distinguished,
ancestry.Let it be as it may, I will visit the old mansion at least once
more."The house of Milnwood, even in its best days, had nothing cheerful about
it; but its gloom appeared to be doubled under the auspices of the old
housekeeper.Everything, indeed, was in repair; there were no slates
deficient upon the steep grey roof, and no panes broken in the narrow
windows.But the grass in the court-yard looked as if the foot of man had
not been there for years; the doors were carefully locked, and that which
admitted to the hall seemed to have been shut for a length of time, since
the spiders had fairly drawn their webs over the door-way and the
staples.Living sight or sound there was none, until, after much
knocking, Morton heard the little window, through which it was
usual to reconnoitre visitors, open with much caution.The face of
Alison, puckered with some score of wrinkles in addition to those with
which it was furrowed when Morton left Scotland, now presented itself,
enveloped in a _toy_, from under the protection of which some of her grey
tresses had escaped in a manner more picturesque than beautiful, while
her shrill, tremulous voice demanded the cause of the knocking."I wish to speak an instant with one Alison Wilson, who resides here,"
said Henry."She's no at hame the day," answered Mrs.Wilson, _in propria persona_,
the state of whose headdress, perhaps, inspired her with this direct mode
of denying herself; "and ye are but a mislear'd person to speer for her
in sic a manner.Ye might hae had an M under your belt for Mistress
Wilson of Milnwood.""I beg pardon," said Morton, internally smiling at finding in old Ailie
the same jealousy of disrespect which she used to exhibit upon former
occasions,--"I beg pardon; I am but a stranger in this country, and have
been so long abroad that I have almost forgotten my own language."said Ailie; "then maybe ye may hae
heard of a young gentleman of this country that they ca' Henry Morton?""I have heard," said Morton, "of such a name in Germany.""Then bide a wee bit where ye are, friend; or stay,--gang round by the
back o' the house, and ye'll find a laigh door; it's on the latch, for
it's never barred till sunset.Ye 'll open 't,--and tak care ye dinna fa'
ower the tub, for the entry's dark,--and then ye'll turn to the right,
and then ye'll hand straught forward, and then ye'll turn to the right
again, and ye 'll tak heed o' the cellarstairs, and then ye 'll be at the
door o' the little kitchen,--it's a' the kitchen that's at Milnwood
now,--and I'll come down t'ye, and whate'er ye wad say to Mistress
Wilson ye may very safely tell it to me."A stranger might have had some difficulty, notwithstanding the minuteness
of the directions supplied by Ailie, to pilot himself in safety through
the dark labyrinth of passages that led from the back-door to the little
kitchen; but Henry was too well acquainted with the navigation of these
straits to experience danger, either from the Scylla which lurked on one
side in shape of a bucking tub, or the Charybdis which yawned on the
other in the profundity of a winding cellar-stair.His only impediment
arose from the snarling and vehement barking of a small cocking spaniel,
once his own property, but which, unlike to the faithful Argus, saw his
master return from his wanderings without any symptom of recognition.said Morton to himself, on being disowned by
his former favourite."I am so changed that no breathing creature that I
have known and loved will now acknowledge me!"At this moment he had reached the kitchen; and soon after, the tread of
Alison's high heels, and the pat of the crutch-handled cane which served
at once to prop and to guide her footsteps, were heard upon the
stairs,--an annunciation which continued for some time ere she fairly
reached the kitchen.Morton had, therefore, time to survey the slender preparations for
housekeeping which were now sufficient in the house of his ancestors.The
fire, though coals are plenty in that neighbourhood, was husbanded with
the closest attention to economy of fuel, and the small pipkin, in which
was preparing the dinner of the old woman and her maid-of-all-work, a
girl of twelve years old, intimated, by its thin and watery vapour, that
Ailie had not mended her cheer with her improved fortune.When she entered, the head, which nodded with self-importance; the
features, in which an irritable peevishness, acquired by habit and
indulgence, strove with a temper naturally affectionate and good-natured;
the coif; the apron; the blue-checked gown,--were all those of old Ailie;
but laced pinners, hastily put on to meet the stranger, with some other
trifling articles of decoration, marked the difference between Mrs.Wilson, life-rentrix of Milnwood, and the housekeeper of the late
proprietor."What were ye pleased to want wi' Mrs.Wilson,"
was her first address; for the five minutes time which she had gained for
the business of the toilet entitled her, she conceived, to assume the
full merit of her illustrious name, and shine forth on her guest in
unchastened splendour.Morton's sensations, confounded between the past
and present, fairly confused him so much that he would have had
difficulty in answering her, even if he had known well what to say.But
as he had not determined what character he was to adopt while concealing
that which was properly his own, he had an additional reason for
remaining silent.Wilson, in perplexity, and with some apprehension,
repeated her question."What were ye pleased to want wi' me, sir?"Pardon me, madam," answered Henry, "it was of one Silas Morton I spoke.""It was his father, then, ye kent o', the brother o' the late Milnwood?Ye canna mind him abroad, I wad think,--he was come hame afore ye were
born.I thought ye had brought me news of poor Maister Harry.""It was from my father I learned to know Colonel Morton," said Henry; "of
the son I know little or nothing,--rumour says he died abroad on his
passage to Holland.""That's ower like to be true," said the old woman with a sigh, "and mony
a tear it's cost my auld een.His uncle, poor gentleman, just sough'd awa
wi' it in his mouth.He had been gieing me preceeze directions anent the
bread and the wine and the brandy at his burial, and how often it was to
be handed round the company (for, dead or alive, he was a prudent,
frugal, painstaking man), and then he said, said he, 'Ailie,' (he aye
ca'd me Ailie; we were auld acquaintance), 'Ailie, take ye care and haud
the gear weel thegither; for the name of Morton of Milnwood's gane out
like the last sough of an auld sang.'And sae he fell out o' ae dwam into
another, and ne'er spak a word mair, unless it were something we cou'dna
mak out, about a dipped candle being gude eneugh to see to dee wi'.He
cou'd ne'er bide to see a moulded ane, and there was ane, by ill luck, on
the table."Wilson was thus detailing the last moments of the old miser,
Morton was pressingly engaged in diverting the assiduous curiosity of the
dog, which, recovered from his first surprise, and combining former
recollections, had, after much snuffing and examination, begun a course
of capering and jumping upon the stranger which threatened every instant
to betray him.At length, in the urgency of his impatience, Morton could
not forbear exclaiming, in a tone of hasty impatience, "Down, Elphin!"Ye ken our dog's name," said the old lady, struck with great and sudden
surprise,--"ye ken our dog's name, and it's no a common ane.And the
creature kens you too," she continued, in a more agitated and shriller
tone,--"God guide us!So saying, the poor old woman threw herself around Morton's neck, cling
to him, kissed him as if he had been actually her child, and wept for
joy.There was no parrying the discovery, if he could have had the heart
to attempt any further disguise.He returned the embrace with the most
grateful warmth, and answered,--

"I do indeed live, dear Ailie, to thank you for all your kindness, past
and present, and to rejoice that there is at least one friend to welcome
me to my native country."exclaimed Ailie, "ye'll hae mony friends,--ye 'll hae mony
friends; for ye will hae gear, hinny,--ye will hae gear.Heaven mak ye a
gude guide o't!she continued, pushing him back from her
with her trembling hand and shrivelled arm, and gazing in his face as if
to read, at more convenient distance, the ravages which sorrow rather
than time had made on his face,--"Eh, sirs!ye're sair altered, hinny;
your face is turned pale, and your een are sunken, and your bonny
red-and-white cheeks are turned a' dark and sun-burnt.mony's the comely face they destroy.--And when cam ye here, hinny?And what for did ye na
write to us?And how cam ye to pass yoursell for dead?And what for did
ye come creepin' to your ain house as if ye had been an unto body, to gie
poor auld Ailie sic a start?"It was some time ere Morton could overcome his own emotion so as to give
the kind old woman the information which we shall communicate to our
readers in the next chapter.Aumerle that was,
               But that is gone for being Richard's friend;
               And, madam, you must call him Rutland now.The scene of explanation was hastily removed from the little kitchen to
Mrs.Wilson's own matted room,--the very same which she had occupied as
housekeeper, and which she continued to retain."It was," she said,
"better secured against sifting winds than the hall, which she had found
dangerous to her rheumatisms, and it was more fitting for her use than
the late Milnwood's apartment, honest man, which gave her sad thoughts;"
and as for the great oak parlour, it was never opened but to be aired,
washed, and dusted, according to the invariable practice of the family,
unless upon their most solemn festivals.In the matted room, therefore,
they were settled, surrounded by pickle-pots and conserves of all kinds,
which the ci-devant housekeeper continued to compound, out of mere habit,
although neither she herself, nor any one else, ever partook of the
comfits which she so regularly prepared.Morton, adapting his narrative to the comprehension of his auditor,
informed her briefly of the wreck of the vessel and the loss of all
hands, excepting two or three common seamen who had early secured the
skiff, and were just putting off from the vessel when he leaped from the
deck into their boat, and unexpectedly, as well as contrary to their
inclination, made himself partner of their voyage and of their safety.Landed at Flushing, he was fortunate enough to meet with an old officer
who had been in service with his father.By his advice, he shunned going
immediately to the Hague, but forwarded his letters to the court of the
Stadtholder."Our prince," said the veteran, "must as yet keep terms with his
father-in-law and with your King Charles; and to approach him in the
character of a Scottish malecontent would render it imprudent for him to
distinguish you by his favour.Wait, therefore, his orders, without
forcing yourself on his notice; observe the strictest prudence and
retirement; assume for the present a different name; shun the company of
the British exiles; and, depend upon it, you will not repent your
prudence."The old friend of Silas Morton argued justly.After a considerable time
had elapsed, the Prince of Orange, in a progress through the United
States, came to the town where Morton, impatient at his situation and the
incognito which he was obliged to observe, still continued, nevertheless,
to be a resident.He had an hour of private interview assigned, in which
the prince expressed himself highly pleased with his intelligence, his
prudence, and the liberal view which he seemed to take of the factions of
his native country, their motives and their purposes."I would gladly," said William, "attach you to my own person; but that
cannot be without giving offence in England.But I will do as much for
you, as well out of respect for the sentiments you have expressed, as for
the recommendations you have brought me.Here is a commission in a Swiss
regiment at present in garrison in a distant province, where you will
meet few or none of your countrymen.Continue to be Captain Melville, and
let the name of Morton sleep till better days.""Thus began my fortune," continued Morton; "and my services have, on
various occasions, been distinguished by his Royal Highness, until the
moment that brought him to Britain as our political deliverer.His
commands must excuse my silence to my few friends in Scotland; and I
wonder not at the report of my death, considering the wreck of the
vessel, and that I found no occasion to use the letters of exchange with
which I was furnished by the liberality of some of them,--a circumstance
which must have confirmed the belief that I had perished.""But, dear hinny," asked Mrs.Wilson, "did ye find nae Scotch body at the
Prince of Oranger's court that kend ye?I wad hae thought Morton o'
Milnwood was kend a' through the country.""I was purposely engaged in distant service," said Morton, "until a
period when few, without as deep and kind a motive of interest as yours,
Ailie, would have known the stripling Morton in Major-General Melville.""Malville was your mother's name," said Mrs.Wilson; "but Morton sounds
far bonnier in my auld lugs.And when ye tak up the lairdship, ye maun
tak the auld name and designation again.""I am like to be in no haste to do either the one or the other, Ailie,
for I have some reasons for the present to conceal my being alive from
every one but you; and as for the lairdship of Milnwood, it is in as good
hands.""As gude hands, hinny!"re-echoed Ailie; "I'm hopefu' ye are no meaning
mine?The rents and the lands are but a sair fash to me.And I'm ower
failed to tak a helpmate, though Wylie Mactrickit the writer was very
pressing, and spak very civilly; but I'm ower auld a cat to draw that
strae before me.He canna whilliwhaw me as he's dune mony a ane.And then
I thought aye ye wad come back, and I wad get my pickle meal and my soup
milk, and keep a' things right about ye as I used to do in your puir
uncle's time, and it wad be just pleasure eneugh for me to see ye thrive
and guide the gear canny.Ye'll hae learned that in Holland, I'se
warrant, for they're thrifty folk there, as I hear tell.--But ye'll be
for keeping rather a mair house than puir auld Milnwood that's gave; and,
indeed, I would approve o' your eating butchermeat maybe as aften as
three times a-week,--it keeps the wind out o' the stamack.""We will talk of all this another time," said Morton, surprised at the
generosity upon a large scale which mingled in Ailie's thoughts and
actions with habitual and sordid parsimony, and at the odd contrast
between her love of saving and indifference to self-acquisition."You
must know," he continued, "that I am in this country only for a few days
on some special business of importance to the Government, and therefore,
Ailie, not a word of having seen me.At some other time I will acquaint
you fully with my motives and intentions.""E'en be it sae, my jo," replied Ailie, "I can keep a secret like my
neighbours; and weel auld Milnwood kend it, honest man, for he tauld me
where he keepit his gear, and that's what maist folk like to hae as
private as possibly may be.--But come awa wi' me, hinny, till I show ye
the oak-parlour how grandly it's keepit, just as if ye had been expected
haine every day,--I loot naebody sort it but my ain hands.It was a kind
o' divertisement to me, though whiles the tear wan into my ee, and I said
to mysell, What needs I fash wi' grates and carpets and cushions and the
muckle brass candlesticks ony mair?for they'll ne'er come hame that
aught it rightfully."With these words she hauled him away to this sanctum sanctorum, the
scrubbing and cleaning whereof was her daily employment, as its high
state of good order constituted the very pride of her heart.Morton, as
he followed her into the room, underwent a rebuke for not "dighting his
shune," which showed that Ailie had not relinquished her habits of
authority.On entering the oak-parlour he could not but recollect the
feelings of solemn awe with which, when a boy, he had been affected at
his occasional and rare admission to an apartment which he then supposed
had not its equal save in the halls of princes.It may be readily
supposed that the worked-worsted chairs, with their short ebony legs and
long upright backs, had lost much of their influence over his mind; that
the large brass andirons seemed diminished in splendour; that the green
worsted tapestry appeared no masterpiece of the Arras loom; and that the
room looked, on the whole, dark, gloomy, and disconsolate.Yet there were
two objects, "The counterfeit presentment of two brothers," which,
dissimilar as those described by Hamlet, affected his mind with a variety
of sensations.One full-length portrait represented his father in
complete armour, with a countenance indicating his masculine and
determined character; and the other set forth his uncle, in velvet and
brocade, looking as if he were ashamed of his own finery, though entirely
indebted for it to the liberality of the painter."It was an idle fancy," Ailie said, "to dress the honest auld man in thae
expensive fal-lalls that he ne'er wore in his life, instead o' his douce
Raploch grey, and his band wi' the narrow edging."In private, Morton could not help being much of her opinion; for anything
approaching to the dress of a gentleman sate as ill on the ungainly
person of his relative as an open or generous expression would have done
on his mean and money-making features.He now extricated himself from
Ailie to visit some of his haunts in the neighbouring wood, while her own
hands made an addition to the dinner she was preparing,--an incident no
otherwise remarkable than as it cost the life of a fowl, which, for any
event of less importance than the arrival of Henry Morton, might have
cackled on to a good old age ere Ailie could have been guilty of the
extravagance of killing and dressing it.The meal was seasoned by talk of
old times and by the plans which Ailie laid out for futurity, in which
she assigned her young master all the prudential habits of her old one,
and planned out the dexterity with which she was to exercise her duty as
governante.Morton let the old woman enjoy her day-dreams and
castle-building during moments of such pleasure, and deferred till some
fitter occasion the communication of his purpose again to return and
spend his life upon the Continent.His next care was to lay aside his military dress, which he considered
likely to render more difficult his researches after Burley.He exchanged
it--for a grey doublet and cloak, formerly his usual attire at Milnwood,
and which Mrs.Wilson produced from a chest of walnut-tree, wherein she
had laid them aside, without forgetting carefully to brush and air them
from time to time.Morton retained his sword and fire-arms, without which
few persons travelled in those unsettled times.When he appeared in his
new attire, Mrs.Wilson was first thankful "that they fitted him sae
decently, since, though he was nae fatter, yet he looked mair manly than
when he was taen frae Milnwood."Next she enlarged on the advantage of saving old clothes to be what she
called "beet-masters to the new," and was far advanced in the history of
a velvet cloak belonging to the late Milnwood, which had first been
converted to a velvet doublet, and then into a pair of breeches, and
appeared each time as good as new, when Morton interrupted her account of
its transmigration to bid her good-by.He gave, indeed, a sufficient shock to her feelings, by expressing the
necessity he was under of proceeding on his journey that evening.And whar wad ye
sleep but in your ain house, after ye hae been sae mony years frae hame?""I feel all the unkindness of it, Ailie, but it must be so; and that was
the reason that I attempted to conceal myself from you, as I suspected
you would not let me part from you so easily.""But whar are ye gaun, then?""Saw e'er mortal een
the like o' you, just to come ae moment, and flee awa like an arrow out
of a bow the neist?""I must go down," replied Morton, "to Niel Blane the Piper's Howff; he
can give me a bed, I suppose?"I'se warrant can he," replied Ailie, "and gar ye pay weel for 't
into the bargain.Laddie, I daresay ye hae lost your wits in thae foreign
parts, to gang and gie siller for a supper and a bed, and might hae baith
for naething, and thanks t' ye for accepting them.""I assure you, Ailie," said Morton, desirous to silence her
remonstrances, "that this is a business of great importance, in which I
may be a great gainer, and cannot possibly be a loser.""I dinna see how that can be, if ye begin by gieing maybe the feck o'
twal shillings Scots for your supper; but young folks are aye
venturesome, and think to get siller that way.My puir auld master took
a surer gate, and never parted wi' it when he had anes gotten 't."Persevering in his desperate resolution, Morton took leave of Ailie, and
mounted his horse to proceed to the little town, after exacting a solemn
promise that she would conceal his return until she again saw or heard
from him."I am not very extravagant," was his natural reflection, as he trotted
slowly towards the town; "but were Ailie and I to set up house together,
as she proposes, I think my profusion would break the good old creature's
heart before a week were out."Where's the jolly host
               You told me of?'T has been my custom ever
               To parley with mine host.Morton reached the borough town without meeting with any remarkable
adventure, and alighted at the little inn.It had occurred to him more
than once, while upon his journey, that his resumption of the dress which
he had worn while a youth, although favourable to his views in other
respects, might render it more difficult for him to remain incognito.But
a few years of campaigns and wandering had so changed his appearance that
he had great confidence that in the grown man, whose brows exhibited the
traces of resolution and considerate thought, none would recognise the
raw and bashful stripling who won the game of the popinjay.The only
chance was that here and there some Whig, whom he had led to battle,
might remember the Captain of the Milnwood Marksmen; but the risk, if
there was any, could not be guarded against.The Howff seemed full and frequented as if possessed of all its old
celebrity.The person and demeanour of Niel Blane, more fat and less
civil than of yore, intimated that he had increased as well in purse as
in corpulence; for in Scotland a landlord's complaisance for his guests
decreases in exact proportion to his rise in the world.His daughter had
acquired the air of a dexterous barmaid, undisturbed by the circumstances
of love and war, so apt to perplex her in the exercise of her vocation.Both showed Morton the degree of attention which could have been expected
by a stranger travelling without attendants, at a time when they were
particularly the badges of distinction.He took upon himself exactly the
character his appearance presented, went to the stable and saw his horse
accommodated, then returned to the house, and seating himself in the
public room (for to request one to himself would, in those days, have
been thought an overweening degree of conceit), he found himself in the
very apartment in which he had some years before celebrated his victory
at the game of the popinjay,--a jocular preferment which led to so many
serious consequences.He felt himself, as may well be supposed, a much changed man since that
festivity; and yet, to look around him, the groups assembled in the Howff
seemed not dissimilar to those which the same scene had formerly
presented.Two or three burghers husbanded their "dribbles o' brandy;"
two or three dragoons lounged over their muddy ale, and cursed the
inactive times that allowed them no better cheer.Their cornet did not,
indeed, play at backgammon with the curate in his cassock, but he drank
a little modicum of _aqua mirabilis_ with the grey-cloaked Presbyterian
minister.The scene was another, and yet the same, differing only in
persons, but corresponding in general character.Let the tide of the world wax or wane as it will, Morton thought as he
looked around him, enough will be found to fill the places which chance
renders vacant; and in the usual occupations and amusements of life,
human beings will succeed each other as leaves upon the same tree, with
the same individual difference and the same general resemblance.After pausing a few minutes, Morton, whose experience had taught him the
readiest mode of securing attention, ordered a pint of claret; and as the
smiling landlord appeared with the pewter measure foaming fresh from the
tap (for bottling wine was not then in fashion), he asked him to sit down
and take a share of the good cheer.This invitation was peculiarly
acceptable to Niel Blane, who, if he did not positively expect it from
every guest not provided with better company, yet received it from many,
and was not a whit abashed or surprised at the summons.He sat down,
along with his guest, in a secluded nook near the chimney; and while he
received encouragement to drink by far the greater share of the liquor
before them, he entered at length, as a part of his expected functions,
upon the news of the country,--the births, deaths, and marriages; the
change of property; the downfall of old families, and the rise of new.But politics, now the fertile source of eloquence, mine host did not care
to mingle in his theme; and it was only in answer to a question of Morton
that he replied, with an air of indifference, "Um!we aye hae sodgers
amang us, mair or less.There's a wheen German horse down at Glasgow
yonder; they ca' their commander Wittybody, or some sic name, though he's
as grave and grewsome an auld Dutchman as e'er I saw."said Morton,--"an old man, with grey hair and
short black moustaches; speaks seldom?""And smokes for ever," replied Niel Blane."I see your honour kens the
man.He may be a very gude man too, for aught I see,--that is,
considering he is a sodger and a Dutchman; but if he were ten generals,
and as mony Wittybodies, he has nae skill in the pipes; he gar'd me stop
in the middle of Torphichen's Rant,--the best piece o' music that ever
bag gae wind to.""But these fellows," said Morton, glancing his eye towards the soldiers
"that were in the apartment, are not of his corps?""Na, na, these are Scotch dragoons," said mine host,--"our ain auld
caterpillars; these were Claver'se's lads a while syne, and wad be again,
maybe, if he had the lang ten in his hand.""Is there not a report of his death?""Troth is there," said the landlord; "your honour is right,--there is sic
a fleeing rumour; but, in my puir opinion, it's lang or the deil die.I
wad hae the folks here look to themsells.If he makes an outbreak, he'll
be doun frae the Hielands or I could drink this glass,--and whare are
they then?A' thae hell-rakers o' dragoons wad be at his whistle in a
moment.Nae doubt they're Willie's men e'en now, as they were James's a
while syne; and reason good,--they fight for their pay; what else hae
they to fight for?They hae neither lands nor houses, I trow.There's ae
gude thing o' the change, or the Revolution, as they ca' it,--folks may
speak out afore thae birkies now, and nae fear o' being hauled awa to the
guard-house, or having the thumikins screwed on your finger-ends, just as
I wad drive the screw through a cork."There was a little pause, when Morton, feeling confident in the progress
he had made in mine host's familiarity, asked, though with the hesitation
proper to one who puts a question on the answer to which rests something
of importance, "Whether Blane knew a woman in that neighbourhood called
Elizabeth Maclure?""Whether I ken Bessie Maclure?"answered the landlord, with a landlord's
laugh,--"How can I but ken my ain wife's (haly be her rest!)--my ain
wife's first gudeman's sister, Bessie Maclure?An honest wife she is, but
sair she's been trysted wi' misfortunes,--the loss o' twa decent lads o'
sons, in the time o' the persecution, as they ca' it nowadays; and
doucely and decently she has borne her burden, blaming nane and
condemning nane.If there's an honest woman in the world, it's Bessie
Maclure.And to lose her twa sons, as I was saying, and to hae dragoons
clinked down on her for a month bypast,--for, be Whig or Tory uppermost,
they aye quarter thae loons on victuallers,--to lose, as I was saying--"

"This woman keeps an inn, then?""A public, in a puir way," replied Blane, looking round at his own
superior accommodations,--"a sour browst o' sma' ale that she sells to
folk that are over drouthy wi' travel to be nice; but naething to ca' a
stirring trade or a thriving changehouse.""Your honour will rest here a' the night?Ye'll hardly get accommodation
at Bessie's," said Niel, whose regard for his deceased wife's relative by
no means extended to sending company from his own house to hers."There is a friend," answered Morton, "whom I am to meet with there, and
I only called here to take a stirrup-cup and inquire the way.""Your honour had better," answerd the landlord, with the perseverance of
his calling, "send some ane to warn your friend to come on here.""I tell you, landlord," answered Morton, impatiently, "that will not
serve my purpose; I must go straight to this woman Maclure's house, and
I desire you to find me a guide.""Aweel, sir, ye'll choose for yoursell, to be sure," said Niel Blane,
somewhat disconcerted; "but deil a guide ye'll need if ye gae doun the
water for twa mile or sae, as gin ye were bound for Milnwoodhouse, and
then tak the first broken disjasked-looking road that makes for the
hills,--ye'll ken 't by a broken ash-tree that stands at the side o' a
burn just where the roads meet; and then travel out the path,--ye canna
miss Widow Maclure's public, for deil another house or hauld is on the
road for ten lang Scots miles, and that's worth twenty English.I am
sorry your honour would think o' gaun out o' my house the night.But my
wife's gude-sister is a decent woman, and it's no lost that a friend
gets."Morton accordingly paid his reckoning and departed.The sunset of the
summer day placed him at the ash-tree, where the path led up towards the
moors."Here," he said to himself, "my misfortunes commenced; for just here,
when Burley and I were about to separate on the first night we ever met,
he was alarmed by the intelligence that the passes were secured by
soldiers lying in wait for him.Beneath that very ash sate the old woman
who apprised him of his danger.How strange that my whole fortunes should
have become inseparably interwoven with that man's, without anything more
on my part than the discharge of an ordinary duty of humanity!Would to
Heaven it were possible I could find my humble quiet and tranquillity of
mind upon the spot where I lost them!"Thus arranging his reflections betwixt speech and thought, he turned his
horse's head up the path.Evening lowered around him as he advanced up the narrow dell which had
once been a wood, but was now a ravine divested of trees, unless where a
few, from their inaccessible situation on the edge of precipitous banks,
or clinging among rocks and huge stones, defied the invasion of men and
of cattle, like the scattered tribes of a conquered country, driven to
take refuge in the barren strength of its mountains.These too, wasted
and decayed, seemed rather to exist than to flourish, and only served to
indicate what the landscape had once been.But the stream brawled down
among them in all its freshness and vivacity, giving the life and
animation which a mountain rivulet alone can confer on the barest and
most savage scenes, and which the inhabitants of such a country miss when
gazing even upon the tranquil winding of a majestic stream through plains
of fertility, and beside palaces of splendour.The track of the road
followed the course of the brook, which was now visible, and now only to
be distinguished by its brawling heard among the stones or in the clefts
of the rock that occasionally interrupted its course."Murmurer that thou art," said Morton, in the enthusiasm of his reverie,
"why chafe with the rocks that stop thy course for a moment?There is a
sea to receive thee in its bosom; and there is an eternity for man when
his fretful and hasty course through the vale of time shall be ceased and
over.What thy petty fuming is to the deep and vast billows of a
shoreless ocean, are our cares, hopes, fears, joys, and sorrows to the
objects which must occupy us through the awful and boundless succession
of ages!"Thus moralizing, our traveller passed on till the dell opened, and the
banks, receding from the brook, left a little green vale, exhibiting a
croft, or small field, on which some corn was growing, and a cottage,
whose walls were not above five feet high, and whose thatched roof, green
with moisture, age, houseleek, and grass, had in some places suffered
damage from the encroachment of two cows, whose appetite this appearance
of verdure had diverted from their more legitimate pasture.An ill-spelt
and worse-written inscription intimated to the traveller that he might
here find refreshment for man and horse,--no unacceptable intimation,
rude as the hut appeared to be, considering the wild path he had trod in
approaching it, and the high and waste mountains which rose in desolate
dignity behind this humble asylum.It must indeed have been, thought Morton, in some such spot as this that
Burley was likely to find a congenial confident.As he approached, he observed the good dame of the house herself, seated
by the door; she had hitherto been concealed from him by a huge
alder-bush."Good evening, Mother," said the traveller."Your name is Mistress
Maclure?""Elizabeth Maclure, sir, a poor widow," was the reply."Can you lodge a stranger for a night?""I can, sir, if he will be pleased with the widow's cake and the widow's
cruse.""I have been a soldier, good dame," answered Morton, "and nothing can
come amiss to me in the way of entertainment."said the old woman, with a sigh,--"God send ye a better
trade!""It is believed to be an honourable profession, my good dame; I hope you
do not think the worse of me for having belonged to it?""I judge no one, sir," replied the woman, "and your voice sounds like
that of a civil gentleman; but I hae witnessed sae muckle ill wi'
sodgering in this puir land that I am e'en content that I can see nae
mair o't wi' these sightless organs."As she spoke thus, Morton observed that she was blind."Shall I not be troublesome to you, my good dame?"said he,
compassionately; "your infirmity seems ill calculated for your
profession.""Na, sir," answered the old woman, "I can gang about the house readily
eneugh; and I hae a bit lassie to help me, and the dragoon lads will look
after your horse when they come hame frae their patrol, for a sma'
matter; they are civiller now than lang syne.""Peggy, my bonny bird," continued the hostess, addressing a little girl
of twelve years old, who had by this time appeared, "tak the gentleman's
horse to the stable, and slack his girths, and tak aff the bridle, and
shake down a lock o' hay before him, till the dragoons come back.--Come
this way, sir," she continued; "ye'll find my house clean, though it's a
puir ane."Morton followed her into the cottage accordingly.Then out and spake the auld mother,
               And fast her tears did fa
               "Ye wadna be warn'd, my son Johnie,
               Frae the hunting to bide awa!"When he entered the cottage, Morton perceived that the old hostess had
spoken truth.The inside of the hut belied its outward appearance, and
was neat, and even comfortable, especially the inner apartment, in which
the hostess informed her guest that he was to sup and sleep.Refreshments
were placed before him such as the little inn afforded; and though he had
small occasion for them, he accepted the offer, as the means of
maintaining some discourse with the landlady.Notwithstanding her
blindness, she was assiduous in her attendance, and seemed, by a sort of
instinct, to find her way to what she wanted."Have you no one but this pretty little girl to assist you in waiting on
your guests?""None, sir," replied his old hostess; "I dwell alone, like the widow of
Zarephath.Few guests come to this puir place, and I haena custom eneugh
to hire servants.I had anes twa fine sons that lookit after a' thing.--But God gives and takes away,--His name be praised!"she continued,
turning her clouded eyes towards Heaven.--"I was anes better off, that
is, waridly speaking, even since I lost them; but that was before this
last change."said Morton; "and yet you are a Presbyterian, my good mother?""I am, sir; praised be the light that showed me the right way," replied
the landlady."Then I should have thought," continued the guest, "the Revolution would
have brought you nothing but good.""If," said the old woman, "it has brought the land gude, and freedom of
worship to tender consciences, it's little matter what it has brought to
a puir blind worm like me.""Still," replied Morton, "I cannot see how it could possibly injure you.""It's a lang story, sir," answered his hostess, with a sigh."But ae
night, sax weeks or thereby afore Bothwell Brigg, a young gentleman
stopped at this puir cottage, stiff and bloody with wounds, pale and dune
out wi' riding, and his horse sae weary he couldna drag ae foot after the
other, and his foes were close ahint him, and he was ane o' our enemies.You that's a sodger will think me but a silly auld
wife; but I fed him, and relieved him, and keepit him hidden till the
pursuit was ower.""And who," said Morton, "dares disapprove of your having done so?""I kenna," answered the blind woman; "I gat ill-will about it amang some
o' our ain folk.They said I should hae been to him what Jael was to
Sisera.But weel I wot I had nae divine command to shed blood, and to
save it was baith like a woman and a Christian.And then they said I
wanted natural affection, to relieve ane that belanged to the band that
murdered my twa sons.""Ay, sir; though maybe ye'll gie their deaths another name.The tane fell
wi' sword in hand, fighting for a broken national Covenant; the
tother,--oh, they took him and shot him dead on the green before his
mother's face!My auld een dazzled when the shots were looten off, and,
to my thought, they waxed weaker and weaker ever since that weary day;
and sorrow, and heart-break, and tears that would not be dried, might
help on the disorder.betraying Lord Evandale's young blood
to his enemies' sword wad ne'er hae brought my Ninian and Johnie alive
again.""Was it Lord Evandale whose
life you saved?""In troth, even his," she replied."And kind he was to me after, and gae
me a cow and calf, malt, meal, and siller, and nane durst steer me when
he was in power.But we live on an outside bit of Tillietudlem land, and
the estate was sair plea'd between Leddy Margaret Bellenden and the
present laird, Basil Olifant, and Lord Evandale backed the auld leddy for
love o' her daughter Miss Edith, as the country said, ane o' the best and
bonniest lassies in Scotland.But they behuved to gie way, and Basil gat
the Castle and land, and on the back o' that came the Revolution, and wha
to turn coat faster than the laird?for he said he had been a true Whig
a' the time, and turned <DW7> only for fashion's sake.And then he got
favour, and Lord Evandale's head was under water; for he was ower proud
and manfu' to bend to every blast o' wind, though mony a ane may ken as
weel as me that be his ain principles as they might, he was nae ill
friend to our folk when he could protect us, and far kinder than Basil
Olifant, that aye keepit the cobble head doun the stream.But he was set
by and ill looked on, and his word ne'er asked; and then Basil, wha's a
revengefu' man, set himsell to vex him in a' shapes, and especially by
oppressing and despoiling the auld blind widow, Bessie Maclure, that
saved Lord Evandale's life, and that he was sae kind to.But he's mistaen
if that's his end; for it will be lang or Lord Evandale hears a word frae
me about the selling my kye for rent or e'er it was due, or the putting
the dragoons on me when the country's quiet, or onything else that will
vex him,--I can bear my ain burden patiently, and warld's loss is the
least part o't."Astonished and interested at this picture of patient, grateful, and
high-minded resignation, Morton could not help bestowing an execration
upon the poor-spirited rascal who had taken such a dastardly course of
vengeance."Dinna curse him, sir," said the old woman; "I have heard a good man say
that a curse was like a stone flung up to the heavens, and maist like to
return on the head that sent it.But if ye ken Lord Evandale, bid him
look to himsell, for I hear strange words pass atween the sodgers that
are lying here, and his name is often mentioned; and the tane o' them has
been twice up at Tillietudlem.He's a kind of favourite wi' the laird,
though he was in former times ane o' the maist cruel oppressors ever rade
through a country (out-taken Sergeant Bothwell),--they ca' him Inglis.""I have the deepest interest in Lord Evandale's safety," said Morton,
"and you may depend on my finding some mode to apprise him of these
suspicious circumstances.And, in return, my good friend, will you
indulge me with another question?Do you know anything of Quintin Mackell
of Irongray?"echoed the blind woman, in a tone of great surprise and
alarm."Quintin Mackell of Irongray," repeated Morton."Is there anything so
alarming in the sound of that name?""Na, na," answered the woman, with hesitation; "but to hear him asked
after by a stranger and a sodger,--Gude protect us, what mischief is
to come next!""None by my means, I assure you," said Morton; "the subject of my inquiry
has nothing to fear from me if, as I suppose, this Quintin Mackell is the
same with John Bal-----.""Do not mention his name," said the widow, pressing his lips with her
fingers."I see you have his secret and his pass-word, and I'll be free
wi' you.But, for God's sake, speak lound and low.In the name of Heaven,
I trust ye seek him not to his hurt!"I said truly; but one he has nothing to fear from.I commanded a party
at Bothwell Bridge.""And verily there is something in your voice I
can trust.Ye speak prompt and readily, and like an honest man.""I trust I am so," said Morton."But nae displeasure to you, sir, in thae waefu' times," continued Mrs.Maclure, "the hand of brother is against brother, and he fears as mickle
almaist frae this Government as e'er he did frae the auld persecutors."said Morton, in a tone of inquiry; "I was not aware of that.But
I am only just now returned from abroad.""I'll tell ye," said the blind woman, first assuming an attitude of
listening that showed how effectually her powers of collecting
intelligence had been transferred from the eye to the ear; for, instead
of casting a glance of circumspection around, she stooped her face, and
turned her head slowly around, in such a manner as to insure that there
was not the slightest sound stirring in the neighbourhood, and then
continued,--"I'll tell ye.Ye ken how he has laboured to raise up again
the Covenant, burned, broken, and buried in the hard hearts and selfish
devices of this stubborn people.Now, when he went to Holland, far from
the countenance and thanks of the great, and the comfortable fellowship
of the godly, both whilk he was in right to expect, the Prince of Orange
wad show him no favour, and the ministers no godly communion.This was
hard to bide for ane that had suffered and done mickle,--ower mickle, it
may be; but why suld I be a judge?He came back to me and to the auld
place o' refuge that had often received him in his distresses, mair
especially before the great day of victory at Drumclog, for I sail ne'er
forget how he was bending hither of a' nights in the year on that e'ening
after the play when young Milnwood wan the popinjay; but I warned him off
for that time."exclaimed Morton, "it was you that sat in your red cloak by the
high-road, and told him there was a lion in the path?"said the old woman, breaking off her
narrative in astonishment."But be wha ye may," she continued, resuming
it with tranquillity, "ye can ken naething waur o' me than that I hae
been willing to save the life o' friend and foe.""I know no ill of you, Mrs.Maclure, and I mean no ill by you; I only
wished to show you that I know so much of this person's affairs that I
might be safely intrusted with the rest.Proceed, if you please, in your
narrative.""There is a strange command in your voice," said the blind woman, "though
its tones are sweet.The Stewarts hae been
dethroned, and William and Mary reign in their stead; but nae mair word
of the Covenant than if it were a dead letter.They hae taen the indulged
clergy, and an Erastian General Assembly of the ante pure and triumphant
Kirk of Scotland, even into their very arms and bosoms.Our faithfu'
champions o' the testimony agree e'en waur wi' this than wi' the open
tyranny and apostasy of the persecuting times, for souls are hardened and
deadened, and the mouths of fasting multitudes are crammed wi' fizenless
bran instead of the sweet word in season; and mony an hungry, starving
creature, when he sits down on a Sunday forenoon to get something that
might warm him to the great work, has a dry clatter o' morality driven
about his lugs, and--"

"In short," said Morton, desirous to stop a discussion which the good old
woman, as enthusiastically attached to her religious profession as to the
duties of humanity, might probably have indulged longer,--"In short, you
are not disposed to acquiesce in this new government, and Burley is of
the same opinion?""Many of our brethren, sir, are of belief we fought for the Covenant, and
fasted and prayed and suffered for that grand national league, and now we
are like neither to see nor hear tell of that which we suffered and
fought and fasted and prayed for.And anes it was thought something might
be made by bringing back the auld family on a new bargain and a new
bottom, as, after a', when King James went awa, I understand the great
quarrel of the English against him was in behalf of seven unhallowed
prelates; and sae, though ae part of our people were free to join wi' the
present model, and levied an armed regiment under the Yerl of Angus, yet
our honest friend, and others that stude up for purity of doctrine and
freedom of conscience, were determined to hear the breath o' the
Jacobites before they took part again them, fearing to fa' to the ground
like a wall built with unslaked mortar, or from sitting between twa
stools.""They chose an odd quarter," said Morton, "from which to expect freedom
of conscience and purity of doctrine."said the landlady, "the natural day-spring rises in the
east, but the spiritual dayspring may rise in the north, for what we
blinded mortals ken.""And Burley went to the north to seek it?""Truly ay, sir; and he saw Claver'se himsell, that they ca' Dundee now."exclaimed Morton, in amazement; "I would have sworn that meeting
would have been the last of one of their lives.""Na, na, sir; in troubled times, as I understand," said Mrs.Maclure,
"there's sudden changes,--Montgomery and Ferguson and mony ane mair that
were King James's greatest faes are on his side now.Claver'se spake our
friend fair, and sent him to consult with Lord Evandale.But then there
was a break-off, for Lord Evandale wadna look at, hear, or speak wi' him;
and now he's anes wud and aye waur, and roars for revenge again Lord
Evandale, and will hear nought of onything but burn and slay.And oh,
thae starts o' passion!they unsettle his mind, and gie the Enemy sair
advantages."Are ye acquainted familiarly wi' John Balfour o' Burley, and
dinna ken that he has had sair and frequent combats to sustain against
the Evil One?Did ye ever see him alone but the Bible was in his hand,
and the drawn sword on his knee?Did ye never sleep in the same room wi'
him, and hear him strive in his dreams with the delusions of Satan?Oh,
ye ken little o' him if ye have seen him only in fair daylight; for nae
man can put the face upon his doleful visits and strifes that he can do.I hae seen him, after sic a strife of agony, tremble that an infant might
hae held him, while the hair on his brow was drapping as fast as ever my
puir thatched roof did in a heavy rain."As she spoke, Morton began to
recollect the appearance of Burley during his sleep in the hay-loft at
Milnwood, the report of Cuddie that his senses had become impaired, and
some whispers current among the Cameronians, who boasted frequently of
Burley's soul-exercises and his strifes with the foul fiend,--which
several circumstances led him to conclude that this man himself was a
victim to those delusions, though his mind, naturally acute and forcible,
not only disguised his superstition from those in whose opinion it might
have discredited his judgment, but by exerting such a force as is said to
be proper to those afflicted with epilepsy, could postpone the fits which
it occasioned until he was either freed from superintendence, or
surrounded by such as held him more highly on account of these
visitations.It was natural to suppose, and could easily be inferred from
the narrative of Mrs.Maclure, that disappointed ambition, wrecked hopes,
and the downfall of the party which he had served with such desperate
fidelity, were likely to aggravate enthusiasm into temporary insanity.It
was, indeed, no uncommon circumstance in those singular times that men
like Sir Harry Vane, Harrison, Overton, and others, themselves slaves to
the wildest and most enthusiastic dreams, could, when mingling with the
world, conduct themselves not only with good sense in difficulties, and
courage in dangers, but with the most acute sagacity and determined
valour.Maclure's information confirmed
Morton in these impressions."In the grey of the morning," she said, "my little Peggy sail show ye the
gate to him before the sodgers are up.But ye maun let his hour of
danger, as he ca's it, be ower, afore ye venture on him in his place of
refuge.Peggy will tell ye when to venture in.She kens his ways weel,
for whiles she carries him some little helps that he canna do
without to sustain life.""And in what retreat, then," said Morton, "has this unfortunate person
found refuge?""An awsome place," answered the blind woman, "as ever living creature
took refuge in; they ca it the Black Linn of Linklater.It's a doleful
place, but he loves it abune a' others, because he has sae often been in
safe hiding there; and it's my belief he prefers it to a tapestried
chamber and a down bed.I hae seen it mysell mony a day
syne.I was a daft hempie lassie then, and little thought what was to
come o't.--Wad ye choose ony thing, sir, ere ye betake yoursell to your
rest, for ye maun stir wi' the first dawn o' the grey light?""Nothing more, my good mother," said Morton; and they parted for the
evening.Morton recommended himself to Heaven, threw himself on the bed, heard,
between sleeping and waking, the trampling of the dragoon horses at the
riders' return from their patrol, and then slept soundly after such
painful agitation.The darksome cave they enter, where they found
               The accursed man low sitting on the ground,
               Musing full sadly in his sullen mind.As the morning began to appear on the mountains, a gentle knock was heard
at the door of the humble apartment in which Morton slept, and a girlish
treble voice asked him, from without, "If he wad please gang to the Linn
or the folk raise?"He arose upon the invitation, and, dressing himself hastily, went forth
and joined his little guide.The mountain maid tript lightly before him,
through the grey haze, over hill and moor.It was a wild and varied walk,
unmarked by any regular or distinguishable track, and keeping, upon the
whole, the direction of the ascent of the brook, though without tracing
its windings.The landscape, as they advanced, became waster and more
wild, until nothing but heath and rock encumbered the side of the valley."Nearly a mile off," answered
the girl."And do you often go this wild journey, my little maid?""When grannie sends me wi' milk and meal to the Linn," answered the
child."And are you not afraid to travel so wild a road alone?""Hout na, sir," replied the guide; "nae living creature wad touch sic a
bit thing as I am, and grannie says we need never fear onything else when
we are doing a gude turn."said Morton to himself, and
followed her steps in silence.They soon came to a decayed thicket, where brambles and thorns supplied
the room of the oak and birches of which it had once consisted.Here the
guide turned short off the open heath, and, by a sheep-track, conducted
Morton to the brook.A hoarse and sullen roar had in part prepared him
for the scene which presented itself, yet it was not to be viewed without
surprise and even terror.When he emerged from the devious path which
conducted him through the thicket, he found himself placed on a ledge of
flat rock projecting over one side of a chasm not less than a hundred
feet deep, where the dark mountain-stream made a decided and rapid shoot
over the precipice, and was swallowed up by a deep, black, yawning gulf.The eye in vain strove to see the bottom of the fall; it could catch but
one sheet of foaming uproar and sheer descent, until the view was
obstructed by the proecting crags which enclosed the bottom of the
waterfall, and hid from sight the dark pool which received its tortured
waters; far beneath, at the distance of perhaps a quarter of a mile, the
eye caught the winding of the stream as it emerged into a more open
course.But, for that distance, they were lost to sight as much as if a
cavern had been arched over them; and indeed the steep and projecting
ledges of rock through which they wound their way in darkness were very
nearly closing and over-roofing their course.While Morton gazed at this scene of tumult, which seemed, by the
surrounding thickets and the clefts into which the waters descended, to
seek to hide itself from every eye, his little attendant as she stood
beside him on the platform of rock which commanded the best view of the
fall, pulled him by the sleeve, and said, in a tone which he could not
hear without stooping his ear near the speaker, "Hear till him!Morton listened more attentively; and out of the very abyss into which
the brook fell, and amidst the turnultuary sounds of the cataract,
thought he could distinguish shouts, screams, and even articulate words,
as if the tortured demon of the stream had been mingling his complaints
with the roar of his broken waters."This is the way," said the little girl; "follow me, gin ye please, sir,
but tak tent to your feet;" and, with the daring agility which custom had
rendered easy, she vanished from the platform on which she stood, and, by
notches and slight projections in the rock, scrambled down its face into
the chasm which it overhung.Steady, bold, and active, Morton hesitated
not to follow her; but the necessary attention to secure his hold and
footing in a descent where both foot and hand were needful for security,
prevented him from looking around him, till, having descended nigh twenty
feet, and being sixty or seventy above the pool which received the fall,
his guide made a pause, and he again found himself by her side in a
situation that appeared equally romantic and precarious.They were nearly
opposite to the waterfall, and in point of level situated at about
one-quarter's depth from the point of the cliff over which it thundered,
and three-fourths of the height above the dark, deep, and restless pool
which received its fall.Both these tremendous points--the first shoot,
namely, of the yet unbroken stream, and the deep and sombre abyss into
which it was emptied--were full before him, as well as the whole
continuous stream of billowy froth, which, dashing from the one, was
eddying and boiling in the other.They were so near this grand phenomenon
that they were covered with its spray, and well-nigh deafened by the
incessant roar.But crossing in the very front of the fall, and at scarce
three yards distance from the cataract, an old oak-tree, flung across the
chasm in a manner that seemed accidental, formed a bridge of fearfully
narrow dimensions and uncertain footing.The upper end of the tree rested
on the platform on which they stood; the lower or uprooted extremity
extended behind a projection on the opposite side, and was secured,
Morton's eye could not discover where.From behind the same projection
glimmered a strong red light, which, glancing in the waves of the falling
water, and tinging them partially with crimson, had a strange
preternatural and sinister effect when contrasted with the beams of the
rising sun, which glanced on the first broken waves of the fall, though
even its meridian splendour could not gain the third of its full depth.When he had looked around him for a moment, the girl again pulled his
sleeve, and, pointing to the oak and the projecting point beyond it (for
hearing speech was now out of the question), indicated that there lay his
farther passage.Morton gazed at her with surprise; for although he well knew that the
persecuted Presbyterians had in the preceding reigns sought refuge among
dells and thickets, caves and cataracts, in spots the most extraordinary
and secluded; although he had heard of the champions of the Covenant, who
had long abidden beside Dobs-lien on the wild heights of Polmoodie, and
others who had been concealed in the yet more terrific cavern called
Creehope-linn, in the parish of Closeburn,--yet his imagination had never
exactly figured out the horrors of such a residence, and he was surprised
how the strange and romantic scene which he now saw had remained
concealed from him, while a curious investigator of such natural
phenomena.But he readily conceived that, lying in a remote and wild
district, and being destined as a place of concealment to the persecuted
preachers and professors of nonconformity, the secret of its existence
was carefully preserved by the few shepherds to whom it might be known.As, breaking from these meditations, he began to consider how he should
traverse the doubtful and terrific bridge, which, skirted by the cascade,
and rendered wet and slippery by its constant drizzle, traversed the
chasm above sixty feet from the bottom of the fall, his guide, as if to
give him courage, tript over and back without the least hesitation.Envying for a moment the little bare feet which caught a safer hold of
the rugged side of the oak than he could pretend to with his heavy boots,
Morton nevertheless resolved to attempt the passage, and, fixing his eye
firm on a stationary object on the other side, without allowing his head
to become giddy, or his attention to be distracted by the flash, the
foam, and the roar of the waters around him, he strode steadily and
safely along the uncertain bridge, and reached the mouth of a small
cavern on the farther side of the torrent.Here he paused; for a light,
proceeding from a fire of red-hot charcoal, permitted him to see the
interior of the cave, and enabled him to contemplate the appearance of
its inhabitant, by whom he himself could not be so readily distinguished,
being concealed by the shadow of the rock.What he observed would by no
means have encouraged a less determined man to proceed with the task
which he had undertaken.Burley, only altered from what he had been formerly by the addition of a
grisly beard, stood in the midst of the cave, with his clasped Bible in
one hand, and his drawn sword in the other.His figure, dimly ruddied by
the light of the red charcoal, seemed that of a fiend in the lurid
atmosphere of Pandemonium, and his gestures and words, as far as they
could be heard, seemed equally violent and irregular.All alone, and in a
place of almost unapproachable seclusion, his demeanour was that of
a man who strives for life and death with a mortal enemy.he exclaimed, accompanying each word with a thrust,
urged with his whole force against the impassible and empty air, "Did I
not tell thee so?--I have resisted, and thou fleest from me!--Coward as
thou art, come in all thy terrors; come with mine own evil deeds, which
render thee most terrible of all,--there is enough betwixt the boards of
this book to rescue me!--What mutterest thou of grey hairs?It was well
done to slay him,--the more ripe the corn, the readier for the sickle.--
Art gone?Art gone?--I have ever known thee but a coward--ha!With these wild exclamations he sunk the point of his sword, and remained
standing still in the same posture, like a maniac whose fit is over."The dangerous time is by now," said the little girl who had followed;
"it seldom lasts beyond the time that the sun's ower the hill; ye may
gang in and speak wi' him now.I'll wait for you at the other side of the
linn; he canna bide to see twa folk at anes."Slowly and cautiously, and keeping constantly upon his guard, Morton
presented himself to the view of his old associate in command.comest thou again when thine hour is over?"was his first
exclamation; and flourishing his sword aloft, his countenance assumed an
expression in which ghastly terror seemed mingled with the rage of a
demoniac.Balfour," said Morton, in a steady and composed tone,
"to renew an acquaintance which has been broken off since the fight of
Bothwell Bridge."As soon as Burley became aware that Morton was before him in person,--an
idea which he caught with marvellous celerity,--he at once exerted that
mastership over his heated and enthusiastic imagination, the power of
enforcing which was a most striking part of his extraordinary character.He sunk his sword-point at once, and as he stole it composedly into the
scabbard, he muttered something of the damp and cold which sent an old
soldier to his fencing exercise, to prevent his blood from chilling.This
done, he proceeded in the cold, determined manner which was peculiar to
his ordinary discourse:--

"Thou hast tarried long, Henry Morton, and hast not come to the vintage
before the twelfth hour has struck.Art thou yet willing to take the
right hand of fellowship, and be one with those who look not to thrones
or dynasties, but to the rule of Scripture, for their directions?"[Illustration: Morton and Black Linn--272]


"I am surprised," said Morton, evading the direct answer to his question,
"that you should have known me after so many years.""The features of those who ought to act with me are engraved on my
heart," answered Burley; "and few but Silas Morton's son durst have
followed me into this my castle of retreat.Seest thou that drawbridge of
Nature's own construction?"he added, pointing to the prostrate
oak-tree,--"one spurn of my foot, and it is overwhelmed in the abyss
below, bidding foeman on the farther side stand at defiance, and leaving
enemies on this at the mercy of one who never yet met his equal in single
fight.""Of such defences," said Morton, "I should have thought you would now
have had little need.""What little need, when incarnate
fiends are combined against me on earth, and Sathan himself--But it
matters not," added he, checking himself."Enough that I like my place
of refuge, my cave of Adullam, and would not change its rude ribs of
limestone rock for the fair chambers of the castle of the earls of
Torwood, with their broad bounds and barony.Thou, unless the foolish
fever-fit be over, mayst think differently.""It was of those very possessions I came to speak," said Morton; "and I
doubt not to find Mr.Balfour the same rational and reflecting person
which I knew him to be in times when zeal disunited brethren.""In a word, then," said Morton, "you have exercised, by means at which I
can guess, a secret, but most prejudicial, influence over the fortunes of
Lady Margaret Bellenden and her granddaughter, and in favour of that
base, oppressive apostate, Basil Olifant, whom the law, deceived by thy
operations, has placed in possession of their lawful property.""I do say so," replied Morton; "and face to face you will not deny what
you have vouched by your handwriting.""And suppose I deny it not," said Balfour; "and suppose that
thy--eloquence were found equal to persuade me to retrace the steps I
have taken on matured resolve,--what will be thy meed?Dost thou still
hope to possess the fair-haired girl, with her wide and rich
inheritance?""I have no such hope," answered Morton, calmly."And for whom, then, hast thou ventured to do this great thing,--to seek
to rend the prey from the valiant, to bring forth food from the den of
the lion, and to extract sweetness from the maw of the devourer?For
whose sake hast thou undertaken to read this riddle, more hard than
Samson's?""For Lord Evandale's and that of his bride," replied Morton, firmly.Balfour, and believe there are some who are
willing to sacrifice their happiness to that of others.""Then, as my soul liveth," replied Balfour, "thou art, to wear beard and
back a horse and draw a sword, the tamest and most gall-less puppet that
ever sustained injury unavenged.thou wouldst help that accursed
Evandale to the arms of the woman that thou lovest; thou wouldst endow
them with wealth and with heritages, and thou think'st that there lives
another man, offended even more deeply than thou, yet equally
cold-livered and mean-spirited, crawling upon the face of the earth,
and hast dared to suppose that one other to be John Balfour?""For my own feelings," said Morton, composedly, "I am answerable to none
but Heaven; to you, Mr.Balfour, I should suppose it of little
consequence whether Basil Olifant or Lord Evandale possess these
estates.""Thou art deceived," said Burley; "both are indeed in outer darkness,
and strangers to the light, as he whose eyes have never been opened to
the day.But this Basil Olifant is a Nabal, a Demas, a base churl whose
wealth and power are at the disposal of him who can threaten to deprive
him of them.He became a professor because he was deprived of these lands
of Tillietudlem; he turned a <DW7> to obtain possession of them; he
called himself an Erastian, that he might not again lose them; and he
will become what I list while I have in my power the document that may
deprive him of them.These lands are a bit between his jaws and a hook in
his nostrils, and the rein and the line are in my hands to guide them as
I think meet; and his they shall therefore be, unless I had assurance of
bestowing them on a sure and sincere friend.But Lord Evandale is a
malignant, of heart like flint, and brow like adamant; the goods of the
world fall on him like leaves on the frost-bound earth, and unmoved he
will see them whirled off by the first wind.The heathen virtues of such
as he are more dangerous to us than the sordid cupidity of those who,
governed by their interest, must follow where it leads, and who,
therefore, themselves the slaves of avarice, may be compelled to work
in the vineyard, were it but to earn the wages of sin.""This might have been all well some years since," replied Morton, "and I
could understand your argument, although I could never acquiesce in its
justice.But at this crisis it seems useless to you to persevere in
keeping up an influence which can no longer be directed to an useful
purpose.The land has peace, liberty, and freedom of conscience,--and
what would you more?"exclaimed Burley, again unsheathing his sword, with a vivacity
which nearly made Morton start."Look at the notches upon that weapon
they are three in number, are they not?""It seems so," answered Morton; "but what of that?""The fragment of steel that parted from this first gap rested on the
skull of the perjured traitor who first introduced Episcopacy into
Scotland; this second notch was made in the rib-bone of an impious
villain, the boldest and best soldier that upheld the prelatic cause at
Drumclog; this third was broken on the steel head-piece of the captain
who defended the Chapel of Holyrood when the people rose at the
Revolution.I cleft him to the teeth, through steel and bone.It has done
great deeds, this little weapon, and each of these blows was a
deliverance to the Church.This sword," he said, again sheathing it,
"has yet more to do,--to weed out this base and pestilential heresy of
Erastianism; to vindicate the true liberty of the Kirk in her purity;
to restore the Covenant in its glory,--then let it moulder and rust
beside the bones of its master.""You have neither men nor means, Mr.Balfour, to disturb the Government
as now settled," argued Morton; "the people are in general satisfied,
excepting only the gentlemen of the Jacobite interest; and surely you
would not join with those who would only use you for their own purposes?""It is they," answered Burley, "that should serve ours.I went to the
camp of the malignant Claver'se, as the future King of Israel sought the
land of the Philistines; I arranged with him a rising; and but for the
villain Evandale, the Erastians ere now had been driven from the West.--
I could slay him," he added, with a vindictive scowl, "were he grasping
the horns of the altar!"He then proceeded in a calmer tone: "If thou,
son of mine ancient comrade, were suitor for thyself to this Edith
Bellenden, and wert willing to put thy hand to the great work with zeal
equal to thy courage, think not I would prefer the friendship of Basil
Olifant to thine; thou shouldst then have the means that this document
[he produced a parchment] affords to place her in possession of the lands
of her fathers.This have I longed to say to thee ever since I saw thee
fight the good fight so strongly at the fatal Bridge.The maiden loved
thee, and thou her."Morton replied firmly, "I will not dissemble with you, Mr.Balfour, even
to gain a good end.I came in hopes to persuade you to do a deed of
justice to others, not to gain any selfish end of my own.I have failed;
I grieve for your sake more than for the loss which others will sustain
by your injustice.""Would you be really, as you are desirous to be
thought, a man of honour and conscience, you would, regardless of all
other considerations, restore that parchment to Lord Evandale, to be used
for the advantage of the lawful heir."said Balfour; and, casting the deed into the
heap of red charcoal beside him, pressed it down with the heel of his
boot.While it smoked, shrivelled, and crackled in the flames, Morton sprung
forward to snatch it, and Burley catching hold of him, a struggle ensued.Both were strong men; but although Morton was much the more active and
younger of the two, yet Balfour was the most powerful, and effectually
prevented him from rescuing the deed until it was fairly reduced to a
cinder.They then quitted hold of each other, and the enthusiast,
rendered fiercer by the contest, glared on Morton with an eye expressive
of frantic revenge."Thou hast my secret," he exclaimed; "thou must be mine, or die!""I contemn your threats," said Morton; "I pity you, and leave you."But as he turned to retire, Burley stept before him, pushed the oak-trunk
from its resting place, and as it fell thundering and crashing into the
abyss beneath, drew his sword, and cried out, with a voice that rivalled
the roar of the cataract and the thunder of the falling oak, "Now thou
art at bay!and standing in the mouth of the
cavern, he flourished his naked sword."I will not fight with the man that preserved my father's life," said
Morton."I have not yet learned to say the words, 'I yield;' and my life
I will rescue as I best can."So speaking, and ere Balfour was aware of his purpose, he sprung past
him, and exerting that youthful agility of which he possessed an uncommon
share, leaped clear across the fearful chasm which divided the mouth of
the cave from the projecting rock on the opposite side, and stood there
safe and free from his incensed enemy.He immediately ascended the
ravine, and, as he turned, saw Burley stand for an instant aghast with
astonishment, and then, with the frenzy of disappointed rage, rush into
the interior of his cavern.It was not difficult for him to perceive that this unhappy man's mind had
been so long agitated by desperate schemes and sudden disappointments
that it had lost its equipoise, and that there was now in his conduct a
shade of lunacy, not the less striking, from the vigour and craft with
which he pursued his wild designs.Morton soon joined his guide, who had
been terrified by the fall of the oak.This he represented as accidental;
and she assured him, in return, that the inhabitant of the cave would
experience no inconvenience from it, being always provided with materials
to construct another bridge.The adventures of the morning were not yet ended.As they approached the
hut, the little girl made an exclamation of surprise at seeing her
grandmother groping her way towards them, at a greater distance from her
home than she could have been supposed capable of travelling.said the old woman, when she heard them approach, "gin
e'er ye loved Lord Evandale, help now, or never!God be praised that left
my hearing when he took my poor eyesight!Peggy, hinny, gang saddle the gentleman's horse, and
lead him cannily ahint the thorny shaw, and bide him there."She conducted him to a small window, through which, himself unobserved,
he could see two dragoons seated at their morning draught of ale, and
conversing earnestly together."The more I think of it," said the one, "the less I like it, Inglis;
Evandale was a good officer and the soldier's friend; and though we were
punished for the mutiny at Tillietudlem, yet, by ---, Frank, you must own
we deserved it.""D--n seize me if I forgive him for it, though!"replied the other; "and
I think I can sit in his skirts now.""Why, man, you should forget and forgive.Better take the start with him
along with the rest, and join the ranting Highlanders.We have all eat
King James's bread.""Thou art an ass; the start, as you call it, will never happen,--the
day's put off.Halliday's seen a ghost, or Miss Bellenden's fallen sick
of the pip, or some blasted nonsense or another; the thing will never
keep two days longer, and the first bird that sings out will get the
reward.""That's true too," answered his comrade; "and will this fellow--this
Basil Olifant--pay handsomely?""Like a prince, man," said Inglis."Evandale is the man on earth whom he
hates worst, and he fears him, besides, about some law business; and were
he once rubbed out of the way, all, he thinks, will be his own.""But shall we have warrants and force enough?""Few people here will stir against my lord, and we may find him with some
of our own fellows at his back.""Thou 'rt a cowardly fool, Dick," returned Inglis; "he is living quietly
down at Fairy Knowe to avoid suspicion.Olifant is a magistrate, and will
have some of his own people that he can trust along with him.There are
us two, and the laird says he can get a desperate fighting Whig fellow,
called Quintin Mackell, that has an old grudge at Evandale.""Well, well, you are my officer, you know," said the private, with true
military conscience, "and if anything is wrong--"

"I'll take the blame," said Inglis."Come, another pot of ale, and let us
to Tillietudlem.--Here, blind Bess!--Why, where the devil has the old hag
crept to?""Delay them as long as you can," whispered Morton, as he thrust his purse
into the hostess's hand; "all depends on gaining time."Then, walking swiftly to the place where the girl held his horse ready,
"To Fairy Knowe?Wittenbold, the commandant there, will readily give me the
support of a troop, and procure me the countenance of the civil power.I
must drop a caution as I pass.--Come, Moorkopf," he said, addressing his
horse as he mounted him, "this day must try your breath and speed."Yet could he not his closing eyes withdraw,
          Though less and less of Emily he saw;
          So, speechless for a little space he lay,
          Then grasp'd the hand he held, and sigh'd his soul away.The indisposition of Edith confined her to bed during the eventful day on
which she had received such an unexpected shock from the sudden
apparition of Morton.Next morning, however, she was reported to be so
much better that Lord Evandale resumed his purpose of leaving Fairy
Knowe.At a late hour in the forenoon Lady Emily entered the apartment of
Edith with a peculiar gravity of manner.Having received and paid the
compliments of the day, she observed it would be a sad one for her,
though it would relieve Miss Bellenden of an encumbrance: "My brother
leaves us today, Miss Bellenden."exclaimed Edith, in surprise; "for his own house, I trust?""I have reason to think he meditates a more distant journey," answered
Lady Emily; "he has little to detain him in this country."exclaimed Edith, "why was I born to become the wreck of
all that is manly and noble!What can be done to stop him from running
headlong on ruin?I will come down instantly.--Say that I implore he will
not depart until I speak with him.""It will be in vain, Miss Bellenden; but I will execute your commission;"
and she left the room as formally as she had entered it, and informed her
brother Miss Bellenden was so much recovered as to propose coming
downstairs ere he went away."I suppose," she added pettishly, "the prospect of being speedily
released from our company has wrought a cure on her shattered nerves.""Sister," said Lord Evandale, "you are unjust, if not envious.""Unjust I maybe, Evandale, but I should not have dreamt," glancing her
eye at a mirror, "of being thought envious without better cause.But let
us go to the old lady; she is making a feast in the other room which
might have dined all your troop when you had one."Lord Evandale accompanied her in silence to the parlour, for he knew it
was in vain to contend with her prepossessions and offended pride.They
found the table covered with refreshments, arranged under the careful
inspection of Lady Margaret."Ye could hardly weel be said to breakfast this morning, my Lord
Evandale, and ye maun e'en partake of a small collation before ye ride,
such as this poor house, whose inmates are so much indebted to you, can
provide in their present circumstances.For my ain part, I like to see
young folk take some refection before they ride out upon their sports or
their affairs, and I said as much to his most sacred Majesty when he
breakfasted at Tillietudlem in the year of grace sixteen hundred and
fifty-one; and his most sacred Majesty was pleased to reply, drinking to
my health at the same time in a flagon of Rhenish wine, 'Lady Margaret,
ye speak like a Highland oracle.'These were his Majesty's very words;
so that your lordship may judge whether I have not good authority to
press young folk to partake of their vivers."It may be well supposed that much of the good lady's speech failed Lord
Evandale's ears, which were then employed in listening for the light step
of Edith.His absence of mind on this occasion, however natural, cost him
very dear.While Lady Margaret was playing the kind hostess,--a part she
delighted and excelled in,--she was interrupted by John Gudyill, who, in
the natural phrase for announcing an inferior to the mistress of a
family, said, "There was ane wanting to speak to her leddyship."Ye speak as if I kept a shop, and was to
come at everybody's whistle.""Yes, he has a name," answered John, "but your leddyship likes ill to
hear't.""It's Calf-Gibbie, my leddy," said John, in a tone rather above the pitch
of decorous respect, on which he occasionally trespassed, confiding in
his merit as an ancient servant of the family and a faithful follower of
their humble fortunes,--"It's Calf-Gibbie, an your leddyship will hae't,
that keeps Edie Henshaw's kye down yonder at the Brigg-end,--that's him
that was Guse-Gibbie at Tillietudlem, and gaed to the wappinshaw, and
that--"

"Hold your peace, John," said the old lady, rising in dignity; "you are
very insolent to think I wad speak wi' a person like that.Let him tell
his business to you or Mrs."He'll no hear o' that, my leddy; he says them that sent him bade him gie
the thing to your leddyship's ain hand direct, or to Lord Evandale's, he
wots na whilk.But, to say the truth, he's far frae fresh, and he's but
an idiot an he were.""Then turn him out," said Lady Margaret, "and tell him to come back
to-morrow when he is sober.I suppose he comes to crave some benevolence,
as an ancient follower o' the house.""Like eneugh, my leddy, for he's a' in rags, poor creature."Gudyill made another attempt to get at Gibbie's commission, which was
indeed of the last importance, being a few lines from Morton to Lord
Evandale, acquainting him with the danger in which he stood from the
practices of Olifant, and exhorting him either to instant flight, or else
to come to Glasgow and surrender himself, where he could assure him of
protection.This billet, hastily written, he intrusted to Gibbie, whom he
saw feeding his herd beside the bridge, and backed with a couple of
dollars his desire that it might instantly be delivered into the hand to
which it was addressed.But it was decreed that Goose-Gibbie's intermediation, whether as an
emissary or as a man-at-arms, should be unfortunate to the family of
Tillietudlem.He unluckily tarried so long at the ale-house to prove if
his employer's coin was good that, when he appeared at Fairy Knowe, the
little sense which nature had given him was effectually drowned in ale
and brandy; and instead of asking for Lord Evandale, he demanded to speak
with Lady Margaret, whose name was more familiar to his ear.Being
refused admittance to her presence, he staggered away with the letter
undelivered, perversely faithful to Morton's instructions in the only
point in which it would have been well had he departed from them.A few minutes after he was gone, Edith entered the apartment.Lord
Evandale and she met with mutual embarrassment, which Lady Margaret, who
only knew in general that their union had been postponed by her
granddaughter's indisposition, set down to the bashfulness of a bride and
bridegroom, and, to place them at ease, began to talk to Lady Emily on
indifferent topics.At this moment Edith, with a countenance as pale as
death, muttered, rather than whispered, to Lord Evandale a request to
speak with him.He offered his arm, and supported her into the small
ante-room, which, as we have noticed before, opened from the parlour.He
placed her in a chair, and, taking one himself, awaited the opening of
the conversation."I am distressed, my lord," were the first words she was able to
articulate, and those with difficulty; "I scarce know what I would say,
nor how to speak it.""If I have any share in occasioning your uneasiness," said Lord Evandale,
mildly, "you will soon, Edith, be released from it.""You are determined then, my lord," she replied, "to run this desperate
course with desperate men, in spite of your own better reason, in spite
of your friends' entreaties, in spite of the almost inevitable ruin which
yawns before you?""Forgive me, Miss Bellenden; even your solicitude on my account must not
detain me when my honour calls.My horses stand ready saddled, my
servants are prepared, the signal for rising will be given so soon as I
reach Kilsyth.If it is my fate that calls me, I will not shun meeting
it.It will be something," he said, taking her hand, "to die deserving
your compassion, since I cannot gain your love."said Edith, in a tone which went to his heart;
"time may explain the strange circumstance which has shocked me so much;
my agitated nerves may recover their tranquillity.Oh, do not rush on
death and ruin!remain to be our prop and stay, and hope everything from
time!""It is too late, Edith," answered Lord Evandale; "and I were most
ungenerous could I practise on the warmth and kindliness of your feelings
towards me.I know you cannot love me; nervous distress, so strong as to
conjure up the appearance of the dead or absent, indicates a predilection
too powerful to give way to friendship and gratitude alone.But were it
otherwise, the die is now cast."As he spoke thus, Cuddie burst into the room, terror and haste in his
countenance."Oh, my lord, hide yoursell!they hae beset the outlets o'
the house," was his first exclamation."A party of horse, headed by Basil Olifant," answered Cuddie.echoed Edith, in an agony of terror."What right has the
villain to assail me or stop my passage?I will make my way, were he
backed by a regiment; tell Halliday and Hunter to get out the horses.--
And now, farewell, Edith!"He clasped her in his arms, and kissed her
tenderly; then, bursting from his sister, who, with Lady Margaret,
endeavoured to detain him, rushed out and mounted his horse.All was in confusion; the women shrieked and hurried in consternation to
the front windows of the house, from which they could see a small party
of horsemen, of whom two only seemed soldiers.They were on the open
ground before Cuddie's cottage, at the bottom of the descent from the
house, and showed caution in approaching it, as if uncertain of the
strength within.said Edith; "oh, would he but take the
by-road!"But Lord Evandale, determined to face a danger which his high spirit
undervalued, commanded his servants to follow him, and rode composedly
down the avenue.Old Gudyill ran to arm himself, and Cuddie snatched down
a gun which was kept for the protection of the house, and, although on
foot, followed Lord Evandale.It was in vain his wife, who had hurried up
on the alarm, hung by his skirts, threatening him with death by the sword
or halter for meddling with other folk's matters."Hand your peace, ye b----," said Cuddie; "and that's braid Scotch, or I
wotna what is.Is it ither folk's matters to see Lord Evandale murdered
before my face?"But considering on the
way that he composed the whole infantry, as John Gudyill had not
appeared, he took his vantage ground behind the hedge, hammered his
flint, cocked his piece, and, taking a long aim at Laird Basil, as he was
called, stood prompt for action.As soon as Lord Evandale appeared, Olifant's party spread themselves a
little, as if preparing to enclose him.Their leader stood fast,
supported by three men, two of whom were dragoons, the third in dress and
appearance a countryman, all well armed.But the strong figure, stern
features, and resolved manner of the third attendant made him seem the
most formidable of the party; and whoever had before seen him could have
no difficulty in recognising Balfour of Burley."Follow me," said Lord Evandale to his servants, "and if we are forcibly
opposed, do as I do."He advanced at a hand gallop towards Olifant, and
was in the act of demanding why he had thus beset the road, when Olifant
called out, "Shoot the traitor!"and the whole four fired their carabines
upon the unfortunate nobleman.He reeled in the saddle, advanced his
hand to the holster, and drew a pistol, but, unable to discharge it, fell
from his horse mortally wounded.His servants had presented their
carabines.Hunter fired at random; but Halliday, who was an intrepid
fellow, took aim at Inglis, and shot him dead on the spot.At the same
instant a shot from behind the hedge still more effectually avenged Lord
Evandale, for the ball took place in the very midst of Basil Olifant's
forehead, and stretched him lifeless on the ground.His followers,
astonished at the execution done in so short a time, seemed rather
disposed to stand inactive, when Burley, whose blood was up with the
contest, exclaimed, "Down with the Midianites!"At this instant the clatter of horses' hoofs was heard,
and a party of horse, rapidly advancing on the road from Glasgow,
appeared on the fatal field.They were foreign dragoons, led by the Dutch
commandant Wittenbold, accompanied by Morton and a civil magistrate.A hasty call to surrender, in the name of God and King William, was
obeyed by all except Burley, who turned his horse and attempted to
escape.Several soldiers pursued him by command of their officer, but,
being well mounted, only the two headmost seemed likely to gain on him.He turned deliberately twice, and discharging first one of his pistols,
and then the other, rid himself of the one pursuer by mortally wounding
him, and of the other by shooting his horse, and then continued his
flight to Bothwell Bridge, where, for his misfortune, he found the gates
shut and guarded.Turning from thence, he made for a place where the
river seemed passable, and plunged into the stream, the bullets from the
pistols and carabines of his pursuers whizzing around him.Two balls took
effect when he was past the middle of the stream, and he felt himself
dangerously wounded.He reined his horse round in the midst of the river,
and returned towards the bank he had left, waving his hand, as if with
the purpose of intimating that he surrendered.The troopers ceased firing
at him accordingly, and awaited his return, two of them riding a little
way into the river to seize and disarm him.But it presently appeared
that his purpose was revenge, not safety.As he approached the two
soldiers, he collected his remaining strength, and discharged a blow on
the head of one, which tumbled him from his horse.The other dragoon, a
strong, muscular man, had in the mean while laid hands on him.Burley, in
requital, grasped his throat, as a dying tiger seizes his prey, and both,
losing the saddle in the struggle, came headlong into the river, and were
swept down the stream.Their course might be traced by the blood which
bubbled up to the surface.They were twice seen to rise, the Dutchman
striving to swim, and Burley clinging to him in a manner that showed his
desire that both should perish.Their corpses were taken out about a
quarter of a mile down the river.As Balfour's grasp could not have been
unclenched without cutting off his hands, both were thrown into a hasty
grave, still marked by a rude stone and a ruder epitaph.[Gentle reader, I did request of mine honest friend Peter Proudfoot,
     travelling merchant, known to many of this land for his faithful and
     just dealings, as well in muslins and cambrics as in small wares, to
     procure me on his next peregrinations to that vicinage, a copy of
     the Epitaphion alluded to.And, according to his report, which I see
     no ground to discredit, it runneth thus:--

               Here lyes ane saint to prelates surly,
               Being John Balfour, sometime of Burley,
               Who stirred up to vengeance take,
               For Solemn League and Cov'nant's sake,
               Upon the Magus-Moor in Fife,
               Did tak James Sharpe the apostate's life;
               By Dutchman's hands was hacked and shot,
               Then drowned in Clyde near this saam spot.]While the soul of this stern enthusiast flitted to its account, that of
the brave and generous Lord Evandale was also released.Morton had flung
himself from his horse upon perceiving his situation, to render his dying
friend all the aid in his power.He knew him, for he pressed his hand,
and, being unable to speak, intimated by signs his wish to be conveyed to
the house.This was done with all the care possible, and he was soon
surrounded by his lamenting friends.But the clamorous grief of Lady
Emily was far exceeded in intensity by the silent agony of Edith.Unconscious even of the presence of Morton, she hung over the dying man;
nor was she aware that Fate, who was removing one faithful lover, had
restored another as if from the grave, until Lord Evandale, taking their
hands in his, pressed them both affectionately, united them together,
raised his face as if to pray for a blessing on them, and sunk back and
expired in the next moment.I had determined to waive the task of a concluding chapter, leaving to
the reader's imagination the arrangements which must necessarily take
place after Lord Evandale's death.But as I was aware that precedents are
wanting for a practice which might be found convenient both to readers
and compilers, I confess myself to have been in a considerable dilemma,
when fortunately I was honoured with an invitation to drink tea with Miss
Martha Buskbody, a young lady who has carried on the profession of
mantua-making at Ganderscleugh and in the neighbourhood, with great
success, for about forty years.Knowing her taste for narratives of this
description, I requested her to look over the loose sheets the morning
before I waited on her, and enlighten me by the experience which she must
have acquired in reading through the whole stock of three circulating
libraries, in Ganderscleugh and the two next market-towns.When, with a
palpitating heart, I appeared before her in the evening, I found her much
disposed to be complimentary."I have not been more affected," said she, wiping the glasses of her
spectacles, "by any novel, excepting the 'Tale of Jemmy and Jenny
Jessamy', which is indeed pathos itself; but your plan of omitting a
formal conclusion will never do.You may be as harrowing to our nerves as
you will in the course of your story, but, unless you had the genius
of the author of 'Julia de Roubignd,' never let the end be altogether
overclouded.Let us see a glimpse of sunshine in the last chapter; it is
quite essential.""Nothing would be more easy for me, madam, than to comply with your
injunctions; for, in truth, the parties in whom you have had the goodness
to be interested, did live long and happily, and begot sons and
daughters.""It is unnecessary, sir," she said, with a slight nod of reprimand, "to
be particular concerning their matrimonial comforts.But what is your
objection to let us have, in a general way, a glimpse of their future
felicity?""Really, madam," said I, "you must be aware that every volume of a
narrative turns less and less interesting as the author draws to a
conclusion,--just like your tea, which, though excellent hyson, is
necessarily weaker and more insipid in the last cup.Now, as I think the
one is by no means improved by the luscious lump of half-dissolved sugar
usually found at the bottom of it, so I am of opinion that a history,
growing already vapid, is but dully crutched up by a detail of
circumstances which every reader must have anticipated, even though the
author exhaust on them every flowery epithet in the language."Pattieson," continued the lady; "you have, as I
may say, basted up your first story very hastily and clumsily at the
conclusion; and, in my trade, I would have cuffed the youngest apprentice
who had put such a horrid and bungled spot of work out of her hand.And
if you do not redeem this gross error by telling us all about the
marriage of Morton and Edith, and what became of the other personages of
the story, from Lady Margaret down to Goose-Gibbie, I apprise you that
you will not be held to have accomplished your task handsomely.""Well, madam," I replied, "my materials are so ample that I think I can
satisfy your curiosity, unless it descend to very minute circumstances
indeed.""First, then," said she, "for that is most essential,--Did Lady Margaret
get back her fortune and her castle?""She did, madam, and in the easiest way imaginable, as heir, namely, to
her worthy cousin, Basil Olifant, who died without a will; and thus, by
his death, not only restored, but even augmented, the fortune of her,
whom, during his life, he had pursued with the most inveterate malice.John Gudyill, reinstated in his dignity, was more important than ever;
and Cuddie, with rapturous delight, entered upon the cultivation of the
mains of Tillietudlem, and the occupation of his original cottage.But,
with the shrewd caution of his character, he was never heard to boast of
having fired the lucky shot which repossessed his lady and himself in
their original habitations.'After a',' he said to Jenny, who was his
only confidant, 'auld Basil Olifant was my leddy's cousin and a grand
gentleman; and though he was acting again the law, as I understand, for
he ne'er showed ony warrant, or required Lord Evandale to surrender, and
though I mind killing him nae mair than I wad do a muircock, yet it's
just as weel to keep a calm sough about it.'He not only did so, but
ingeniously enough countenanced a report that old Gudyill had done the
deed,--which was worth many a gill of brandy to him from the old butler,
who, far different in disposition from Cuddie, was much more inclined to
exaggerate than suppress his exploits of manhood.The blind widow was
provided for in the most comfortable manner, as well as the little guide
to the Linn; and--"

"But what is all this to the marriage,--the marriage of the principal
personages?"interrupted Miss Buskbody, impatiently tapping her
snuff-box."The marriage of Morton and Miss Bellenden was delayed for several
months, as both went into deep mourning on account of Lord Evandale's
death."I hope not without Lady Margaret's consent, sir?""I love books which teach a proper deference in young persons to their
parents.In a novel the young people may fall in love without their
countenance, because it is essential to the necessary intricacy of the
story; but they must always have the benefit of their consent at last.Even old Delville received Cecilia, though the daughter of a man of low
birth.""And even so, madam," replied I, "Lady Margaret was prevailed on to
countenance Morton, although the old Covenanter, his father, stuck sorely
with her for some time.Edith was her only hope, and she wished to see
her happy; Morton, or Melville Morton, as he was more generally called,
stood so high in the reputation of the world, and was in every other
respect such an eligible match, that she put her prejudice aside, and
consoled herself with the recollection that marriage went by destiny, as
was observed to her, she said, by his most sacred Majesty, Charles the
Second of happy memory, when she showed him the portrait of her
grand-father Fergus, third Earl of Torwood, the handsomest man of his
time, and that of Countess Jane, his second lady, who had a hump-back
and only one eye.This was his Majesty's observation, she said, on one
remarkable morning when he deigned to take his _disjune_--"

"Nay," said Miss Buskbody, again interrupting me, "if she brought such
authority to countenance her acquiescing in a misalliance, there was no
more to be said.--And what became of old Mrs.What's her name, the
housekeeper?""She was perhaps the happiest of the
party; for once a year, and not oftener, Mr.Melville Morton
dined in the great wainscotted chamber in solemn state, the hangings
being all displayed, the carpet laid down, and the huge brass candlestick
set on the table, stuck round with leaves of laurel.The preparing the
room for this yearly festival employed her mind for six months before it
came about, and the putting matters to rights occupied old Alison the
other six, so that a single day of rejoicing found her business for all
the year round.""Lived to a good old age, drank ale and brandy with guests of all
persuasions, played Whig or Jacobite tunes as best pleased his customers,
and died worth as much money as married Jenny to a cock laird.I hope,
ma'am, you have no other inquiries to make, for really--"

"Goose-Gibbie, sir?"said my persevering friend,--"Goose-Gibbie, whose
ministry was fraught with such consequences to the personages of the
narrative?""Consider, my dear Miss Buskbody, (I beg pardon for the
familiarity),--but pray consider, even the memory of the renowned
Scheherazade, that Empress of Tale-tellers, could not preserve every
circumstance.I am not quite positive as to the fate of Goose-Gibbie,
but am inclined to think him the same with one Gilbert Dudden, alias
Calf-Gibbie, who was whipped through Hamilton for stealing poultry."Miss Buskbody now placed her left foot on the fender, crossed her right
leg over her knee, lay back on the chair, and looked towards the ceiling.When I observed her assume this contemplative mood, I concluded she was
studying some farther cross-examination, and therefore took my hat and
wished her a hasty good-night, ere the Demon of Criticism had supplied
her with any more queries.In like manner, gentle Reader, returning you
my thanks for the patience which has conducted you thus far, I take the
liberty to withdraw myself from you for the present.It was mine earnest wish, most courteous Reader, that the "Tales of my
Landlord" should have reached thine hands in one entire succession of
tomes, or volumes.But as I sent some few more manuscript quires,
containing the continuation of these most pleasing narratives, I was
apprised, somewhat unceremoniously, by my publisher that he did not
approve of novels (as he injuriously called these real histories)
extending beyond four volumes, and if I did not agree to the first four
being published separately, he threatened to decline the article.as if the vernacular article of our mother English were
capable of declension.)Whereupon, somewhat moved by his remonstrances,
and more by heavy charges for print and paper, which he stated to have
been already incurred, I have resolved that these four volumes shall be
the heralds or avant-couriers of the Tales which are yet in my
possession, nothing doubting that they will be eagerly devoured, and the
remainder anxiously demanded, by the unanimous voice of a discerning
public.I rest, esteemed Reader, thine as thou shalt construe me,

report of him as he was passing out of his hands to Haileybury.Inglis notes on the letter: ‘Dr.Niblock is esteemed one of the best
Greek scholars in England, and his Greek Grammar is the one in use in
Eton.’

 ‘Of Master David Inglis I can speak with pleasure and pride almost
 unmixed.I can only loudly express how I regret that I have not the
 finishing of such a boy, for I feel, and shall ever feel, that he
 is _mine_.He has long begun to do what few boys do till they are
 leaving, or have left, school, viz.I shall long cherish the
 hope, that as I laid the foundation, so shall I have the power and
 pleasure of crowning my own and other’s labours.He will make a fine
 fellow and be a comfort to his parents, and an honour to his tutor.’

John Inglis received a nomination for Haileybury College from one of
the directors of the East India Company, and went there as a student in
1839.There he was noted as a cricketer and a good horseman, and also
for his reading.He knew Shakespeare almost by heart, and could tell
where to find any quotation from his works.On leaving Haileybury he
sailed for Calcutta, and was there for two years learning the language.He married in 1846, and in
1847 he was transferred to the newly-acquired province of the Punjab.He was sent as magistrate to Sealkote, remaining there till 1856.He then brought his family home on three years’ furlough.With the
outbreak of the Mutiny all civilians were recalled, and he returned to
India in 1858.He was sent to Bareilly to take part in the suppression
of the Mutiny, and was attached to the force under General Jones.He
was present at the action at Najibabad, with the recapture of Bareilly,
and the pacification of the province of Rohilcund.He remained in the
province ten years till 1868, and during those years he rose to be
Commissioner of Rohilcund.In 1868 he was made a member of the Board
of Revenue in the North-West Provinces.As a member of the Legislative
Council of India, he moved, in 1873, to Calcutta.From 1875 to 1877 he
was Chief Commissioner of Oude.The position Inglis made for himself in India, in yet early life, is
to be gauged by a letter written in 1846 by Sir Frederick Currie, who
was then Commissioner of Lahore.Thomasen (Lieutenant-Governor of the N.W.P.)for young civilians for the work which is now before us, and we must
 take several with us into the Punjab.One whom he strongly recommends
 is Inglis at Agra.Sir Henry
 Hardinge (the Governor-General) has not seen the letter yet.“Another
 man who might suit you is Inglis at Agra; an assistant on £400,
 acting as joint magistrate which gives him one hundred more.Active,
 energetic, conciliating to natives, fine-tempered, and thoroughly
 honest in all his works.I am not sure that he is not as good a man as
 you can have.I shall be glad to hear that you send for him.”’

The letter was addressed to Inglis’ eighteen-year-old bride, and Sir
Frederick goes on:--

 ‘Shall I send for him or not?I am almost sure I should have done
 so, had I not heard of your getting hold of his heart.We don’t
 want _heartless_ men, but really you have no right to keep _such_ a
 man from us.At the present moment, however, for your sake, little
 darling, I won’t take him from his present work, but if, after the
 honeymoon, he would prefer active and stirring employment, with the
 prospect of distinction, to the light-winged toys of feathered cupid,
 I dare say I shall be able to find an opening for him.’

Mr.Inglis’ wife was Harriet Louis Thompson, one of nine daughters.Her father was one of the first Indian civilians in the old company’s
days.All of the nine sisters married men in the Indian Civil, with
the exception of one who married an army officer.Harriet came out
to her parents in India when she was seventeen, and she married in
her eighteenth year.She must have been a girl of marked character
and ability.She met her future husband at a dance in her father’s
house, and she appears to have been the first to introduce the waltz
into India.She was a fine rider, and often drove tandem in India.She must have had a steady nerve, for her letters are full of various
adventures in camp and tiger-haunted jungles, and most of them narrate
the presence of one of her infants who was accompanying the parents on
their routine of Indian official life.Her daughter says of her:--

 ‘She was deeply religious.Some years after their marriage, when she
 must have been a little over thirty and was alone in England with the
 six elder children, she started and ran most successfully a large
 working-men’s club in Southampton.Such a thing was not as common
 as it is to-day.There she lectured on Sunday evenings on religious
 subjects to the crowded hall of men.’

In the perfectly happy home of the Inglis family in India, the Indian
ayah was one of the household in love and service to those she served.Simson has supplied some memories of this faithful retainer:--

 ‘The early days, the nursery days in the life of a family, are always
 looked back upon with loving interest, and many of us can trace to
 them many sweet and helpful influences.So it was with our early days,
 though the nursery was in India, and the dear nurse who lives in
 our memories was an Indian.She came into
 our family when the eldest of us was born, and remained one of the
 household for more than thirty years.Her husband came with her, and
 in later years three of her sons were table servants.Sona came home
 with us in 1857, and remained in England till the beginning of 1858.It was a sign of great attachment to us, for she left her own family
 away up in the Punjab, and fared out in the long sea voyage, into a
 strange country and among new peoples.She made friends wherever she
 was, and her stay in England was a great help to her in after life.When I returned to India after my school life at home, I found the
 dear nurse of my childhood days installed again as nurse to the little
 sisters and brother I found there.‘She was a sweet, gentle woman, and we never learnt anything but kind,
 gentle ways from her.By the time I returned she was recognised by the
 whole compound of servants as one to be looked up to and respected.She became a Christian and was baptized in 1877, but long before
 she made profession of her faith by baptism she lived a consistent
 Christian life.My dear mother’s influence was strong with her, and
 she was a reader of the Bible.One of my earliest recollections is our
 reading together the fourteenth chapter of St.‘She died some years after we had all settled in Scotland.My parents
 left her, with a small pension for life, in charge of the missionaries
 at Lucknow.When she died, they wrote to us saying that old Sona had
 been one of the pillars of the Indian Christian Church in Lucknow.‘We look forward with a sure and certain hope to our reunion in the
 home of many mansions, with her, around whom our hearts still cling
 with love and affection.’

In 1856 Mr.Inglis resolved to come home on furlough, accompanied by
Mrs.Inglis, and what was called ‘the first family,’ namely, the six
boys and one girl born to them in India.It was a formidable journey
to accomplish even without children, and one writes, ‘How mother stood
it all I cannot imagine.’ They came down from the Punjab to Calcutta
trekking in dâk garris.It took four months to reach Calcutta by this
means of progression, and another four months to come home by the Cape.The wonderful ayah, Sona, was a great help in the toilsome journey when
they brought the children back to England.Inglis was soon to
have her first parting with her husband.When they landed in England,
news of the outbreak of the Mutiny met them, and Mr.Inglis returned
almost at once to take his place beside John Lawrence.Together they
fought through the Mutiny, and then he worked under him.Inglis was
one of John Lawrence’s men in the great settling of the Punjab which
followed on that period of stress and strain in the Empire of India.His own district was Bareilly, and the house where he lived in Sealkote
is still known as Inglis Sahib ke koti (Inglis Sahib’s house).His
children remember the thrilling stories he used to tell them of these
great days, and of the great men who made their history.His admiration was unbounded for those northern races of India.He
loved and respected them, and they, in their turn, gave him unbounded
confidence and affection.‘Every bit as good as an Englishman,’ was a
phrase often on his lips when speaking of the fine Sikhs and Punjabis
and Rajpoots.Englishwomen were not allowed in India during this period, and Mrs.Inglis had to remain in Southampton with her six children and their
ayah.It was then that she found work in her leisure time for the work
she did in the Men’s Club.In 1863, when life in India had resumed its normal course, Mrs.Inglis
rejoined her husband, leaving the children she had brought back at home.It must have taken all the ‘fortitude’ that Mary Deas had shown long
before in Carolina to face this separation.There was no prospect of
the running backwards and forwards, which steam was so soon to develop,
and to draw the dominions into closer bonds.Letters took months to
pass, and no cable carried the messages of life and death across ‘the
white-lipped seas.’ Again, one of the survivors says: ‘I always felt
even as a child, and am sure of it now, she left her heart behind with
the six elder children.What it must have meant to a woman of her deep
nature, I cannot imagine.’ The decision was made, and Mr.Inglis was to
have the great reward of her return to him, after his seven years of
strenuous and anxious loneliness.The boys were sent, three of them to
Eton, and two more to Uppingham and to Rugby.Amy Inglis the daughter
was left with friends.Relatives were not lacking in this large clan
and its branches, and the children were ‘looked after’ by them.We owe
much of our knowledge of ‘the second little family,’ which were to
comfort the parents in India, by the correspondence concerning them
with the dearly-loved children left in the homelands.CHAPTER II

ELSIE MAUD INGLIS

1864-1917

    ‘Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the
    womb is His reward.As arrows are in the hand of the mighty man, so
    are children of the youth.Happy is the man that hath his quiver
    full of them; they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with
    the enemies in the gate.’


      NAINI TAL, _Aug.‘MY DARLING AMY,--Thank God, I am able to tell you that your dearest
 mother, and your little sister who was born this morning are well.Aunt Ellen thinks that baby is very like your dearest mother, but I
 do not see the resemblance at present.We
 could not form a better wish for her, than that she may grow up like
 her dear mother in every respect.Old Sona is quite delighted to have
 another baby to look after again.She took possession of her the
 moment she was born, as she has done with all of you.The nurse says
 she is a very strong and healthy baby.I wish to tell you as early as
 possible the good news of God’s great mercy and goodness towards us in
 having brought your dearest mother safely through this trial.’

Mrs.Inglis writes a long account of Elsie at a month old, and says she
is supposed to have a temper, as she makes herself heard all over the
house, and strongly objects to being brought indoors and put into her
cradle.In October she writes how the two babies, her own and Aunt Ellen’s
little boy, had been taken to church to be baptized, the one by the
name of Elsie Maude, the other Cyril Powney.Both children were
thriving, and no one would know that there were two babies in the
house.‘Elsie always stares very hard at papa when he comes to speak
to her, as if she did not quite know what to make of his black beard,
something different to what she is accustomed to see, but she generally
ends by laughing at him’--the first notice of that radiant friendship
in which father and daughter were to journey together in a happy
pilgrimage through life.Elsie had early to make long driving expeditions with her parents, and
her mother reports her as ‘accommodating herself to circumstances,
watching the trees, sleeping under them, and the jolliest little
traveller I ever saw.’

In December 1864 Mrs.Inglis reports their return from camp:--

 ‘It has been most extraordinarily warm for the time of year, and
 there has been very little rain during the whole twelvemonth.People
 attribute it to the wonderful comet which has been visible in the
 southern hemisphere.Elsie is very well, but she is a very little
 thing with a very wee face.She has a famous pair of large blue eyes,
 and it is quite remarkable how she looks about her and seems to
 observe everything.She lies in her bed at night in the dark and talks
 away out loud in her own little language, and little voice, and she is
 always ready for a laugh.’

Later on Mrs.Inglis writes: ‘I think she is one of the most
intelligent babies I ever met with.’

Every letter descriptive of the dark, blue-eyed baby with the fast
growing light hair, speaks of the smile ready for every one who speaks
to her, and the hearty laughs which seem to have been one of her
earliest characteristics.One journey tried Elsie’s philosophy of taking life as she found it.Inglis writes to her daughter:--

      NAINI TAL, 1865.‘We came in palkies from Beharin to a place called Jeslie, half way
 up the hill to Naini Tal, and were about ten hours in the palkies.I
 had arranged to have Elsie with me in my palkie, but the little monkey
 did not like being away from Sona, and then the strangeness of the
 whole proceedings bewildered her, and the noise of the bearers seemed
 to frighten her, so I was obliged to make her over to Sona.She went
 to sleep after a little while.As we came near the hills it became
 cold and a wind got up, and then Papa brought her back to me, for we
 did not quite like her being in Sona’s doolie, which was not so well
 protected as mine.She had become more reconciled to the disagreeables
 of dâk travelling by that time.We reached our house about nine
 o’clock yesterday morning.The change from the dried-up hot plains is
 very pleasant.You may imagine how often I longed for the railroad and
 our civilised English way of travelling.’

Mrs.Shaw M‘Laren, the companion sister of Elsie, and to whom her
correspondence always refers, has written down some memories of the
happy childhood days in India.The year was divided between the plains
and the hills of India.Elsie was born in August 1864, at Naini Tal,
one of the most beautiful hill stations in the Himalayas.From the
verandah, where much of the day was spent, the view was across the
masses of ‘huddled hills’ to the ranges crowned by the everlasting
snows.An outlook of silent and majestic stillness, and one which
could not fail to influence such a spirit as shone out in the always
wonderful eyes of Elsie.She grew up with the vision of the glory of
the earthly dominion, and it gave a new meaning to the kingdom of the
things of the spirit.‘All our childhood is full of remembrances of “Father.” He never
 forgot our birthdays; however hot it was down in the scorched plains,
 when the day came round, if we were up in the hills, a large parcel
 would arrive from him.His very presence was joy and strength when he
 came to us at Naini Tal.What a remembrance there is of early walks
 and early breakfasts with him and the three of us.The table was
 spread in the verandah between six and seven.Father made three cups
 of cocoa, one for each of us, and then the glorious walk!Three ponies
 followed behind, each with their attendant grooms, and two or three
 red-coated chaprasis, father stopping all along the road to talk to
 every native who wished to speak to him, while we three ran about,
 laughing and interested in everything.Then, at night, the shouting
 for him after we were in bed and father’s step bounding up the stair
 in Calcutta, or coming along the matted floor of our hill home.All
 order and quietness flung to the winds while he said good night to us.‘It was always understood that Elsie and he were special chums, but
 that never made any jealousy.The three cups
 of cocoa were exactly the same in quality and quantity.We got equal
 shares of his right and his left hand in our walks, but Elsie and he
 were comrades, inseparables from the day of her birth.‘In the background of our lives there was always the quiet strong
 mother, whose eyes and smile live on through the years.Every morning
 before the breakfast and walk, there were five minutes when we sat
 in front of her in a row on little chairs in her room and read the
 scripture verses in turn, and then knelt in a straight, quiet row and
 repeated the prayers after her.Only once can I remember father being
 angry with any of us, and that was when one of us ventured to hesitate
 in instant obedience to some wish of hers.I still see the room in
 which it happened, and the thunder in his voice is with me still.’

Both Mr.Inglis belonged to the Anglican Church, though they
never hesitated to go to any denomination where they found the best
spiritual life.In later life in Edinburgh, they were connected with
the Free Church of Scotland.To again quote from his daughter: ‘His
religious outlook was magnificently broad and beautiful, and his belief
in God simple and profound.His devotion to our mother is a thing
impossible to speak about, but we all feel that in some intangible way
it influenced and beautified our childhood.’

In 1870 Mrs.Inglis writes of the lessons of Elsie and her sister Eva.Marwood, is successful as a teacher; it comes easy
enough to Elsie to learn, and she delights in stories being told her.Every morning after their early morning walk, and while their baths
are being got ready, their mother says they come to her to say their
prayers and learn their Bible lesson.’ There are two letters more or
less composed by Elsie and written by her father.In as far as they
were dictated by herself, they take stock of independent ways, and the
spirit of the Pharisee is early developed in the courts of the Lord’s
House, as she manages not to fall asleep all the time, while the weaker
little sister slumbers and sleeps.Eva, the sleepy sister, has some further reminiscences of these nursery
days:--

 ‘We had forty dolls!Elsie decreed once that they should all have
 measles--so days were spent by us three painting little red dots all
 over the forty faces and the forty pairs of arms and legs.She was the
 doctor and prescribed gruesome drugs which we had to administer.Then
 it was decreed that they should slowly recover, so each day so many
 spots were washed off until the epidemic was wiped out!‘Another time one of the forty dolls was lost!Maria was small and
 ugly, but much loved, and the search for her was _tremendous_, but
 unsuccessful.After all there were
 plenty other dolls--never mind Maria!Father would find her when he came home from Kutcherry
 in the evening, if nobody else could.So father was told with many
 tears of Maria’s disappearance.The
 next day all the enormous staff of Indian servants, numbering all
 told about thirty or so, were had up in a row and told that unless
 Maria was found sixpence would be cut from each servant’s pay for
 interminable months!and Maria came to light
 within half an hour--in the pocket of one of the dresses of her little
 mistress found by one of the ayahs!Her mistress declared at the time,
 and always maintained with undiminished certainty, that she had first
 been put there, and then found by the ayah in question during that
 half-hour’s search!’

These reminiscences have more of interest than just the picture of
the little child who was to carry on the early manifestations of a
keen interest in life.A smile, surely one of the clouds of glory she
trailed from heaven, and carried back untarnished by the tragedies of a
stricken earth; they are chiefly valuable in the signs of a steadfast,
independent will.The interest of all Elsie’s early development lay in
the comradeship with a father whose wide benevolence and understanding
love was to be the guide and helper in his daughter’s career.Not for
the first time in the history of outstanding lives, the daughter has
been the friend, and not the subjugated child of a selfish and dominant
parent.The date of Elsie’s birth was in the dawn of the movement which
believed it possible that women could have a mind and a brain of their
own, and that the freedom of the one and the cultivation of the other
was not a menace to the possessive rights of the family, or the ruin
of society at large.Thousands of women born at the same date were
instructed that the aim of their lives must be to see to the creature
comforts of their male parent, and when he was taken from them, to
believe it right that he had neither educated them, nor made provision
for the certain old age and spinsterdom which lay before the majority.There have been many parents who gave their daughters no reason to
call them blessed, when they were left alone unprovided with gear or
education.In all periods of family history, such instances as Mr.Inglis’ outlook for his daughters is uncommon.He desired for them
equal opportunities, and the best and highest education.He gave them
the best of his mind, not its dregs, and a comradeship which made a
rare and happy entrance for them into life’s daily toil and struggle.The father asked for nothing but their love, and he had his own
unselfish devotion returned to him a hundredfold.It must have been a great joy to him to watch the unfolding of talent
and great gifts in this daughter who was always ‘his comrade.’ He could
not live to see the end of a career so blessed, so rich in womanly
grace and sustaining service, but he knew he had spared no good thing
he could bring into her life, and when her mission was fulfilled, then,
those who read and inwardly digest these pages will feel that she first
learnt the secret of service to mankind in the home of her father.CHAPTER III

THE LADDER OF LEARNING

1876-1885

    ‘Hast thou come with the heart of thy childhood back:
      The free, the pure, the kind?So murmured the trees in my homeward track,
      As they played to the mountain wind.‘Hath thy soul been true to its early love?Hath the spirit nurs’d amid hill and grove,
      Still revered its first high dream?’


After Mr.Inglis had been Chief Commissioner of Oude, he decided
to retire from his long and arduous service.Had he been given the
Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-West, as was expected by some in
the service, he would probably have accepted it and remained longer in
India.He was not in sympathy with Lord Lytton’s Afghan policy, and
that would naturally alter his desire for further employment.As with his father before him, his work was highly appreciated
by those he served.Lord Lytton, the Viceroy, in a letter to Lord
Salisbury, then Secretary of State for India, writes, February 1876:--

 ‘During the short period of my own official tenure I have met with
 much valuable assistance from Mr.Inglis, both as a member of my
 Legislative Council, and also as officiating Commissioner in Oudh,
 more especially as regards the amalgamation of Oudh with the N.W.Of his character and abilities I have formed so high an
 opinion that had there been an available vacancy I should have been
 glad to secure to my government his continued services.’

Two of Mr.Inglis’ sons had settled in Tasmania, and it was decided to
go there before bringing home the younger members of his family.Simson, was now married and settled in Edinburgh,
and the Inglis determined to make their home in that city.Two years were spent in Hobart settling the two sons on the land.M‘Laren says:--

 ‘When in Tasmania, Elsie and I went to a very good school.Miss Knott,
 the head-mistress, had come out from Cheltenham College for Girls.Here in the days when such things were practically unknown, Elsie,
 backed by Miss Knott, instituted ‘school colours.’ They were very
 primitive, not beautiful hatbands, but two inches of blue and white
 ribbon sewn on to a safety pin, and worn on the lapel of our coats.How proud we were of them.’

Mr.Inglis, writing to his daughter in Edinburgh, says of their school
life:--

 ‘Elsie has done very well, she is in the second class and last week
 got up to second in the class.‘We are all in a whirl having to sort and send off our boxes, some
 round the Cape, some to Melbourne, and some to go with us.’

Mrs.Inglis, on board the _Durham_ homeward bound, writes:--

 ‘Elsie has found occupation for herself in helping to nurse sick
 children, and look after turbulent boys who trouble everybody on
 board, and a baby of seven months old is an especial favourite with
 her.Eva has met with a bosom friend in a little girl named Pearly
 Macmillan, without whom she would have collapsed altogether.Our
 vessel is not a fast one, but we have been only five instead of six
 weeks getting to Suez.’

The family took a house at 70 Bruntsfield Place, and the two girls were
soon at school.M‘Laren says:--

 ‘Elsie and I used to go daily to the Charlotte Square Institution,
 which used in those days to be the Edinburgh school for girls.Father never approved of the Scotch custom
 of children walking long distances to school, and we used to be sent
 every morning in a cab.The other day, when telling the story of the
 S.W.H.’s to a large audience of working women in Edinburgh, one woman
 said to me, “My husband is a prood man the day!He tells everybody how
 he used to drive Dr.Inglis to school every morning when she was a
 girl.”’

Of her school life in Edinburgh, Miss Wright gives these memories:--

 ‘I remember quite distinctly when the girls of 23 Charlotte Square
 were told that two girls from Tasmania were coming to the school,
 and a certain feeling of surprise that the said girls were just like
 ordinary mortals, though the big, earnest brows and the quaint hair
 parted in the middle and done up in plaits fastened up at the back
 of the head were certainly not ordinary.Elsie was put in a higher
 English class than I was in, and though I knew her, I did not know her
 very well.‘A friend has a story of a question going round the class, she thinks
 Clive or Warren Hastings was the subject of the lesson, and the
 question was what one would do if a calumny were spread about one.“Deny it,” one girl answered.“Live it down,” said Elsie.“Right, Miss Inglis.” My
 friend writes, “The question I cannot remember, it was the bright
 confident smile with the answer, and Mr.Hossack’s delighted wave to
 the top of the class that abides in my memory.”

 ‘I always think a very characteristic story of Elsie is her asking
 that the school might have permission to play in Charlotte Square
 gardens.In those days no one thought of providing fresh air exercise
 for girls except by walks, and tennis was just coming in.Elsie had
 the courage (to us schoolgirls it seemed the extraordinary courage)
 to confront the three directors of the school and ask if we might be
 allowed to play in the gardens of the Square.The three directors
 together were to us the most formidable and awe-inspiring body, though
 separately they were amiable and estimable men!‘The answer was we might play in the gardens if the neighbouring
 proprietors would give their consent, and the heroic Elsie, with I
 think one other girl, actually went round to each house in the Square
 and asked consent of the owner.‘In those days the inhabitants of Charlotte Square were very select
 and exclusive indeed, and we all felt it was a brave thing to do.Elsie gained her point, and the girls played at certain hours in the
 Square till a regular playing field was arranged.’

Her sister Eva reports that the first answer of the directors was
enough for the rest of the school.But Elsie, undaunted, interviewed
each of the three directors herself.After every bell in Charlotte
Square had been rung and all interviewed, she returned from this great
expedition triumphant.All had consented, so the damsels interned from
nine to three were given the gardens, and the grim, dull, palisaded
square must have suddenly been made to blossom like the rose.Would
that some follower of Elsie Inglis even now might ring the door bells
and get the gates unlocked to the rising generation.Elsie’s companion
or companions in this first attempt to influence those in authority
have been spoken of as ‘her first unit.’

Elsie was, for a time, joint editor of the _Edina_, a school magazine
of the ordinary type.Her great achievement was in making it pay,
which, it is recorded, no other editor was able to do.There are
various editorial anxieties alluded to in her correspondence with her
father.The memories quoted take us further than school days, but they
find a fitting place here.‘Our more intimate acquaintance came after Mrs.Inglis’ death and when
 Elsie was thinking of and beginning her medical work.In 1888 six of
 us girls who had been at the same school started the “Six Sincere
 Students Society,” which met in one house.The first year we read and
 discussed Emerson’s Essays on “Self-Reliance and Heroism.” I am pretty
 sure it was Elsie who suggested those Essays.Also, Helps, and Matthew
 Arnold’s _Culture and Anarchy_.I have a note on this “two very hot
 discussions as to what Culture means, and if it is sufficiently
 powerful to regenerate the world.Culture of the masses and also of
 women largely gone into.”

 ‘This very friendly and happy society lasted on till 1891, when it
 was enlarged and became a Debating Society.I find Elsie taking up
 such subjects as “That our modern civilisation is a development not a
 degeneration.” “That character is formed in a busy life rather than
 in solitude.” Papers on Henry Drummond’s _Ascent of Man_, and on the
 “Ethics of War.”

 ‘Always associated with Elsie in those days I think of her father,
 and no biography of her will be true which does not emphasise the
 beautiful and deep love and sympathy between Elsie and Mr.He
 used to meet us girls as if we were his intellectual equals, and would
 discuss problems and answer our questions with the utmost cordiality
 and appreciation of our point of view, and always there was the
 feeling of the entire understanding and fellowship between father and
 daughter.‘She was a keen croquet player, and tolerated no frivolity when a
 stroke either at croquet or golf were in the balance.She was fond of
 long walks with Mr.Inglis, and then by herself, and time never hung
 on her hands in holiday time, she was always serene and happy.’

It was decided that Elsie should go to school in Paris in September
1882--a decision not lightly made; and Mr.Inglis writes after her
departure:--

 ‘I do not think I could have borne to part with you, my darling, did
 I not feel the assurance that in doing so we are following the Lord’s
 guidance.Your dear mother and I both made it the subject of earnest
 prayer, and I feel we have been guided to do what was best for you;
 and we shall see this when the weary time is over, and we have got you
 back again with us.‘When I return to Edinburgh, I feel that I shall have no one to find
 out my Psalms for me, or to cut my _Spectator_, that we shall have
 no more discussions regarding the essays of Mr.Fraser, and no more
 anxieties about the forthcoming number of the _Edina_.The nine months
 will pass quickly.’

Elsie’s letters from Paris have not been preserved, but the ones
from her father show the alert intelligence and interest in all she
was reporting.Of the events at home and abroad, Mr.Inglis writes
to her of the Suez Canal, the bringing to justice of the Phœnix Park
murderers, the great snowstorm at home, and the Channel Tunnel.Inglis writes with maternal scepticism on some passing events: ‘I
cannot imagine you making the body of your dress.I think there would
not be many carnivals if you had to make the dresses yourselves.’
Mr.Inglis, equally sceptical, has a more satisfactory solution for
dressmaking.‘I hope you have more than one dinner frock, two or three,
and let them be pretty ones.’ Mrs.Inglis, commenting on Elsie’s
description of Gambetta’s funeral, says: ‘He is a loss to France.Poor France, she always seems to me like a vessel without a helm
driven about just where the winds take it.She has no sound Christian
principle to guide her.So different from our highly favoured England.’

Mr.Inglis’ letters are full of the courteous consideration for Elsie
and for others which marked all the way of his life, and made him
the man greatly beloved, in whatever sphere he moved._Punch_ and
the _Spectator_ went from him every week, and he writes: ‘I hope
there was nothing in that number of _Punch_ you gave M. Survelle to
study while you were finishing your breakfast to hurt his feelings
as a Frenchman._Punch_ has not been very complimentary to them of
late.’ And when Elsie’s sense of humour had been moved by a saying
of her _gouvernante_, Mr.Inglis writes, desirous of a very free
correspondence with home, but--

 ‘I fear if I send your letter to Eva, at school, that your remark
 about Miss ---- proposal to go down to the lower flat of your house,
 because the Earl of Anglesea once lived there, may be repeated and
 ultimately reach her with exaggerations, as those things always do,
 and may cause unpleasant feelings.’

There must have been some exhibition of British independence, and in
dealing with it Mr.Inglis reminds Elsie of a day in India ‘when you
went off for a walk by yourself, and we all thought you were lost, and
all the Thampanies and chaprasies and everybody were searching for you
all over the hill.’ One later episode was not on a hillside, and except
for _les demoiselles_ in Paris, equally harmless.1883._

 ‘I can quite sympathise with you, my darling, in the annoyance you
 feel at not having told Miss Brown of your having walked home part
 of the way from Madame M---- last Wednesday.It would have been far
 better if you had told her, as you wished to do, what had happened.Concealment is always wrong, and very often turns what was originally
 only a trifle into a serious matter.In this case, I don’t suppose
 Miss B. could have said much if you had told her, though she may be
 seriously angry if it comes to her knowledge hereafter.If she does
 hear of it, you had better tell her that you told me all about it, and
 that I advised you, under the circumstances, as you had not told her
 at the time, and that as by doing so now you could only get the others
 into trouble, not to say anything about it; but keep clear of these
 things for the future, my darling.’

When the end came here, in this life, one of her school-fellows wrote:--

 ‘Elsie has been and is such a world-wide inspiration to all who knew
 her.One more can testify to the blessedness of her friendship.Ever
 since the Paris days of ’83 her strong loving help was ready in
 difficult times, and such wonderfully strengthening comfort in sorrow.’

The Paris education ended in the summer of 1883, and Miss Brown, who
conducted and lived with the seven girls who went out with her from
England, writes after their departure:--

 ‘I cannot tell you how much I felt when you all disappeared, and how
 sad it was to go back to look at your deserted places.I cannot at all
 realise that you are now all separated, and that we may never meet
 again on earth.May we meet often at the throne of grace, and remember
 each other there.It is nice to have a French maid to keep up the
 conversations, and if you will read French aloud, even to yourself, it
 is of use.’

Paris was, no doubt, an education in itself, but the perennial hope of
fond parents that languages and music are in the air of the continent,
were once again disappointed in Elsie.She was timber-tuned in ear and
tongue, and though she would always say her mind in any vehicle for
thought, the accent and the grammar strayed along truly British lines.Her eldest niece supplies a note on her music:--

 ‘She was still a schoolgirl when they returned from Tasmania.At that
 time she was learning music at school.I thought her a wonderful
 performer on the piano, but afterwards her musical capabilities
 became a family joke which no one enjoyed more than herself.She had
 two “pieces” which she could play by heart, of the regular arpeggio
 drawing-room style, and these always had to be performed at any family
 function as one of the standing entertainments.’

Elsie returned from Paris, the days of the schoolgirlhood left behind.Her character was formed, and she had the sense of latent powers.She
had not been long at home when her mother died of a virulent attack of
scarlet fever, and Mr.Inglis lost the lodestar of his loving nature.‘From that day Elsie shouldered all father’s burdens, and they two went
on together until his death.’

In her desk, when it was opened, these ‘Resolutions’ were found.They
are written in pencil, and belong to the date when she became the stay
and comfort of her father’s remaining years:--

 ‘I must give up dreaming,--making stories.‘I must devote my mind more to the housekeeping.‘I must be more thorough in everything.‘The bottom of the whole evil is the habit of dreaming, which must be
 given up.‘ELSIE INGLIS.’




CHAPTER IV

THE STUDENT DAYS

1885-1892

EDINBURGH--GLASGOW

    ‘Let knowledge grow from more to more,
      But more of reverence in us dwell;
      That mind and soul, according well,
    May make one music as before,
    But vaster.’


‘I remember well the day Elsie came in and, sitting down beside
father, divulged her plan of “going in for medicine.” I still see and
hear him, taking it all so perfectly calmly and naturally, and setting
to work at once to overcome the difficulties which were in the way, for
even then all was not plain sailing for the woman who desired to study
medicine.’ So writes Mrs.M‘Laren, looking back on the days when the
future doctor recognised her vocation and ministry.If it had been a
profession of ‘plain sailing,’ the adventurous spirit would probably
not have embarked in that particular vessel.The seas had only just
been charted, and not every shoal had been marked.In the midst of
them Elsie’s bark was to have its hairbreadth escapes.The University
Commission decided that women should not be excluded any longer from
receiving degrees owing to their sex.The writer recollects the
description given of the discussion by the late Sir Arthur Mitchell,
K.C.B., one of the most enlightened minds of the age in which he lived
and achieved so much.He, and one or more of his colleagues, presented
the Commissioners with the following problem: ‘Why not?On what theory
or doctrine was it just or beneficent to exclude women from University
degrees?’ There came no answer, for logic cannot be altogether
ignored by a University Commission, so, without opposition or blare
of trumpets, the Scottish Universities opened their degrees to all
students.It was of good omen that the Commission sat in high Dunedin,
under that rock bastion where Margaret, saint and queen, was the most
learned member of the Scottish nation in the age in which she reigned.Jex Blake had founded the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women,
and it was there that Elsie received her first medical teaching.Everything was still in its initial stages, and every step in the
higher education of women had to be fought and won, against the forces
of obscurantism and professional jealousy.University Commissions might issue reports, but the working out of them
was left in the hands of men who were determined to exclude women from
the medical profession.Clinical teaching could only be carried on in a few hospitals.Anatomy was learnt under the most discouraging circumstances.Mixed
classes were, and still are, refused.Extra-mural teaching became
complicated, on the one hand, by the extra fees which were wrung from
women students, and by the careless and perfunctory teaching accorded
by the twice-paid profession.Professors gave the off-scourings of
their minds, the least valuable of their subjects, and their unpunctual
attendance to all that stood for female students.It will hardly
be believed that the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh refused to admit
women to clinical teaching in the wards, until they had raised seven
hundred pounds to furnish two wards in which, and in which alone, they
might work.To these two wards, with their selected cases, they are
still confined, with the exception of one or two other less important
subjects.Medicals rarely belong to the moneyed classes, and very
few women can command the money demanded of the medical course, and
that women should have raised at once the tax thus put upon them by
the Royal Infirmary is an illustration of how keenly and bravely they
fought through all the disabilities laid upon them.The names of
many of them are written in gold in the story of the opening of the
profession to women.Paul had the note of
all great minds, a passion to share his knowledge of a great salvation,
with both Jews and Gentiles.That test of greatness was not conspicuous
in the majority of the medical profession at the time when Elsie Inglis
came as a learner to the gates of medical science.That kingdom, like
most others, had to suffer violence ere she was to be known as the good
physician in her native city and in those of the allied nations.There are no letters extant from Elsie concerning her time with Dr.Inglis decided to leave their
home at Bruntsfield, and the family moved to rooms in Melville Street.Here Elsie was with her father, and carried on her studies from his
house.It was not an altogether happy start, and very soon she had
occasion to differ profoundly with Dr.Jex Blake in her management
of the school.Two of the students failed to observe the discipline
imposed by Dr.Jex Blake, and she expelled them from the school.Any high-handed act of injustice always roused Elsie to keen and
concentrated resistance.Jex Blake,
and it was successful, proving in its course that the treatment of the
students had been without justification.Looking back on this period of the difficult task of opening the
higher education to women, it is easy to see the defects of many of
those engaged in the struggle.The attitude towards women was so
intolerably unjust that many of the pioneers became embittered in soul,
and had in their bearing to friends or opponents an air which was often
provocative of misunderstanding.They did not always receive from the
younger generation for whom they had fought that forbearance that must
be always extended to ‘the old guard,’ whose scars and defects are but
the blemishes of a hardly-contested battle.Success often makes people
autocratic, and those who benefit from the success, and suffer under
the overbearing spirit engendered, forget their great gains in the
galling sensation of being ridden over rough-shod.It is an episode on
which it is now unnecessary to dwell, and Dr.Inglis would always have
been the first to render homage to the great pioneer work of Dr.Through it all Elsie was living in the presence chamber of her father’s
chivalrous, high-minded outlook.Whatever action she took then, must
have had his approval, and it was from him that she received that keen
sense of equal justice for all.These student years threw them more than ever together.On Sundays
they worshipped in the morning in Free St.George’s Church, and in the
evening in the Episcopal Cathedral.Inglis was a great walker, and
Elsie said, ‘I learnt to walk when I used to take those long walks with
father, after mother died.’ Then she would explain how you _should_
walk.‘Your whole body should go into it, and not just your feet.’

Of these student days her niece, Evelyn Simson, says:--

 ‘When she was about eighteen she began to wear a bonnet on Sunday.She
 was the last _girl_ in our connection to wear one.My Aunt Eva who is
 two years younger never did, so I think the fashion must have changed
 just then.I remember thinking how very grown up she must be.’

Another niece writes:--

 ‘At the time when it became the fashion for girls to wear their hair
 short, when she went out one day, and came home with a closely-cropped
 head, I bitterly resented the loss of Aunt Elsie’s beautiful shining
 fair hair, which had been a real glory to her face.She herself was
 most delighted with the new style, especially with the saving of
 trouble in hairdressing.‘She only allowed her hair to grow long again because she thought
 it was better for a woman doctor to dress well and as becomingly as
 possible.This opinion only grew as she became older, and had been
 longer in the profession; in her student days she rather prided
 herself on not caring about personal appearance, and she dressed very
 badly.‘Her sense of fairplay was very strong.Once in college there was an
 opposition aroused to the Student Christian Union, and a report was
 spread that the students belonging to it were neglecting their college
 work.It happened to be the time for the class examinations, and the
 lists were posted on the College notice-board.The next morning,
 the initials C.U.were found printed opposite the names of all the
 students who belonged to the Christian Union, and, as these happened
 to head the list in most instances, the unfair report was effectually
 silenced.No one knew who had initialed the list; it was some time
 afterwards I discovered it had been Aunt Elsie.She embroidered and made entirely
 herself two lovely little flannel garments for her first grand-nephew,
 in the midst of her busy life, then filled to overflowing with the
 work of her growing practice, and of her suffrage activities.‘The babies as they arrived in the families met with her special love.In her short summer holidays with any of us, the children were her
 great delight.‘She was a great believer in an open-air life.One summer she took
 three of us a short walking tour from Callander, and we did enjoy it.We tramped over the hills, and finally arrived at Crianlarich, only to
 find the hotel crammed and no sleeping accommodation.She would take
 no refusal, and persuaded the manager to let us sleep on mattresses in
 the drawing-room, which added to the adventures of our trip.‘On the way she entertained us with tales of her college life, and
 imbued us with our first enthusiasm for the women’s cause.‘When I myself began to study medicine, no one could have been more
 enthusiastically encouraging, and even through the stormy and somewhat
 depressing times of the early career of the Medical College for Women,
 Edinburgh, her faith and vision never faltered, and she helped us all
 to hold on courageously.’

In 1891 Elsie went to Glasgow to take the examination for the Triple
Qualification at the Medical School there.She could not then take
surgery in Edinburgh, and the facilities for clinical teaching were all
more favourable in Glasgow.It was probably better for her to be away from all the difficulties
connected with the opening of the second School of Medicine for Women
in Edinburgh.Jex Blake was the Edinburgh School
of Medicine for Women, and the one promoted by Elsie Inglis and other
women students was known as the Medical College for Women.‘It was with
the fortunes of this school that she was more closely associated,’
writes Dr.In Glasgow she resided at the Y.W.C.A.Her father did not
wish her to live alone in lodgings, and she accommodated herself very
willingly to the conditions under which she had to live.Miss Grant,
the superintendent, became her warm friend.Elsie’s absence from home
enabled her to give a vivid picture of her life in her daily letters to
her father.‘GLASGOW, _Feb.‘It was not nice seeing you go off and being left all alone.After I
 have finished this letter I am going to set to work.It seems there
 are twelve or fourteen girls boarding here, and there are regular
 rules.Miss Grant told me if I did not like some of them to speak to
 her, but I am not going to be such a goose as that.One rule is you
 are to make your own bed, which she did not think I could do!But I
 said I could make it beautifully.I would much rather do what all the
 others do.Well, I arranged my room, and it is as neat as a new pin.Then we walked up to the hospital, to the dispensary; we were there
 till 4.30, as there were thirty-six patients, and thirty-one of them
 new.‘I am most comfortable here, and I am going to work like _anything_.I
 told Miss Barclay so, and she said, “Oh goodness, we shall all have to
 look out for our laurels!”’

      ‘_Feb.7, ’91._

 ‘Mary Sinclair says it is no good going to the dispensaries on
 Saturday, as there are no students there, and the doctors don’t take
 the trouble to teach.MacEwan’s wards this morning.I
 was the first there, so he let me help him with an operation; then I
 went over to Dr.9._

 ‘This morning I spent the whole time in Dr.I could not think what he meant, he asked me so
 many questions.It seems it is his way of greeting a new student.Some
 of them cannot bear him, but I think he is really nice, though he can
 be abominably sarcastic, and he is a first-rate surgeon and capital
 teacher.‘To-day, it was the medical jurists and the police officers he was
 down on, and he told story after story of how they work by red tape,
 according to the text-books.He said that, while he was casualty
 surgeon, one police officer said to him that it was no good having him
 there, for he never would try to make the medical evidence fit in with
 the evidence they had collected.Once they brought in a woman stabbed
 in her wrist, and said they had caught the man who had done it running
 away, and he had a knife.MacEwan said the cut had been done by
 glass and not by a knife, so they could not convict the man, and there
 was an awful row over it.Some of them went down to the alley where
 it had happened, and sure enough there was a pane of glass smashed
 right through the centre.When the woman knew she was found out, she
 confessed she had done it herself.The moral he impressed on us was to
 examine your patient before you hear the story.is beginning to get headaches and not sleep at night.I am
 thankful to say that is not one of my tricks.Miss G. is getting
 unhappy about her, and is going to send up beef-tea every evening.She offered me some, but I like my glass of milk much better.I am
 taking my tonic and my tramp regularly, so I ought to keep well.I am
 quite disgusted when girls break down through working too hard.They
 must remember they are not as strong as men, and then they do idiotic
 things, such as taking no exercise, into the bargain.MacEwan asked us to-day to get the first stray £20,000 we could
 for him, as he wants to build a proper private hospital.So I said he
 should have the second £20,000 I came across, as I wanted the first
 to build and endow a woman’s College in Edinburgh.He said he thought
 that would be great waste; there should not be separate colleges.“If
 women are going to be doctors, equal with the men, they should go to
 the same school.” I said I quite agreed with him, but when they won’t
 admit you, what are you to do?“Leave them alone,” he said; “they will
 admit you in time,” and he thought outside colleges would only delay
 that.MacEwan’s wards a very curious case came in.Some
 of us tried to draw it, never thinking he would see us, and suddenly
 he swooped round and insisted on seeing every one of the scribbles.He has eyes, I believe, in the back of his head and ears everywhere.He forgot, I thought, to have the ligature taken off a leg he was
 operating on, and I said so in the lowest whisper to M. S. About five
 minutes afterwards, he calmly looked straight over to us, and said,
 “_Now_, we’ll take off the ligature!”

 ‘I went round this morning and saw a few of my patients.I found one
 woman up who ought to have been in bed.I discovered she had been up
 all night because her husband came in tipsy about eleven o’clock.I think he ought to have been
 horse-whipped, and when I have the vote I shall vote that all men who
 turn their wives and families out of doors at eleven o’clock at night,
 especially when the wife is ill, shall be horse-whipped.And, if they
 make the excuse that they were tipsy, I should give them double.They
 would very soon learn to behave themselves.‘As to the father of the cherubs you ask about, his family does not
 seem to lie very heavily on his mind.He is not in work just now, and
 apparently is very often out of work.One cannot take things seriously
 in that house.‘In the house over the Clyde I saw the funniest sight.It is an Irish
 house, as dirty as a pig-sty, and there are about ten children.When
 I got there, at least six of the children were in the room, and half
 of them without a particle of clothing.They were sitting about on the
 table and on the floor like little cherubs with black faces.I burst
 out laughing when I saw them, and they all joined in most heartily,
 including the mother, though not one of them saw the joke, for they
 came and stood just as they were round me in a ring to see the baby
 washed.Suddenly, the cherubs began to disappear and ragged children
 to appear instead.I looked round to see who was dressing them, but
 there was no one there.They just slipped on their little black
 frocks, without a thing on underneath, and departed to the street as
 soon as the baby was washed.‘Three women with broken legs have come in.I don’t believe so many
 women have ever broken their legs together in one day before!One of
 them is a shirt finisher.She sews on the buttons and puts in the
 gores at the rate of 4½d.We know the shop, and they
 _sell_ the shirts at 4s.Of course, political economy is
 quite true, but I hope that shopkeeper, if ever he comes back to this
 earth, will be a woman and have to finish shirts at 4½d.a dozen, and
 then he’ll see the other side of the question.I told the woman it was
 her own fault for taking such small wages, at which she seemed amused.It is funny the stimulating effect a big school has on a hospital.The
 Royal here is nearly as big and quite as rich as the Edinburgh Royal,
 but there is no pretence that they really are in their teaching and
 arrangements the third hospital in the kingdom, as they are in size._The_ London Hospital is the biggest, and then comes Edinburgh, and
 this is the third.Guy’s and Bart.’s, that one hears so much about,
 are quite small in comparison, but they have big medical schools
 attached.The doctors seem to lie on their oars if they don’t have to
 teach.1892._

 ‘I thought the Emperor of Germany’s speech the most impertinent piece
 of self-glorification I ever met with.Steed’s egotism is perfect
 humility beside it.He and his house are the chosen instruments of
 “our supreme Lord,” and anybody who does not approve of what he does
 had better clear out of Germany.As you say, Makomet and Luther and
 all the great epoch-makers had a great belief in themselves and their
 mission, but the German Emperor will have to give some further proof
 of his divine commission (beyond a supreme belief in himself) before
 I, for one, will give in my submission.I
 think it was perfectly blasphemous.‘The _Herald_ has an article about wild women.Andrews has opened the flood-gates, and now there is the deluge.Andrews has done very well--degrees and mixed classes from next
 October.Don’t you think our Court might send a memorial to the
 University Court about medical degrees?It is splendid having Sir
 William Muir on our side, and I believe the bulk of the Senators are
 all right--they only want a little shove.’

In Glasgow the women students had to encounter the opposition to ‘mixed
classes,’ and the fight centred in the Infirmary.It would have been
more honest to have promulgated the decision of the Managers before
the women students had paid their fees for the full course of medical
tuition.Elsie, in her letters, describes the toughly fought contest, and the
final victory won by the help of the just and enlightened leaders in
the medical world.‘So here is another fight,’ writes the student, with
a sigh of only a half regret!It was too good a fight, and the backers
were too strong for the women students not to win their undoubted
rights.Through all the chaffing and laughter, one perceives the thread
of a resolute purpose, and Elsie’s great gift, the unconquerable facing
of ‘the Hill Difficulty.’ True, the baffled and puzzled enemy often
played into their hands, as when Dr.T., driven to extremity in a weak
moment, threatened to prevent their attendance by ‘physical force.’
The threat armed the students with yet another legal grievance.Elsie
describes on one occasion in her haste going into a ward where Dr.Gemmel, one of the ‘mixed’ objectors, was demonstrating.She perceived
her mistake, and retreated, not before receiving a smile from her
enemy.The now Sir William MacEwan enjoyed the fight quite as much as
his women students; and if to-day he notes the achievements of the
Scottish Women’s Hospitals, he may count as his own some of their
success in the profession in which he has achieved so worthy a name.The dispute went on until at length an exhausted foe laid down its
weapons, and the redoubtable Dr.T. conveyed the intimation that the
women students might go to any of the classes--and a benison on them!The faction fight, like many another in the brave days of old,
roared and clattered down the paved causeways of Glasgow.T., in
his gate-house, must have wished his petticoat foes many times away
and above the pass.If he, or any of the obstructionists of that day
survive, we know that they belong to a sect that needs no repentance.They may, however, note with self-complacency that their action trained
on a generation skilled in the contest of fighting for democratic
rights in the realm of knowledge.It is a birthright to enter into that
gateway, and the keys are given to all who possess the understanding
mind and reverent attitude towards all truth.1891._

 ‘Those old wretches, the Infirmary Managers, have reared their heads
 again, and now have decided that we are not to go to mixed classes,
 and we have been tearing all over the wards seeing all sorts of people
 about it.K.’s this morning--all right.Crossing the
 quadrangle, a porter rushed at me and said, “Dr.T. wants to see
 all the lady students at the gate-house.” I remarked to Miss M.,
 “I am certainly not going to trot after Dr.He can put up a notice if he wants me.” We were going
 upstairs to Dr.R. when another porter ran up and said, “Dr.He would be much obliged if you would speak to him.”
 So we laughed, and said that was more polite anyhow, and went into
 the office.So he hummed and hawed, looked everywhere except at
 us, and then said the Infirmary Managers said we were not to go to
 mixed classes.So I promptly said, “Then I shall come for my fees
 to-morrow,” and walked out of the room.K., who said he was awfuly sorry and angry, and he would
 see Dr.T., but he was afraid he could do nothing.But you see we cannot be beat here, for
 the same reason that we cannot beat them in Edinburgh.Were the
 managers, managers a hundred times over, they cannot turn Mr.‘The _Glasgow Herald_ had an article the other day, saying there
 was a radical change in the country, and that no one was taking any
 notice of it, and no one knew where it was to land us.This was the
 draft ordinance of the Commissioners which actually put the education
 of women on the same footing as that of men, and, worse still,
 seemed to countenance mixed classes.H._ seems to think this
 is the beginning of the end, and will necessarily lead to woman’s
 suffrage, and it will probably land them in the pulpit; because if
 they are ordinary University students they may compete for any of the
 bursaries, and many bursaries can only be held on condition that the
 holder means to enter the Church!You never read such an article, and
 it was not the least a joke but sober earnest.The chief reason I tried to get that
 prize was to pay for those things and not worry you about them.I want
 to pass awfully well, as it tells all one’s life through, and I _mean_
 to be very successful!B. has the most absurd way of agreeing with everything you say.He asked me what I would do with a finger.I thought it was past
 all mending and said, “Amputate it.” “Quite so, quite so,” he said
 solemnly, “but we’ll dress it to-day with such and such a thing.”
 There were two or three other cases in which I recommended desperate
 measures, in which he agreed, but did not follow.B. what he would do with a swelling.I said,
 “Open it.” Whereupon he went off into fits of laughter, and proclaimed
 to the whole room my prescriptions, and said I would make a first-rate
 surgeon for I was afraid of nothing.‘It is one thing to recommend treatment to another person and another
 to do it yourself.‘Queen Margaret is to be taken into the University, not affiliated,
 but made an integral part of the University and the lecturers
 appointed again by the Senators.That means that the Glasgow degrees
 in everything are to be given from October, Arts, Medicine, Science,
 and _Theology_.The “decrees of the primordial protoplasm,” that Sir
 James Crichton-Browne knows all about, are being reversed right and
 left, and not only by the Senatus Academicus of St.Andrews!’

The remaining letters are filled with all the hopes and fears of the
examined.MacEwan tells her she will pass ‘with one hand,’ and
Elsie has the usual moan over a defective memory, and the certainties
that she will be asked all the questions to which she has no answering
key.The evidences of hard and conscientious study abound, and, after
she had counted the days and rejoined her father, she found she had
passed through the heavy ordeal with great success, and, having thus
qualified, could pass on to yet unconquered realms of experience and
service.CHAPTER V

LONDON

THE NEW HOSPITAL FOR WOMEN

DUBLIN

THE ROTUNDA

1892-1894

    ‘We take up the task eternal and the burden and the lesson,
    Pioneers, O Pioneers.’--WALT WHITMAN.After completing her clinical work in Glasgow, and passing the
examination for the Triple Qualification in 1892, it was decided that
Elsie should go to London and work as house-surgeon in the new Hospital
for Women in the Euston Road.In 1916 that hospital kept its jubilee
year, and when Elsie went to work there it had been established for
nearly thirty years.Its story contains the record of the leading names
among women doctors.In the commemorative prayer of Bishop Paget, an
especial thanksgiving was made ‘for the good example of those now at
rest, Elizabeth Blackwell, and Sophia Jex Blake, of good work done
by women doctors throughout the whole world, and now especially of
the high trust and great responsibility committed to women doctors in
this hour of need.’ The hearts of many present went over the washing
seas, to the lands wasted by fire and sword, and to the leader of
the Scottish Women’s Hospitals, who had gained her earliest surgical
experience in the wards of the first hospital founded by the first
woman doctor, and standing for the new principle that women can
practise the healing art.Elsie Inglis took up her work with keen energy and a happy power
of combining work with varied interests.In the active months of
her residence she resolutely ‘tramped’ London, attended most of the
outstanding churches, and was a great sermon taster of ministers
ranging from Boyd Carpenter to Father Maturin.Innumerable relatives
and friends tempted her to lawn tennis and the theatres.She had a keen
eye to all the humours of the staff, and formed her own opinions on
patients and doctors with her usual independence of judgment.Elsie’s letters to her father were detailed and written daily.Only a
very small selection can be quoted, but every one of them is instinct
with a buoyant outlook, and they are full of the joy of service.It is interesting to read in these letters her descriptions of the work
of Dr.Garrett Anderson, and then to read Dr.Louisa Garrett Anderson’s
speech on her mother at the jubilee of the hospital.‘I shall never
forget her at Victoria Station on the day when the Women’s Hospital
Corps was leaving England for France, early in September 1914.She was
quite an old woman, her life’s work done, but the light of battle was
in her eyes, and she said, “Had I been twenty years younger I would
have been taking you myself.” Just twenty-one years before the war
broke down the last of the barriers against women’s work as doctors,
Elsie Inglis entered the New Hospital for Women, to learn with that
staff of women doctors who had achieved so much under conditions so
full of difficulties and discouragements.‘NEW HOSPITAL FOR WOMEN,
      ‘EUSTON RD., 1892-3.‘MY OWN DEAREST PAPA,--Here we begin another long series of letters.The people in the carriage were very quiet, so I slept all right.Of
 course they shut up all the windows, so I opened all the ventilators,
 and I also opened the window two or three times.I had breakfast at
 once, and then a bath, and then came in for a big operation by Mrs.de la
 Cherois were up too--both of them visiting doctors.I have been all
 round the wards and got a sort of idea of the cases in my head, but
 I shall have to get them all up properly.The visiting physicians
 seem to call all over the day, from nine o’clock in the morning till
 three in the afternoon.Some of the students from the School of
 Medicine are dressers and clerks.I believe I have to drill them,
 but of course they are only very senior students, because their real
 hospital is the Royal Free.There are four wards, two of them round,
 with two fireplaces back to back in the middle.The other two wards
 are oblong, and they are all prettily painted, and bright.Then there
 are two small wards for serious cases.I have not arranged my room
 yet, as I have not had a minute.I am going out to post this and get
 a stethescope.de la Cherois has been here; she is a nice old
 lady, and awfully particular.I would much rather work with people
 like that than people who are anyhow.Scharlieb is about forty,
 very dark and solemn.The nurses seem nice, but they don’t have any
 special uniform, which I think is a pity; so they are pinks and greys
 and blues, and twenty different patterns of caps.I think I shall
 like being here very much.I only hope I shall get on with all my
 mistresses!And, I _hope_ I shall always remember what to do.It was very sad, and very
 provoking, for she really was doing well, but she had not vitality
 enough to stand the shock.That was the case whose doctor told her and
 her husband that she was suffering from _hysteria_.And that man, you
 know, can be a fellow of the colleges, and member of any society he
 likes to apply to, while Mrs.G. Anderson said she was going to speak to Mrs.M‘Call about my
 having one of her maternity posts.I shall come home first, however,
 my own dearest Papa.G. A. said she thought I should have a good
 deal more of that kind of work if I was going to set up in a lonely
 place like Edinburgh, as I ought _never_ to have to call in a man to
 help me out of a hole!G. Anderson is going to take me to a Cinderella dance to-night
 in aid of the hospital.M.’s ward, and turned
 up 9.30, Mrs.Then Miss C. came in on the top to consult
 about two of her cases.Into the bargain, A. slept late, and did not
 arrive till near ten, so, by the time they had all left, I had a
 lovely medley of treatment in my head.My fan has arrived, and will
 come in for to-night.G. Anderson will be a nice chaperone
 and introduce one properly.I am to go early, and her son is to look
 out for me, and begin the introducing till she comes.Miss Garrett has
 been to-day painting the hall for the Chicago Exhibition.She is going
 to the dance to-night.Fawcett got some more money out
 of the English Commissioners in a lovely way.These Commissioners have
 spent £17,000 in building themselves a kiosk in the ground, and they
 allowed Mrs.Fawcett £500 to represent women’s work in England.Fawcett has managed to get an
 extra £500.She wrote, and said that if she did not get any more she
 could not mount all the photographs and drawings, but would put up a
 notice that “the English Commission was too poor to allow for mounting
 and framing.” This, with the kiosk in the ground!‘One of the patients here was once upon a time a servant at the
 Baroness Burdett Coutts’.She certainly was most awfully kind to
 her, sent her £10 to pay her rent, and has now paid to send her to
 the Cottage.Miss B. is in hopes she may get her interested in the
 hospital now, but it seems she does not approve of women doctors and
 such things.Perhaps, as the old housemaid did so well here, she may
 change her mind.I shall send them to some of
 the doctors in Edinburgh.Robertson left £1000 in
 memory of his wife to the hospital, and that is how that bed comes to
 be called the “Caroline Croom Robertson bed.”

 ‘We had two big operations to-day.We had the usual round in the
 morning, and then we had to prepare.This
 morning, I pointed out to Mrs.Scharlieb with indignation that our
 galvanic battery had run out.I said that it really was disgraceful
 of C., for it had only been used once for a quarter of an hour since
 the last time he had charged it.S. agreed, and said she would go
 in and speak to him and tell him to send her battery, which was with
 him being charged.We wanted a battery for the galvanic cautery.Scharlieb’s battery arrived.I tried it, and found it would not
 heat the cautery properly.So I was very angry, and I sat down and
 wrote C. a peppery letter.I told him to send some competent person
 _at once_ to look at the battery, and to be prepared to lend us one,
 if this competent person saw it was necessary.M. flew off, and in
 twenty minutes a man from C. arrived, very humble.I turned on the
 batteries, and showed him that they would not heat up properly.Sister
 said I talked to him like a mother.He departed very humbly to bring
 another battery.In about half an hour Sister whistled up, C.’s man
 would like to see me.He looked at me with a twinkle in
 his eye.“You had not taken the resistance off, Miss,” and held one of
 the cautery red-hot attached to our own battery.And the amount of nervous energy I had wasted on
 that battery!‘We began to-day with a big operation.The chloroform was given by a Dr.B., some special friend of the
 patient, so, I hoped there would be no hitch, and there was none.He
 had the cheek afterwards to say to Dr.S., that no one could have done
 it better!S. seemed rather pleased, but I thought it awfully
 patronising, was it not?S. and Miss Walker were talking the other
 morning of the time when they would make this a qualifying hospital?Miss C. said it would certainly come some day, and of course, to make
 it a qualifying hospital, they must have men’s beds, and that will
 mean a mixed staff.Then, we will
 show the old-fashioned hospitals, with their retrograde managers,
 etc., _how_ a mixed staff can work.I wonder if they will have mixed
 classes too!‘I enjoyed _King Lear_ very much.King
 Lear was not a bit kingly, but just a weak, old man.I suppose that
 was what he was meant to be.I shivered in my seat when the wind whistled.The last scene--the French camp on the cliffs on Dover--was really
 beautiful.‘Yesterday, I did a lovely thing--slept like a top till almost nine.I suppose I was tired after the exciting cases.Janet burst into my
 room with “Mrs.S. will be here in a very few minutes, Miss.” So, out
 I tumbled, and tore downstairs to meet Mrs.I tried to
 look as if I had had breakfast _hours_ before, and I don’t think she
 suspected that was my first appearance.She did her visit, and then I
 went to breakfast.G. Anderson chose that
 morning of all others to show a friend of hers round the hospital.She
 marched calmly into the board-room to find me grubbing.I saw the only
 thing to do was to be quite cool, so I got up and shook hands, and
 remarked, “I am rather late this morning,” and she only laughed.It
 was about 10.30, a nice time for an H.S.‘I did not go to hear Father Maturin after all yesterday.I have been
 very busy; we have had another big operation, doing all right so
 far.She is an artist’s wife; she has had an unhappy time for four
 years, because she has been very ill, and their doctor said it was
 hysteria, and told her husband not to give in to the nonsense.Really,
 some of these general practitioners are _grand_.They send some of
 the patients in with the most outrageous diagnoses you can imagine.One woman was told her life was not worth a year’s purchase, and she
 must have a big operation.We pummelled her all over,
 and could not find the grounds of his diagnosis, and finally treated
 for something quite different, and she went out well in six weeks.Her doctor came to see her, and said, “Well, madam, I could not have
 believed it.” It is better they should err in that direction than in
 the direction of calling real illness “hysteria.”

 ‘I mean to have a hospital of my own in Edinburgh some day.‘A patient with a well-balanced nervous system will get well in just
 half the time that one of these hysterical women will.There is one
 plucky little woman in just now.She has had a bad operation, but
 nothing has ever disturbed her equilibrium.She smiles away in the
 pluckiest way, and gets well more quickly than anybody.I agree with
 Kingsley: one of the necessities of the world is to teach girls to be
 brave, and not whine over everything, and the first step for that is
 to teach them to play games!‘Fancy who has been here this evening--Bailie Walcot.He has come
 up to London on Parliamentary business.He investigated every hole
 and corner of the hospital.Littlejohn’s class with Jex’s girls at Surgery Hall.It is wonderful
 how these men who would do nothing at first are beginning to see it
 pays to be neutral now.‘We have a lot to be grateful to J. B. for; Bailie W. told me the
 Leith managers have approached the Edinburgh managers, saying, “If
 you will undertake no more women students, we will undertake to take
 both schools, and to build immediately.” Bailie Walcot said he and Mr.George’s were the _only_ two who opposed this.If they
 send us down to Leith we must make the best of it, and really try to
 make it a good school, but it will be a great pity.G. Anderson is a capital chaperone.I managed to go off without my ticket, and the damsel at the door was
 very severe, and said I must wait till Mrs.I
 waited quietly a minute or two, and was just going to ask her to send
 in to see if Mrs.Anderson had come, then a man marched in, and said
 in a lovely manner, “I have forgotten my ticket,” and she merely said,
 “You must give me your name, sir,” and let him pass.After that I gave
 my name and passed too!I found I might have waited till doomsday, for
 Mrs.I danced every dance; it was a lovely floor and
 lovely music, and you may make up your mind, papa dear, that I go to
 all the balls in Edinburgh after this.They had two odd dances called
 Barn-door.I thought it would be a kind of Sir Roger, but it was the
 oddest kind of hop, skip and dance I ever saw.G. A. it
 was something like a Schottische, only not a quarter so pretty.She
 said it was pretty when nicely danced, but people have not learnt it
 yet.G. A. that I could get some tea from the
 night nurse when I got home (because I wanted to dance the extras),
 but she was horrified at tea just before going to sleep, and swept me
 into the refreshment-room and made me drink soup by the gallon.We had an operation this morning, so you see
 dances don’t interfere with the serious business of life.Scharlieb came in here the other day, and declared I was
 qualifying for acute bronchitis; but I told her nobody could have
 acute bronchitis who had a cold bath every morning, and had been
 brought up to open windows.This is the third sit down to your letter.Talk of women at home never being able to do anything without being
 interrupted every few minutes!I think you have only to be house
 surgeon to know what being interrupted means.They not only knock
 and march in at the door, but they also whistle up the tube--most
 frightfully startling it used to be at first, to hear a sort of shrill
 fog-horn in the room.There are three high temperatures, and the
 results are sent up to me whenever they are taken.We are sponging
 them, and may have to put them into cold baths, but I hope not.G. A. told me to do it without waiting for the chief, if I thought it
 necessary, whereupon Mrs.B. remarked, “I think Miss Inglis ought to
 be warned the patient may die.”

 ‘Lovely weather here.I have been prescribing sunshine, sunshine,
 sunshine for all the patients.There are only two balconies on each
 floor, and nurse Rose is reported to have said that she supposed I
 wanted the patients hung out over the railings, for otherwise there
 would not be room.Miss W. came this morning, to Sister’s indignation.“Does not she think she can trust me for one day?” So I said it was
 only that she was so delighted at having a ward; and that I was sure
 I would do the same.“Oh,” said Sister, “I am thankful you have not a
 ward.You would bring a box with sandwiches and sit there all day.”
 I am always having former H.S.’s thrown at my head who came round
 exactly to the minute, twice a day, whereas they say I am never out
 of the wards, at least they never know when I am coming.I tell them
 I don’t want them to trot round after me with an ink-bottle.Miss R.
 says I have no idea of discipline!I make one grand round a day, with
 the ink-bottle, and then I don’t want the nurses to take any more
 notice of me.I think that is far more sensible than having fixed
 times.I quite agree the ink-bottle round ought to be at a fixed time,
 but I cannot help other things turning up to be done.‘I had to toddle off and ask for Mrs.K. She is the one who is
 appointed to give anæsthetics in the hospital.They are all most
 frightfully nervous about anæsthetics here, in all the hospitals,
 and have regular anæsthetists.In Edinburgh and Glasgow the students
 give it, under the house surgeons of course.I never saw any death,
 or anything that was very frightening.One real reason is, I believe,
 that they watch the wrong organ, viz.Sandra journeyed to the garden.In Scotland they
 hardly think of the heart, and simply watch the breathing.The
 Hydrabad Commission settled conclusively that it was the breathing
 gave out first; but having made up their minds that it does not, all
 the Commissions in the world won’t convince them to the contrary.In the meantime they do their operations in fear and trembling,
 continually asking if the patient is all right.‘You never saw such a splendid out-patient department as they have
 here--a perfectly lovely, comfortable waiting-room, and pretty
 receiving waiting-room.The patients have to pay a small sum, yet they
 had over 20,000 visits this year up to November--that is about half
 the size of the Glasgow Royal, one of the biggest out-patients in the
 kingdom, and general.‘This morning I started off, meaning to go to Dr.Sister C. told me I ought to be early, and of course
 I was as late as I could be.As I was running downstairs Nurse Helen
 asked me if I had ever heard Stopford Brooke.I had heard his name,
 but I could not remember anything about him.Nurse H. said he was an
 awful heretic, and had got into trouble for his opinions.As a general
 rule men who get into trouble for their opinions are worth listening
 to--at least they _have_ opinions.Vaughan, and went off
 to Mr.He gave a capital sermon with nothing heterodox in
 it, about loving our fellow-men.I liked him, and would go to-night to
 hear his lecture on “In Memoriam,” but Sister C. is going out.‘You know you must not aim at a separate but at a mixed school in
 Edinburgh.I am sure this is best, and all the women here think so
 too.G. Anderson asked me to come and help her with a small operation
 in an hotel.She gave me a half-guinea fee for so doing.We drove
 there in a hansom, and drove back in her carriage.She was most jovial
 and talkative.We went into the Deanery, Westminster Abbey, on our way
 back to leave cards on somebody.You suddenly seem to get out of the
 noise and rush of London when you turn in there.All sorts of men were wandering about in red gowns and black
 gowns.Scharlieb was awfully nice and kind.She said she hoped I would
 get on always as well as I had here.I said I
 hoped I would do much better, for I thought I had made an awful lot of
 mistakes since I came here.The worst of being a doctor is that one’s mistakes matter so much.In
 everything else you just throw away what you have messed and begin
 again, but you cannot do that as a doctor.‘She said she expects to be called in as my consultant when I am a
 surgeon.Won’t my patients have to pay fees to get her up from London!‘Miss C. has been trying to get on to some of the medical societies,
 and has failed.I shall not demean myself by asking to get on--shall
 wait till they beseech the honour of adding my name.‘As to women doctors here having an assured position, I rather like
 the pioneer work, I think!I mean to make friends with all the nice
 doctors, and vanquish all the horrid selfish ones, and end by being a
 Missionary Professor.‘If I don’t get into the Infirmary in Edinburgh, I mean to build a
 hospital for myself, like this one.Indeed I don’t know that I should
 not like the hospital to myself better!I’ll build it where the Cattle
 Market is, at the head of Lady Lawson Street.That would be convenient
 for all the women in Fountainbridge, and the Grassmarket and Cowgate,
 and it would be comparatively high.To begin with, I mean to rent
 Eva’s hall from her for a dispensary.You see it is all arranged!’

The next course Elsie decided on taking was one of three months in
Midwifery in the Rotunda, Dublin.There was a greater equality of
teaching there in mixed classes, and also she thought the position of
the whole hospital staff was on lines which would enable her to gain
the most experience in this branch, where she ultimately achieved so
much for her fellow-citizens in Edinburgh.‘COSTIGAN’S HOTEL, UPPER SACKVILLE ST.,
      ‘DUBLIN, _Nov.‘I went over to the Rotunda and saw Dr.I am “clerk” on Mondays and Thursdays.The only other person here is
 a native from the Nizam’s Dominions.At breakfast this morning he
 told me about his children, who are quite fair “like their mother.”
 How fond he was of London, and how he would not live in India now for
 anything; he finds the climate enervating!I told him I thought India
 a first-rate place to live in, and that I should like to go back.‘By the way, fancy the franchise for the Parish Councils being
 carried.The first thing I saw when I landed was defeat of the
 Government!The _Independent_ here is jubilant, partly because the
 point of woman’s suffrage is carried, partly because the Government is
 beaten.‘So the strike has ended, and the men go back to work on their old
 wages till February.I expect both sides are sick of it, but I am glad
 the men have carried it so far.C. evidently thinks I am quite mad, for I have asked for a cold
 bath in my room.it’s not cold entoirely
 ye’ll be meaning.”

 ‘I went to see the D.’s.The first thing I was told was that a
 Miss D. sat in their church, an M.B.A very
 clever girl, she has just taken a travelling bursary and is going to
 Vienna.“But we don’t know her, they are Home Rulers!” Mrs.D. went
 on to say both she and her father were Home Rulers, but that she for
 one would not mind if they did not obtrude their politics.So, I
 thought, “Well, I won’t obtrude mine.” Then Mrs.D. said, “You must
 take a side, you know, and say distinctly what side you are on when
 you are asked.” So I thought, “Well, I’ll wait till I am asked,” and
 I have got through to-day without being asked.But, positively, they
 used the word “boycott” about those D.’s.They have been boycotted
 by the congregation.It must be rather hard to be a Home Ruler and
 a Presbyterian just now in Ireland.Positively, they frightened me
 so, I nearly squirmed under the table.However, when I looked round
 the congregation I thought I should not mind much being boycotted by
 them.D. has
 given me a standing invitation to come to dinner on Sunday.What will
 happen when I am suddenly asked to take my side, I don’t know.In the
 meantime I will let things slide!D. asked me if the Costigans
 were Catholics, and said she thought Mrs.C. looked so nice she could
 not be one.’

      ‘_Dec.1893._

 ‘I have done nothing but race after cases to-day.B., whom she said she had known before he
 was born.B. could not go, so I went.“Hech,” she said, “I came
 for a _doctor_.” “Well, I’m the doctor.Come along.” “Deed no,” she
 said; “ye’re no a doctor--ye’re just a wumman.” I did laugh, and
 marched her off.She was grandly tipsy when I left the home, so I am
 going back to see how the patient has got on, in spite of the nursing.‘I had a second polite speech made to me last night.I was introduced
 into a house by the person who came for me as the doctor.When I
 had been in about two minutes, a small man of four years old, said
 suddenly in a clear voice “That is _not_ a doctor, it’s a girl!” I
 told him he was behind the age not to know that one could be both.‘We had a chloroform scare this morning.S.’s coolness
 immensely.He finished tying his stitches quietly while two doctors
 were skipping round like a pair of frightened girls.They don’t know how to give chloroform anywhere out of
 Scotland.D. declared she was going to write to you that she had found
 I had gone out without my breakfast.I was
 out last night, and was not up when they rang over for me.So, before
 having my breakfast I just ran over to see what they wanted me for,
 and finding it would keep I came back for my breakfast to find Mrs.I am not such an idiot as to miss my meals, Papa, dearest.I always have a glass of milk and a biscuit
 when I go out at night.I know you
 cannot do work with blunt instruments, and this instrument blunts very
 easily without food and exercise.1, 1894._

 ‘I have been round all my patients to-day, and had to drink glasses
 of very questionable wine in each house.It is really very trying to
 a practical teetotaller like me.Literally, I could hardly see them
 when I left the last house!There was simply no getting off it, and I
 did not want to hurt their feelings.When they catch hold of your hand
 and say “Now, doctor dear, or doctor jewel, ye’ll just be takin’ a wee
 glass, deed an ye will,” what are you to do?‘Do you think this “Famasha” with the French in Africa is going to
 be the beginning of the big war?But, it would be the English-speaking
 peoples, Australia, the States, and Canada.‘I have made a convert to the ranks of women’s rights.B. and I had had an awful argument.I never mentioned
 the subject again, for it is no good arguing with a man who has made
 up his mind (and is a North of Ireland man, who will die in the last
 ditch into the bargain).However, in the middle of the operation, he
 suddenly said, “By the way, you are right about the suffrage, Miss
 Inglis.” Then I found he had come over about the whole question.As
 a convert is always the most violent supporter, I hope he’ll do some
 good.5, 1894._

 ‘After three months you have learnt all the Rotunda can teach.If you
 were a man, it would be worth while to stay, because senior students,
 if they are men, get a lot of the C.C.’s work to do.But they never
 think of letting you do it if you are a woman.It is not deliberate
 unfairness, but they never think of it.If one stays six months they
 examine one, and give a degree, L.M., Licentiate of Midwifery.If I
 could I would rather spend three months in Paris with Pozzi.I have
 learnt a tremendous lot here, and feel very happy about my work in
 this special line.If you can
 really afford to give me another three months it would be wiser to go
 to Paris.There are three men who are quite in the front rank there,
 Pozzi, Apostoli, and Péon.’

      ‘COSTIGAN’S, UPPER SACKVILLE STREET,
      ‘DUBLIN, _Feb.10, 1894._

 ‘I got your letter at eleven when I came down to breakfast.I shall
 never get into regular order for home again.No one blames one for
 lying in bed here or being late, for no one knows how late you have
 been up the night before, or how many cases you have been at before
 you get to the lecture.It is partly that, and partly their casual
 Irish ways.I have had a letter from Miss MacGregor this morning,
 asking what I should say to our starting together in Edinburgh.It is quite true, as she says,
 that two women are much more comfortable working together.They can
 give chloroform for one another and so on, and consult together.On
 the other hand, we could do that just as well if we simply started
 separately, and were friends.‘Miss MacGregor was one of the J.-B.lot, and she and I had awful
 rows over that question.But we certainly got on very well before
 that, and, as she says, that was not a personal question.I am quite
 sure Miss MacGregor is Scotch enough not to propose any arrangement
 which won’t be to her own advantage.Probably, I know a good many more
 people than she does.The question for me is whether it will be for my
 advantage.Miss MacGregor is
 a splendid pathologist.Nowadays one ought to do a lot of that work
 with one’s cases, and I have been puzzling over how one could, and yet
 keep aseptic.If we could make some arrangement by which we could work
 into one another’s hands in that way, I think it would be for both our
 advantages.There is one thing in favour of it, if Miss MacGregor and
 I are definitely working together, no one can be astonished at our not
 calling in other people.Miss MacGregor, apart from everything else,
 is distinctly one of our best women, and it would be nice working with
 her.What do you think of it, Papa, dear?Of course I should live at
 home in any case.My consulting rooms anyhow would have to be outside,
 for the old ladies would not climb up the stair!‘DUBLIN, _Feb.‘I do thank you so much for having let me come here.But it was
 awfully good of you to let me come.I am sure it will make a
 difference all my life.I really feel on my feet in this subject now.The more I think of it, the more I think it would be wise to start
 with Miss MacGregor.we will
 start the dispensary, and we’ll end by having a hospital like the
 Rotunda, where students shall live on the premises--female students
 only.Not that these boys are not very nice and good-natured, only
 they are out of place in the Rotunda.’

This was nearly the last letter written by Elsie to her father.In most
of her letters during the preceding months it was obvious Mr.Inglis’
health was causing her anxiety, and the inquiries and suggestions
for his well-being grew more urgent as the shadow of death fell
increasingly dark on the written pages.Elsie returned to receive his eager welcome, but even her eyes were
blinded to the rapidly approaching parting.On the 15th of March 1894,
she wrote to her brother Ernest in India, telling all the story of Mr.Inglis’ passing on the 13th of that month.There was much suffering
borne with quiet patience, ‘He never once complained: I never saw such
a patient.’ At the end, he turned towards the window, and then a bright
look came into his eyes.He said, ‘Pull down the blind.’ Then the
chivalrous, knightly soul passed into the light that never was on sea
or land.‘It was a splendid life he led,’ writes Elsie to her brother; ‘his old
 Indian friends write now and say how “the name of John Inglis always
 represented everything that was upright and straightforward and high
 principled in the character of a Christian gentleman.” He always said
 that he did not believe that death was the stopping place, but that
 one would go on growing and learning through all eternity.We had made such plans, and now it does not seem worth while to go on
 working at all.I said it would be such a joke to see Dr.Saturday afternoons were to be his, and he was to come over
 in my trap.‘He never thought of himself at all.Even when he was very ill at
 the end, he always looked up when one went in, and said, “Well, my
 darling.” I am glad I knew about nursing, for we did not need to have
 any stranger about him.He would have hated that.’




CHAPTER VI

POLITICAL ENFRANCHISEMENT AND NATIONAL POLITICS

    ‘Well done, New Zealand!I expect I shall live to have a vote.’--E.
    M. I., 1891.‘I envy not in any mood
      The captive void of noble rage,
      The linnet born within the cage,
    That never knew the summer woods.’

    ‘So the vote has come!Fancy its having taken the
    war to show them how ready we were to work!Or even to show that
    that work was necessary.Where do they think the world would have
    been without women’s work all these ages?’--E. M. I., Reni, Russia,
    June 1917.David Inglis, writing to his son on his marriage in 1845, says:--

 ‘I cannot express the deep interest, or the ardent hopes with which
 my bosom is filled on the occasion, or the earnest though humble
 prayer to the Giver of all good which it has uttered that He may shed
 abundantly upon you _both_ the rich mercies of His grace: with those
 feelings I take each of you to my heart, and give you my parental
 love and blessing.You have told me enough of the object of your fond
 choice to make her henceforth dear to me, to all of us, on her own
 account, as well as yours.‘And here, my beloved David, I would turn for a moment more
 immediately to yourself, as being now in a situation very different
 from that in which you have hitherto been placed.As a husband, then,
 it will now behove you to remember that you are not your own exclusive
 property--that for a single moment you must never forget; the tender
 love and affectionate respect and consideration which are due from you
 to the amiable individual who has bestowed on you her hand and heart,
 it will, I assure myself, be your pleasing duty to prove, by unceasing
 attention to, and solicitude for, her every wish how dearly you
 appreciate her worth, as well as _gift_; and that her future comfort
 and happiness will invariably possess an estimation in your view
 paramount to every feeling that can more immediately or personally
 affect yourself.Let such be manifest in your every act, as connected
 with every object in which _she_ is concerned.Her love and affection
 for you will then be reciprocal and pure and lasting, and thus will
 you become to each other what, under God’s blessing, you are meant to
 be--a mutual comfort and an abiding stay.Make her the confidential
 friend of your bosom, to whom its every thought must unreservedly
 be imparted--the soother of all its cares, its anxieties, and
 disappointments, when they chance to arise; the fond participator in
 all your happiness and joys, from whatever source they may spring--you
 will thus be discharging a duty which your sacred obligations at the
 altar have entailed upon you.’

This letter has been quoted with its phrasing of seventy years ago,
because it shows an advanced outlook on the position of husband and
wife, and the setting forth of their equality and the respect paid to
their several positions.Inglis’ views, both
in his perfect relations with his wife and the sympathetic liberty of
thought and action which he encouraged in his own family.This chapter is devoted to the political and public life of Elsie
Inglis.The ‘common cause’
to which she gave so much of her life has now been won.The tumult
and the turmoil are now hushed in peace and security.The age which
began in John Stuart Mill’s ‘Subjection of Women’ has ended in the
Representation of the People’s Bill.It is possible to review the
political period of the generation which produced Elsie Inglis, and her
comrades in the struggle against the disqualification of sex, without
raising any fresh controversy.Inglis was one of the finest types of
women produced by the ideals and inspiring purposes of the generation
to which she belonged.She was born when a woman was the reigning
Sovereign, and when her influence and power were at its height.Four years after her birth the Reform Bill of 1868 was to make the
first claim for women as citizens in the British Parliament.The
Married Woman’s Property Act, and the laws affecting Divorce, had
recognised them as something else than the goods and chattels or
the playthings and bondwomen of the ‘predominant partner.’ Mary
Somerville had convinced the world that a woman could have a brain.Timidly, and yet resolutely, women were claiming a higher education,
and Universities were slamming to their doors, with a petty horde
of maxims claimed to be based on divine authority.Women pioneers
mounted platforms and asserted ‘Rights,’ and qualified for jealously
closed professions--always, from the first, upheld and companied by
‘Greathearts,’ men few but chosen, who, like John Inglis, recognised
that no community was the stronger for keeping its people, be they
black or white, male or female, in any form of ignorance or bonded
serfdom.As Elsie grew up, she found herself walking in the new age.Doors
were set ajar, if not fully opened.The first wave of ridicule and of
conscientious objections had spent its force.A girl’s school might
play games decorously and not lose all genteel deportment.Girls might
show a love of knowledge, and no longer be hooted as blue-stockings.The use of the globes and cross-stitch gave place to learning which
might fit them to be educated, and useful members of the community.Ill-health ceased to be considered part of the curse of Eve, to
be borne with swooning resignation on the wide sofas of the early
Victorian Age.Ignorance and innocence were not recognised as twin
sisters, and women, having eaten of the tree of knowledge, looked round
a world which prided itself on giving equal justice to all men, and
discovered that very often that axiom covered a multitude of sins of
injustice against all womankind.It was through Elsie’s professional life that she learnt to know how
often the law was against the woman’s best interests, and it was always
in connection with some reform that she longed to initiate, that she
expressed a desire for the Vote._To her Father_

      ‘GLASGOW, 1891.‘Many thanks for your letter about women’s rights.You are ahead of
 all the world in everything, and they gradually come up into line with
 you--the Westminster Confession and everything except Home Rule!The
 amusing thing about women preaching is that they do it, but as it is
 not in the churches it is not supposed to be in opposition to Paul.They are having lots of meetings in the hall downstairs; every single
 one of them is addressed by a woman.But, of course, they could not
 give the same address in a church and with men listening!At Queen
 Margaret’s here, they are having a course of lectures on the Old
 Testament from the lecturer on that subject in the University, but
 then, of course it is not “Divinity.”’

The opponents to Woman’s Franchise admittedly occupied an illogical
position, and Elsie’s abounding sense of humour never failed to make
use of all the opportunities of laughter which the many absurdities of
the long fight evoked.No one with that sense as highly developed could
ever turn cynical or bitter.It was only when cruelty and injustice
came under her ken that a fine scorn dominated her thought and speech.She gives to her father some of these instances:--

 ‘I got a paper to sign to thank the M.P.’s who voted for Sir A.
 Rollitt’s Woman’s Suffrage Bill.I got it filled up in half a minute.There is no question among women
 who have to work for themselves about wanting the suffrage.It is the
 women who are safe and sound in their own drawing-rooms who don’t see
 what on earth they want it for.A.
 took down her case, and thought she would have to have an operation.Then her husband arrived, and calmly said she was to go home, because
 he could not look after the children.So I said that if she went she
 went on her own responsibility, for I would not give my consent.I said, “Well, take it to a hospital.” Then it
 turned out it was not ill, but had cried last night.I said I saw very
 well what it was, that he had had a bad night, and had just determined
 that his wife should have the bad night to-night, even though she was
 ill, instead of him.He did look ashamed of himself, selfish cad!Helpless creature, he could not even arrange for some one to come in
 and take charge of those children unless his wife went home to do it.She had got some one yesterday, but he had had a row with her.I gave
 him my mind pretty clearly, but I went in just now to find she had
 gone.So one woman said, “It was not ’er fault,
 Miss; ’e would have it.”

 ‘I wonder when married women will learn they have any other duty
 in the world than to obey their husbands.They were not even her
 children--they were step-children.You don’t know what trouble we
 have here with the husbands.They will come in the day before the
 operation, after the woman has been screwed up to it, and worry them
 with all sorts of outside things, and want them home when they are
 half dying.Any idea that anybody is to be thought of but themselves
 never enters their lordly minds, and the worst of it is these stupid
 idiots of women don’t seem to think so either: “’E wants it, Miss,”
 settles the question.I always say--“It does not matter one fig what
 he wants.The question is what you want.” They don’t seem to think
 they have any right to any individual existence.Well, I feel better
 now, but I wish I could have scragged that beast.I have to go to the
 wards now!‘We had another row with a tyrannical husband.I did not know whether
 to be most angry with him or his fool of a wife.Daniel journeyed to the garden.She had one of the
 most painful things anybody can have, an abscess in her breast.It was
 so bad Miss Webb would not do anything for it in the out-patients’,
 but said she was to come in at once.The woman said she would go and
 arrange for somebody to look after her baby and come back at six.“_I_ cannot let my wife come in,
 as the baby is not old enough to be left with anybody else.” Did you
 ever hear anything so monstrous?That one human being is to settle
 for another human being whether she is to be cured or not.I asked
 him whether he knew how painful it was, and if he had to bear the
 pain.Miss Webb appealed to him, that he _was_ responsible for his
 wife’s health, for he seemed to assume he was not.Both grounds were
 far above his intellect, either his responsibility or his wife’s
 rights.He just stood there like an obstinate mule.We told him it
 was positively brutal, and that he was to go _at once_ and get a good
 doctor home with him if he would not let her in.‘What a fool the woman must have been to have educated him up to that.There really was no necessity for her to stay out because he said she
 was to--poor thing.Miss Webb and I have struck up a great friendship
 as the result.After we had both fumed about for some time, I said,
 “Well, the only way to educate that kind of man, or that kind of
 woman, is to get the franchise.” Miss Webb said, “Bravo, bravo,” then
 I found she was a great franchise woman, and has been having terrible
 difficulties with her L.W.A.here.’

The writer may add one more to these instances.Suffrage meetings
were of a necessity much alike, and the round of argument was much
the same.Spade-work had to be done among men and women who had the
mental outlook of these patients and the overlords of their destiny.Meetings were rarely enthusiastic or crowded, and it was often like
speaking into the heart of a pincushion.Inglis came by train straight from her practice.In memory’s halls all
meetings are alike, but one stands out, where Dr.Inglis illustrated
her argument by a fact in her day’s experience.The law does not permit
an operation on a married woman without her husband’s consent.That day
the consent had been refused, and the woman was to be left to lingering
suffering from which only death could release her.The voice and the
thrill which pervaded speaker and audience as Dr.Inglis told the tale
and pointed the moral, remains an abiding memory.Her politics were Liberal, and, what was more remarkable, she was
a convinced Home Ruler.Those who believe that women in politics
naturally take the line of the home, may find here a very strong
instance of the independent mind, producing no rift within the lute
that sounded such a perfect note of unison between her and the
prevailing influence of her youth.Inglis had done his work in
India, and his politics were of an Imperialist rather than that of a
‘Home Ruler All Round.’ When Mr.Gladstone introduced his Home Rule
Bill of 1893, Elsie complains of the obstructive talk in Parliament.Inglis gently says she seems to wish it passed without discussion.Elsie replies on the points she thinks salient and likely to work, and
wonders why they should not commend themselves to sense and not words.The family have recollections of long and not acrimonious debates well
sustained on either side.She was a member of the W.L.F., and was always impatient of the way
Party was placed before the Franchise.‘I was sorry to see how the Suffrage question was pushed into the
 background by Lady Aberdeen.However, I shall stick to the Federation,
 and bring them to their senses on that point as far as my influence
 goes.It is simply sham Liberalism that will not recognise that it is
 a real Liberal question (1893).‘That is a capital letter of Miss M‘Laren’s.It is quite true, and
 women are awful fools to truckle to their party, instead of putting
 their foot down, about the Franchise.You would certainly hear more
 about wife murders than you do at present, if the women had a vote.‘Do you know what they said at the Liberal Club the other day in
 answer to some deputation, or appeal, or rather it was said, in the
 discussion, that the Liberal Party would do all they could to remedy
 abuses and give women justice, but the vote they would not give,
 because they would put a power into women’s hand which could never be
 taken away.‘Did I tell you that I have to speak at a drawing-room meeting on
 Woman’s Suffrage?I had just refused to write
 a paper for her on the present state of medical education in the
 country, for I thought that would be too great cheek in a house
 surgeon, so I did not like to refuse the other.‘The drawing-room meeting yesterday was very good.I got there late,
 and found a fearfully and awfully fashionable audience being harangued
 by a very smart-looking man, who spoke uncommonly well, and was saying
 everything I meant to say.Elmy smiled and nodded away to me, and suddenly it flashed on
 me that I was to second the motion this man was speaking to.I was
 in such an awful funk that I got cool, and got up and told them that
 I did not think Mr.Wilkins had left any single thing for me to say;
 however, as things struck people in different ways I should simply
 tell them how it struck me, and then went ahead with what I meant to
 say when I got in.Elmy was quite pleased, and several people
 came up afterwards, and said I had got on all right.Elmy said,
 I had not repeated Mr.He was such a fluent
 speaker, he scared me awfully.’

The decade that saw the controversy of Home Rule for Ireland, was the
first that brought women prominently into political organisations.Many
women’s associations were formed, and the religious aspect as between
Ulster and the South interested many very deeply.Elsie was not a
Liberal-Unionist, and, as she states her case to her father, there is
much that shows that she was thinking the matter out for herself, on
lines which were then fresher than they are to-day.From Glasgow, in 1891, she writes:--

 ‘I have spent a wicked Sunday.I read all the morning, and then went
 up to the Infirmary to bandage with Dr.T. says I am quite
 sure to be plucked, after such worldliness.I have discovered he is
 an Australian from Victoria.D. is an Aberdeen man and a great
 admirer of George Smith.Never mind about
 the agricultural labourer, Papa dear!I am afraid Gladstone’s majority
 won’t be a working one, and we shall have the whole row over again in
 six months.D. says every available voter has been seized by the
 scruff of his neck and made to vote this time.And, six months hence
 there’ll be no fresh light on the situation, and we’ll be where we
 are now.I should not wonder if the whole thing makes us devise some
 plan for one Imperial Parliament and local government for Ireland,
 Scotland, and the Colonies, ending in making the integrity of the
 Empire “and unity of the English speaking race” more apparent than it
 is now, _and_ with the Irish contented and managing their own affairs
 in their own mad way.Gladstone has been so engrossed with his H.R.measure that he
 does not seem to have noticed these other questions that have been
 quickly growing, and he has made two big blunders about Woman’s
 Suffrage and the Labour question.I have no doubt these men are
 talking a lot of nonsense, and are trying for impossibilities, but
 there is a great deal of sense in what they say.It is no good
 shutting our eyes to the facts they bring forward.D., I am very much afraid you would not agree with him.The only point in which he agrees with you is
 that he would make everybody do what he thinks right.Only his ideas
 of right are very different from yours.He believes in an eight-hour
 day, local option, and State-owned mines.His chief amusement at
 present is arguing with me.He generally gets angry, and says, “I
 argue like a woman,” but he always pluckily begins again.He was a
 tradesman, and gave it up because he says you cannot be an honest
 tradesman nowadays.He is studying medicine; the last day I worked
 at “brains” he rampaged about the room arguing about the unearned
 increment.I tell him he must come and argue in Edinburgh--I have not
 time at present.‘I will tell you what I think of the Home Rule Bill to-morrow--that is
 to say, if I have time to read it.It is really a case of officers and
 men here just now.I can’t say “go on” instead of “come on.” I cannot
 order cold spongings and hot fomentations by the dozen and then sit in
 my room and read the newspapers, can I?’

      ‘GLASGOW, _May 1892_.‘What do you think of Lord Salisbury’s speech, inciting to rebellion
 and civil war?Now, don’t think of it as Lord Salisbury and Ulster,
 but think of it as advice given by Mr.Gladstone to the rest of
 Ireland.If you like to take the lead into your own hands and march on
 Dublin; I don’t know that any Government would care to use the forces
 of the Crown against you.You will be quite justified because the
 Government of your country is in the hands of your hereditary foes.There is only one good point in Lord Salisbury’s speech, and that is
 that he does not sham that the Ulster men are Irishmen.He calls them
 a colony from this country.Lord S. must have been feeling desperate
 before he made that speech.’

      ‘_1894_.Chamberlain’s speech was very clever.It was this special
 Home Rule Bill he pulled to pieces, and one could not help feeling
 that that would have been the result whatever the Bill had been, if
 it had been introduced by anybody but Mr.C. His argument seemed to
 be in favour of Imperial Federation, as far as I could make out.I
 have no doubt the Bill can be very much improved in committee, but
 the groundwork of it is all right.The two Houses and the gradual
 giving over of the police and land, when they have had time to find
 their feet.As to the retaining the Irish members in Parliament being
 totally illogical, there is nothing in that; we always make illogical
 things work.I expect he hates the
 Irish Party as much as any man, but he spoke up for them all the
 same.If he had not, I don’t believe Mr.Chamberlain and some of the
 others would have spoken as they did.The Conservative Party was quite
 inclined to laugh at the paid stipendiaries until Mr.‘I have been reading up the Bishop of Chester’s scheme and the Direct
 Veto Bill.It would be very nice to turn
 all the pubs into coffee-houses, but a big company over whom the
 ratepayers have no control would be just as likely to do what would
 pay best, as the tramway companies now, who work their men seventeen
 hours and their horses three, at a stretch.It would be quite a
 different thing to put the pubs under the Town and County Councils.As
 to this Bill it is not to stop people drinking, but simply to shut up
 pubs.A man can still buy his whisky and get drunk in his own house,
 but a community says, “We won’t have the nuisance of a pub at every
 corner,” and I am not sure that they have not that right, just as much
 as the private individual has to get drunk if he chooses.A great
 many men would keep straight if the temptation were not thrown in
 their faces.The system of licences was instituted for the good of the
 public, not the good of the publican.‘The Elections will be three weeks after my exam.Dearest Papa!--There
 is as much chance of Mr.Gladstone being beaten in Midlothian as there
 is of a Conservative majority.’

Another friend writes:--

 ‘I should like to send you a recollection of her in the early
 Nineties.Jessie MacGregor, wrote to my home in
 Rothesay, asking us to put up Dr.Inglis, who was to give an address
 at a Sanitary Congress to be held there.It was, I believe, her first
 public appearance, and she did do well.One woman alone on a platform
 filled with well-known doctors from all parts!Her subject was
 advocating women as sanitary inspectors.She was one of the pioneers
 in that movement also.I can well remember her, a slim little girl in
 black, fearless as ever, doing her part.After she had finished, there
 was a running criticism of her subject.Many against her view, few for
 the cause on which she was speaking.One well-known doctor asked us to picture
 his dear friend Elsie Inglis carrying out a six-foot smallpox patient.‘I think she was the first lady medical to speak at a Congress.It was
 such a pleasure to entertain her, she was so quiet and unobtrusive,
 and yet so humorous.I never met her again, but I could never forget
 her, though we were just like ships that pass in the night.’

One of her Suffrage organisers, Miss Bury, gives a vivid picture of her
work in the Suffrage cause:--

 ‘It was Dr.Elsie Inglis who brought me to Scotland, and sent me to
 organise Suffrage societies in the Highlands.I speak of her as I knew
 her, the best of chiefs, so kind and encouraging and appreciative of
 one’s efforts, even when they were not always crowned with success.I remember saying I was disappointed because the hall was only about
 three-quarters full, and her reply was, “My dear, I was not counting
 the people, I was thinking of the efforts which had brought those who
 were there.”

 ‘Her letters were an inspiration.She gave one the full responsibility
 of one’s position, and always expected the best.Resolutely direct,
 and straightforward in her dealings with me as a subordinate worker,
 she never failed to tell me of any word of appreciation that reached
 her, as she also told me candidly if she heard of any criticism.She had such a big, generous mind, even condescending to give an
 opportunity for argument when there was any difference of opinion, and
 absolutely tolerant and kind when one did not agree with her.‘She was always considerate of one’s health, and insisted that the
 hours laid down for work were not to be exceeded, or, if this was
 unavoidable, that the time must be taken off as soon as possible
 afterwards.She only saw difficulties to conquer them, and I well
 remember in one of her letters from Lazaravatz, she wrote so
 characteristically--“the work is most interesting, bristling with
 difficulties.”

 ‘My happiest recollection is of a visit to the Highlands, to speak at
 some Suffrage meetings I had arranged for her.In the train she was
 always busy writing, in that beautiful clear characteristic hand, like
 herself, triumphing over the jolting of the Highland Railway, as she
 did later in Serbia.In the early morning she had to catch a train at
 Inverness, and we went by motor from Nairn.For once the writing was
 laid aside, and she gave herself up to the enjoyment of the sunrise,
 and the beautiful lights on the Ross-shire hills, as we travelled
 along the shores of the Moray Firth.When the car broke down, out came
 the despatch case again, while the chauffeur and I put on the Stepney.There was no complaining about the lost train, a wire was sent to the
 committee apologising for her absence, and then she immediately turned
 her attention to other business.’

One who first came under her influence as a patient, and became a warm
friend, gives some reminiscences.Her greeting to the elect at the
beginning of the year was, ‘A good new year, and the Vote _this_ year.’

 ‘I remember once, as we descended the steps of St.Giles’ after
 attending a service at which the Edinburgh Town Council was present,
 she spoke joyfully of the time coming when we, the women of Edinburgh
 and of Scotland, would “help to build the New Jerusalem, with the
 weapon ready to our hand--the Vote.”’

The year 1906 brought the Liberals into political power, and with
the great wave of democratic enthusiasm which gave the Government of
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman an enormous majority there came other
expressions of the people’s will.The Franchise for women had hitherto been of academic interest in the
community: a crank, many thought it, like total abstinence or Christian
Science.The claims of women were frequently brought before Parliament
by private members, and if the Bill was not ‘talked out,’ it was talked
round, as one of the best jests of a Parliamentary holiday.The women
who advocated it were treated with tolerance, their public advocacy
was deemed a _tour de force_, and their portraits were always of the
nature of caricatures, except those in _Punch_, where the opponent was
caricatured, and the women immortalised.The Liberal party found its right wing mainly composed of Labour, and
Socialist members were returned to Parliament.From that section of
thought sprang the militant movement, and the whole question of the
enfranchisement of women took on a different aspect.This chapter does not attempt to give a history of the ‘common cause,’
or the reasons for the rapid way it came to the front, and ranked with
Ireland as among the questions which, left unsettled, became a thorn in
the side of any Government that attempted to govern against, or leaving
outside the expressed will of the people.This is no place to examine the causes which, along with the militant
movement, but always separated from them, poured such fresh life and
vigour into the old constitutional and law-abiding effort to procure
the free rights of citizenship for women.The pace quickened to an extent which was bewildering.Where a dozen
meetings a year had been the portion of many speakers, they were
multiplied by the tens and scores.A
fighting fund collected, meetings arranged, debates were held all over
the country and among all classes.A press, which had never written up
the subject while its advocates were law-abiding, tumbled over each
other to advertise every movement of all sections of suffragists.It must be admitted the militants gave them plenty of copy, and the
constitutionalists had an uneasy sense that their stable companions
would kick over the traces in some embarrassing and unexpected way on
every new occasion.Still the tide flowed steadily for the principle,
and those who had its guidance in Parliament and the country had to
use all the strength of the movement in getting it well organised and
carefully worked.Societies were federated, and the greatly growing
numbers co-ordinated into a machine which could bring the best pressure
to bear on Parliament.The well-planned Federation of Scottish
Suffrage Societies owed much to Dr.Inglis’ gift of organisation and
of taking opportunity by the hand.She was Honorary Secretary to the
Scottish Federation, and in those fighting years between 1906 and
1914 she impressed herself much on its policy.In the early years of
her professional life, she used gaily to forecast for herself a large
and paying practice.Her patients never suffered, but she sacrificed
her professional prospects in a large measure for her work for the
Franchise.She gave her time freely, and she raised money at critical
times by parting with what was of value and in her power to give.Perhaps, the writer may here again give her own reminiscences.Inglis was all too rarely social; they met almost
entirely in their suffrage work.Inglis at all was to know
her well.The transparent sincerity and simplicity of her manner left
nothing to be discovered.One felt instinctively she was a comrade
one could ‘go tiger-hunting with,’ and to be in her company was to be
sustained by a true helpmate.Invited
by the elect, and sometimes by the opponents to enjoy hospitality, Dr.Inglis was rarely able to come in time for the baked meats before we
ascended the platform, and uttered our platitudes to rooms often empty
woodyards, stuck about with a remnant of those who would be saved.She
usually met us on the platform, having arrived by the last train, and
obliged to leave by the first.There was always the smile at the last set-back, the ready joke at our
opponents, the subtle sense that she was out to win, the compelling
force of sustained effort that made at least one of her yoke-fellows
ashamed of the faint heart that could never hope to win through.Sometimes we travelled back together; more often we would meet next day
in St.Giles’ after the daily service, and our walk home was always
a cheer.‘Never mind’ the note to discouragement.‘Remember this or
that in our favour; our next move must be in this direction.’ And the
thought was always there (if her unselfconsciousness prevented it being
spoken--as one wishes to-day it had been)--‘The meeting went, because
you were there and set your whole soul on “willing” it through.’

She had no sympathy with militantism.There was no better fighter
with legitimate weapons, but she saw how closely the claim to do wrong
that good might come was related to anarchy, and her sense of true
citizenship was outraged by law-breaking which, to her clear judgment,
could only <DW44> the ultimate triumph of a cause rooted in all that
was just and righteous.She was not confused by any cross-currents
of admiration for individual courage and self-sacrifice, and her one
desire was to see that the Federation was ‘purged’ of all those who
belonged to the forces of disintegration.She had the fruit of her political sagacity, and her fearless pursuit
after integrity in deed and in word.When the moment came when she was
to go to the battle fronts of the world, a succourer of many, she went
in the strength of the Suffrage women of Scotland.They were her shield
and buckler, and their loyal support of her work and its ideals was
her exceeding great reward.Without their organised strength she could
never have called into existence those units and their equipment which
have justly earned the praises of nations allied in arms.With the rise of the militant movement, the whole Suffrage cause
passed through a cloud of opprobrium and almost universal objurgation.Women were all tarred with the same stick, and fell under one
condemnation.It is now of little moment to recall this, except in as
much as it affected Elsie Inglis.The Scottish Suffrage societies, who
gave their organisation and their workers to start the Scottish Women’s
Hospitals, found that the community desired to forget the unpopular
Suffrage, and to remember only the Scottish Hospitals.Inglis was doing were asked to avoid ‘the common cause.’
No one who knew her would consent to deny by implication one of the
deepest mainsprings of her work.The Churches were equally timid in
aught that gave comfort or consolation to those who were loyal to their
Christian social ideal for women.No organised society owes more to the
administrative work of women than does the Christian Church throughout
the world.No body of administrators have been slower to perceive that
women in responsible positions would be a strength to the Church than
have been the clergy of the Church.The writer of _Uncle Tom’s Cabin_
puts into the mouth of the clerical type of that day the argument
that the Old Testament gave an historic basis for the enslavement of
races, and St.The
spirit of Christianity has raised women from a ‘low estate,’ and women
owe everything to the results of Christianity; but the ecclesiastical
mind has never shaken off the belief that they are under a special
curse from the days of Eden, and that St.Paul’s outlook on women
in his day was the last revelation as to their future position in a
jealously-guarded corporation.Which of us, acquainted with the Church
history of our day, but remembers the General Assembly when the women
missionaries were first invited to stand by their fellow-workers and be
addressed by the Moderator on their labours and sufferings in a common
cause?It was a great shock to the fathers and brethren that their sex
should not disqualify them from standing in the Assembly, which would
have more democratic weight in the visible Church on earth if some of
its elected lay members were women serving in the courts of the Church.In this matter and in many others concerning women, the Church is not
yet triumphant over its prejudices bedded in the geological structure
of Genesis.In all periods of the enfranchisement struggle there were individual
clergy who aided women with their warm advocacy and the helpful
direction of thought.Elsie Inglis was a leader of this movement in its
connection with a high Christian ideal of the citizenship of women.Margaret’s, the church of Parliament in
history, to commemorate all her works begun and ended as a member of
Christ’s Church here on earth, it was fitting that Bishop Gore, who had
so consistently upheld the cause, should speak of her work as one who
had helped to win the equality of women in a democratic, self-governing
State.This memoir would utterly fail to reproduce a picture of Dr.Inglis if
it did not emphasise how her spirit was led and disciplined, tempered
and steeled, through this long and fiery trial to the goal of a leading
ideal.The contest trained her for her splendid achievements in
overcoming all obstacles in ministering to the sufferings of nations,
‘rightly struggling to be free.’ Her friend, Miss Wright, says:--

 ‘We did not always agree.Many were the arguments we had with her, but
 she was always willing to understand another point of view and willing
 to allow for difference of opinion.She was very fair-minded and
 reasonable, and deplored the excesses of the militant suffragettes.She was in no sense a man-hater; to her the world was composed of men
 and women, and she thought it a mistake to exalt the one unduly over
 the other.She was never embittered by her struggle for the position
 of women.She loved the fight, and the endeavour, and to arrive at any
 point just meant a fresh setting forward to another further goal.‘From her girlhood onward, her effort was to free and broaden life for
 other women, to make the world a better place to live in.‘I had a letter this week from Annie Wilson, Elsie’s great friend.She says, “It seems to me Elsie’s whole life was full of championship
 of the weak, and she was so strong in maintaining what was right.I remember once saying in connection
 with some work I was going to begin, ‘I wonder if I shall be able,’
 and Elsie saying in her bright way, ‘What man has done man can do.’
 I am so glad that she had the opportunity of showing her great
 administrative capacity, and that her power is known and acknowledged.I cannot tell you what it will be not to have
 her welcome to look forward to when I come home.”

 ‘Elsie had in many respects what is, perhaps wrongly, called a man’s
 mind.She was an Imperialist in the very best sense, and had high
 ideals for her country and people.She was a very womanly woman,
 never affecting mannish ways as a pose.If she seemed a strong-minded
 woman it was because she had strenuous work to do.She was never “a
 lone woman.” She was always one of a family, and in the heart of the
 family.Elsie always had the _lovingest_ appreciation and backing from
 her nearest and dearest, and that a wide and varied circle.So, also,
 she did not need to fight for her position; it has been said of her,
 “Whenever she began to speak her pleasant well-bred accent and manner
 gained her a hearing.” She was ever a fighter, but it was because she
 wanted those out in the cold and darkness to come into the love and
 light which she herself experienced and sought after always more fully.‘We looked forward to more frequent meetings when working days were
 done.Now she has gone forward to the great work beyond:

    ‘“Somewhere, surely, afar
    In the sounding labour home vast
    Of being, is practised that strength--
    Zealous, beneficent, firm.”’




CHAPTER VII

THE PROFESSION AND THE FAITH

    ‘Run the straight race through God’s good grace,
    Lift up thine eyes and seek His face;
    Life with its way before us lies,
    Christ is the path, and Christ the prize.’

    ‘Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.’


Elsie Inglis took up practice in Edinburgh, and worked in a happy
partnership with the late Dr.Jessie MacGregor, until the latter left
Scotland for work in America.When the University of Edinburgh admitted women to the examinations for
degrees in medicine, Dr.Inglis graduated M.B., C.M.From that
date onwards her practice, her political and suffrage work, and the
founding of the Hospice in the High Street of Edinburgh, as a nursing
home and maternity centre staffed by medical women, occupied a life
which grew and strengthened amid so many and varied experiences.Her father’s death deprived her of what had been the very centre and
mainspring of her existence.As she records the story of his passing
on, she says that she cannot imagine life without him, and that he had
been so glad to see her begin her professional career.She was not one
to lose her place in the stream of life from any morbid inaction or
useless repining.She shared the spirit of the race from which she had
sprung, a reaching forward to obtain the prize of life fulfilled with
service, and she had inherited the childlike faith and confidence which
inspired their belief in the Father of Spirits.Elsie lost in her father the one who had made her the centre of his
thoughts and of his most loving watchfulness.From the day that her
home with him was left unto her desolate, she was to become a centre to
many of her father’s wide household, and, even as she had learnt from
him, she became a stay and support to many of his children’s children.The two doctors started practice in Atholl Place, and later on they
moved into 8 Walker Street, an abode which will always be associated
with the name of Dr.M‘Laren says:--

 ‘My impressions of their joint house are all pleasant ones.They got
 on wonderfully together, and in every thing seemed to appreciate one
 another’s good qualities.They were very different, and had in many
 ways a different outlook.I remember Jessie saying once, “Elsie is so
 exceptionally generous in her attitude of mind, it would be difficult
 not to get on with her!” They both held their own opinions on various
 subjects without the difference of opinion really coming between them.Elsie said once about the arrangement, “It has all the advantages of
 marriage without any of its disabilities.” We used always to think
 they did each other worlds of good.I know how I always enjoyed a
 visit to them if it was only for an afternoon or some weeks.There was
 such an air of freedom in the whole house.You did what you liked,
 thought what you liked, without any fear of criticism or of being
 misunderstood.‘I do not know much about her practice, as medicine never interested
 me, but I believe at one time, before the Suffrage work engrossed her
 so much, she was making quite a large income.’

Professionally she suffered under two disabilities: the restricted
opportunities for clinical work in the days when she was studying her
profession, combined with the constant interruptions which the struggle
against the medical obstructionists necessitated; secondly, the
various stages in the political fight incident to obtaining that wider
enfranchisement which aimed at freeing women from all those lesser
disabilities which made them the helots of every recognised profession
and industry.When in the Scottish Women’s Hospitals abroad, Dr.Inglis rapidly
acquired a surgical skill, under the tremendous pressure of work, which
often kept her for days at the operating-table, which showed what a
great surgeon she might have been, given equal advantages in the days
of her peace practice.Inglis lost no opportunity of enlarging her knowledge.She was
a lecturer on Gynecology in the Medical College for Women which had
been started later than Dr.Jex Blake’s school, and was on slightly
broader lines.After she had started practice she went to study German
clinics; she travelled to Vienna, and later on spent two months in
America studying the work and methods of the best surgeons in New York,
Chicago, and Rochester.She advocated, at home and abroad, equal opportunities for work
and study in the laboratories for both men and women students.She
maintained that the lectures for women only were not as good as those
provided for the men, and that the women did not get the opportunity
of thorough laboratory practice before taking their exams.She thus
came into conflict with the University authorities, who refused to
accept women medical students within the University, or to recognise
extra-mural mixed classes in certain subjects.‘With a great price’ she might truly say
she had purchased her freedom, and nothing would turn her aside.If
one avenue was closed, try another.If one Principal was adamant,
his day could not last for ever; prepare the way for his successor.Indomitable, unbeaten, unsoured, Dr.Inglis, with the smiling, fearless
brow, trod the years till the influence of the ‘red planet Mars’ opened
to her and others the gate of opportunity.She had achieved many
things, and was far away from her city and its hard-earned practice
when at length, in 1916, the University, under a new ‘open-minded,
generous-hearted Head,’ opened its doors to women medical students.There were other things, besides her practice, which Dr.Inglis
subordinated in these years to the political enfranchisement of women.It has been shown in a previous chapter how keen were her political
beliefs.She joined the Central Edinburgh Women’s Liberal Association
in its earliest organised years.She acted as Vice-President in it for
sixteen years, and was one of its most active members.Gulland, the Liberal Whip, knew the value of her work, and must
have had reason to respect the order in which she placed her political
creed--first the citizenship of women, then the party organisation.He speaks of her fearless partisanship and aloof attitude towards all
local political difficulties.An obstacle to her was a thing to be
overcome, not to be sat down before.Any one in politics who sees what
is right, and cannot understand any reason why the action should not
be straight, rather than compromising, is a help to party agents at
rare intervals; normally such minds cause anxiety.Her secretary, Miss
Cunningham, says about her place in the Liberal organisation:--

 ‘Not only as a speaker--though as that she was invaluable--but as one
 who mixed freely with all our members, with her sympathy, in fact, her
 enthusiasm for everything affecting the good of women, she won respect
 and liking on every side.It was not until she became convinced that
 she could help forward the great cause for women better by being
 unattached to any party organisation that she severed her connection
 with the Liberal Party.Regretted as that severance was by all, we
 understood her point of view so well that we recognised there was no
 other course open to her.Her firm grasp of and clear insight into
 matters political made her a most valued colleague, especially in
 times of difficulty, when her advice was always to be relied upon.’

In 1901 she was a member of the Women’s Liberal League, a branch of
the W.L.A.which split off at the time of the Boer War, in opposition
to the ‘Little Englanders.’ Dr.Inglis was on its first committee, and
lent her drawing-room for meetings, addressing other meetings on the
Imperialist doctrines born in that war.When that phase of politics
ended, the League became an educational body and worked on social and
factory legislation.Among her other enterprises was the founding of the Muir Hall of
Residence for Women Students at the University.Many came up from the
country, and, like herself in former days in Glasgow, had to find
suitable, and in many cases uncomfortable, lodgings.Principal Muir’s old Indian friendship with Mr.Inglis had been most
helpful in former years, and now Lady Muir and other friends of the
women students started a Residence in George Square for them, and
Miss Robertson was appointed its first warden.Secretary to the Muir Hall till she died, and from its start was a
moving spirit in all that stood for the comfort of the students.She
attended them when they were ill, and was always ready to help them
in their difficulties with her keen, understanding advice.The child
of her love, amid all other works, was her Maternity Hospice.Of this
work Miss Mair, who was indeed ‘a nursing mother’ to so many of the
undertakings of women in the healing profession, writes of Dr.Inglis’
feeling with perfect understanding:--

 ‘To Dr.Inglis’ clear vision, even in her early years of student life,
 there shone through the mists of opposition and misunderstandings a
 future scene in which a welcome recognition would be made of women’s
 services for humanity, and with a strong, glad heart she joined with
 other pioneers in treading “the stony way” that leads to most reforms.Once landed on the firm rock of professional recognition, Dr.Inglis
 set about the philanthropic task of bringing succour and helpful
 advice to mothers and young babies and expectant mothers in the
 crowded homes in and about the High Street.There, with the help of a
 few friends, she founded the useful little Hospice that we trust now
 to see so developed and extended by an appreciative public, that it
 will merit the honoured name “The Dr.Elsie Inglis Memorial Hospice.”

 ‘This little Hospice lay very near the heart of its founder--she loved
 it--and with her always sensitive realisation of the needs of the
 future, she was convinced that this was a bit of work on the right
 lines for recognition in years to come.Some of us can recall the
 kindling eye, the inspiring tones, that gave animation to her whole
 being when talking of her loved Hospice.She saw in it a possible
 future that might effect much, not only for its patients, but for
 generations of medical women.’

With Dr.Elsie one idea always started another, and ‘a felt want’ in
any department of life always meant an instantly conceived scheme of
supplying the need.Those who ‘came after’ sometimes felt a breathless
wonder how ways and means could be found to establish and settle the
new idea which had been evolved from the fertile brain.The Hospice
grew out of the establishment of a nursing home for working women,
where they could be cared for near their own homes.Barbour, a house was secured at a nominal rent in
George Square, and opened in 1901.That sphere of usefulness could be
extended if a maternity home could be started in a poorer district.Thus the Hospice in the High Street was opened in 1904.Inglis
devoted herself to the work.An operating theatre and eight beds
were provided.The midwifery department grew so rapidly that after a
few years the Hospice became a centre, one of five in Scotland, for
training nurses for the C.M.B.Inglis looked forward to a greater future for it in infant welfare
work, and she always justified the device of the site as being close
to where the people lived, and in air to which they were accustomed.Trained district nurses visited the people in their own homes, and
in 1910 there were more cases than nurses to overtake them.In that
year the Hospice was amalgamated with Bruntsfield Hospital; medical,
surgical, and gynecological cases were treated there, while the Hospice
was devoted entirely to maternity and infant welfare cases.Inglis’ ‘vision’ was nearly accomplished when she had a small ward
of five beds for malnutrition cases, a baby clinic, a milk depot,
health centres, and the knowledge that the Hospice has the distinction
of being the only maternity centre run by women in Scotland.This
affords women students opportunities denied to them in other maternity
hospitals.A probationer in that Hospice says:--

 ‘Dr.Inglis’ idea was that everything, as far as possible, should
 be made subservient to the comfort of the patients.This was always
 considered when planning the routine.She disapproved of the system
 prevalent in so many hospitals of rousing the patients out of sleep
 in the small hours of the morning in order to get through the work of
 the wards.She would not have them awakened before 6 A.M., and she
 instituted a cup of tea before anything else was done.To her nurses
 she was very just and appreciative of good work, and, if complaints
 were made against any one, the wrongdoing had to be absolutely proved
 before she would take action.She also insisted on the nurses having
 adequate time off, and that it should not be infringed upon.’

These, in outline, are the interests which filled the years after Dr.Of her work among the people living round
her Hospice, it is best told in the words of those who watched for
her coming, and blessed the sound of her feet on their thresholds.Freely she gave them of her best, and freely they gave her the love and
confidence of their loyal hearts.Inglis’ patient for twenty years, and she had
also attended her mother and grandmother.Of several children one
was called Elsie Maud Inglis, and the child was christened in the
Dean Church by Dr.The whole family seem to have been her charge, for when Mrs.B.’s husband returned from the South African War, Dr.Inglis fought
the War Office for nine months to secure him a set of teeth, and,
needless to say, after taking all the trouble entailed by a War Office
correspondence, she was successful.A son fought in the present war,
and when Dr.Inglis saw the death of a Private B., she sent a telegram
to the War Office to make sure it was not the son of Mrs.B. She would
never take any fees from this family.B. gave her
some feathers he had brought home from Africa.She had them put in a
new hat she had got for a wedding, and came round before she went to
the festival to show them to the donor.Her cheery ways ‘helped them
all,’ and when a child of the family broke its leg, and was not mending
all round in the Infirmary, Dr.Inglis was asked to go and see her, and
the child from then ‘went forrit.’

In another family there was some stomach weakness, and three infants
died.Inglis tried hard to save the life of the third, a little
boy, who was evidently getting no nourishment.So anxious was she,
that she asked a sister who had recently had a baby, to try if she
could nurse the child.This was done, the foster mother going every day
to the house, but they could not save the infant.When the next one
arrived, Dr.Inglis was so determined the child should live, she came
every day, whatever were her engagements, to sterilise the milk.The
child throve under her care, and grew up in health.Another of these patients of her care ‘could not control her feelings’
when speaking of the good physician.It was evident the family had
lost their best friend.Inglis’
kindness to them.She would come round, after she had finished her
other work at night, to bath the baby.When another child was ill, she
told the mother not to open the door even if the King himself wished
to come in.The husband said she was so bright one felt the better
for her visit, ‘though her orders had to be obeyed and no mistake,
and she would tell you off at once if you did not carry them out.’ If
they offered payment, she would say, ‘Now, go and buy a nice chop for
yourself.’

Another family had this story.G.: ‘That woman has done more
for the folk living between Morrison Street and the High Street than
all the ministers in Edinburgh and Scotland itself ever did for any
one.She gave her house, her
property, her practice, her money to help others.’ Mrs.G. fell ill
after the birth of one of her children.Elsie came in one night,
made her a cup of tea and some toast, and, as she failed to get well,
she raised money to keep her in a sanatorium for six months.After she
had been there one child, in charge of a friend, fell ill, and finally
died, Dr.Inglis doing all she could to spare the absent mother and
save the child.When it died, she wrote:--

 ‘MY DEAR MRS.Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.G.,--You will have got the news by now.I cannot tell
 you how sorry I am for you, my dear.But you will believe, won’t you,
 that we all did everything we could for your dear little boy.H. and I saw him three times a day
 between us, and yesterday we saw him four times.When I sent you the
 card I hoped the high temperature was due to his teeth, because his
 pulse seemed good.H. telephoned that she was
 afraid that his pulse was flagging, and he died suddenly about one.G. has just been here; you must get well, my dear, for his sake,
 and for the sake of all the other little children.Poor little Johnnie
 has had a great many troubles in his little life has he not?But he
 is over them all now, dear little man.And the God in whose _safe_
 keeping he is, comfort you, dear Mrs.G.--Ever your sincere friend,

      ‘ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

The caretaker of the dispensary in St.Cuthbert’s Mission in Morrison
Street speaks of Dr.Inglis as the true friend of all who needed her.She gave an hour three mornings in the week, and if she could not
overtake all the cases in the time, she would occasionally come back
later in the day.Another of her patients was the mother of twelve children; six of
them were ‘brought home’ by Dr.She was a friend to them all,
and never minded what trouble she took.If they did not send for her,
wishing to spare her, she scolded them for thinking of herself and not
of their need for her services.All the children loved her, and they
would watch from the window on her dispensary days for her, and she
would wave to them across the street.She would often stop them in
the street to ask after their mother, and even after she had been to
Serbia and returned to Edinburgh, she remembered about them and their
home affairs.She always made them understand that her orders must be
carried out.The eldest girl was washing the floor, and Dr.Inglis told her to
go for some medicine.The girl continued to finish the work she was at.Inglis, ‘don’t you know that when I say a thing I
mean it?’ Another time she had told Mrs.C. to remain in her bed till
she came.C. rose to wash the
dishes.Do not touch another dish.’ And she herself helped Mrs.Later on two of the children got scarlet fever, and Dr.Inglis told the
mother she was proud of her, as, through her care, the infection did
not spread in the family or outside it.The people in Morrison Street showed their gratitude by collecting
a little sum of money to buy an electric lamp to light their doctor
friend up the dark staircase of the house.These were the true mourners
who stood round St.Giles’ with the bairns she had ‘brought home’ on
the day when her earthly presence passed from their sight.These were
they who had fitted her for her strenuous enterprises in the day when
the battle was set in array, and these were the people who knew her
best, and never doubted that when called from their midst she would go
forth strong in that spirit which is given to the weak things of the
earth, and that it would be her part to strengthen the peoples that had
no might.The Little Sisters of the Poor had a dispensary of St.Elsie had it in her charge from 1903 to 1913, and the Sister Superior
speaks of the affection of the people and the good work done among them.‘“How often,” writes one in charge of the servant department of the
 Y.W.C.A., “her deliberate tread has brought confidence to me when
 getting heartless over some of these poor creatures who would not
 rouse themselves, judging the world was against them.Many a time
 the patient fighting with circumstances needed a sisterly word of
 cheer which Dr.Inglis supplied, and sent the individual heartened
 and refreshed.The expression on her face, _I mean business_, had
 a wonderful uplift, while her acuteness in exactly describing the
 symptoms to those who were in constant contact gave a confidence which
 made her a power amongst us.”’

A patient has allowed some of her written prescriptions to be quoted.They were not of a kind to be made up by a chemist:--

 ‘I want you never to miss or delay meals.I want you to go to bed at
 a reasonable time and go to sleep early.I want you to do your work
 regularly, and to take an interest in outside things--such as your
 church and suffrage.’

 ‘We should not let these Things (with a capital T) affect us so much.Our cause is too righteous for it to be really affected by them--if we
 don’t weaken.’

 ‘My dear, the potter’s wheel isn’t a pleasant instrument.’

 ‘Go home and say your prayers.’

 ‘Realise what you are, a free born child of the Universe.Perfection
 your Polar Star.’

These stories of her healing of mind and body might be endlessly
multiplied.Sorrow and disease are much the same whether they come to
the rich or the poor, and poverty is not always the worst trial of
many a sad tale.Elsie’s power of sympathy and understanding was
as much called upon in her paying practice as among the very poor.She
made no distinction in what she gave; her friendship was as ready as
her trained skill.There was one patient whose sufferings were largely
due to her own lack of will power.Elsie, after prescribing, bent down
and kissed her.It awoke in the individual the sense that she was not
‘altogether bad,’ and from that day forward there was a newness of life.From what sources of inner strength did she increasingly minister
in that sphere in which she moved?‘Thy touch has still its ancient
power,’ and no one who knew this unresting, unhasting, well-balanced
life, but felt it had drawn its spiritual strength from the deep wells
of Salvation.In these years the kindred points of heaven and home were always
in the background of her life.Her sisters’ homes were near her in
Edinburgh, and when her brother Ernest died in India, in 1910, his
widow and her three daughters came back to her house.Her friendship
and understanding of all the large circle that called her aunt was a
very beautiful tie.The elder ones were near enough to her own age
to be companions to her from her girlhood.Miss Simson says that she
was more like an elder sister to them when she stayed with the family
on their arrival from Tasmania.‘The next thing I remember about her
was when she went to school in Paris, she promised to bring us home
Paris dolls.She asked us how we wanted them dressed, and when she
returned we each received a beautiful one dressed in the manner chosen.Aunt Elsie was always most careful in the choice of presents for each
individual.One always felt that she had thought of and got something
that she knew you wanted.While on her way to Russia she sent me a
cheque because she had not been able to see anything while at home.She
wrote, “This is to spend on something frivolous that you want, and not
on stockings or anything like that.”’

‘It is not her great gifts that I remember now,’ says another of that
young circle, ‘it is that she was always such a darling.’

These nieces were often the companions of Dr.She
had her own ideas as to how these should be spent.She always had
September as her month of recreation.She used to go away, first of
all, for a fortnight quite alone to some out-of-the-way place, when
not even her letters were sent after her.She would book to a station,
get out, and bicycle round the neighbourhood till she found a place
she liked.She wanted scenery and housing accommodation according to
her mind.Her first requirement was hot water for ‘baths.’ If that was
found in abundance she was suited; if it could not be requisitioned,
she went elsewhere.Her paintbox went with her, and when she returned
to rejoin or fetch away her family she brought many impressions of what
she had seen.The holidays were restful because always well planned.She loved enjoyment and happiness, and she sought them in the spirit
of real relaxation and recreation.If weather or circumstances turned
out adverse, she was amused in finding some way out, and if nothing
else could be done she had a power of seeing the ludicrous under all
conditions, which in itself turned the rain-clouds of life into bursts
of sunlight.Inglis gives a happy picture of the life in 8 Walker Street, when
she was the guest of Dr.Her love for the three nieces, the one
in particular who bore her name, and in whose medical education she
deeply interested herself, was great.She used to return from a long day’s work, often late, but with a mind
at leisure from itself for the talk of the young people.However late
she was, a hot bath preluded a dinner-party full of fun and laughter,
the account of all the day’s doings, and then a game of bridge or some
other amusement.Often she would be anxious over some case, but she
used to say, ‘I have done all I know, I can only sleep over it,’ and
to bed and to sleep she went, always using her will-power to do what
was best in the situation.Those who were with her in the ‘retreats’
in Serbia or Russia saw the same quality of self-command.If transport
broke down, then the interval had better be used for rest, in the best
fashion in which it could be obtained.Her Sundays, as far as her profession permitted, were days of rest and
social intercourse with her family and friends.After evening church
she went always to supper in the Simson family, often detained late by
pacings to and fro with her friends, Dr.Wallace Williamson,
engaged in some outpouring of the vital interests which were absorbing
her.One of the members of her household says:--

 ‘We all used to look forward to hearing all her doings in the past
 week, and of all that lay before her in the next.Sunday evening felt
 quite wrong and flat when she was called out to a case and could not
 come to us.Her visit in
 September was the best bit of the holidays to us.She laid herself out
 to be with us in our bathing and golfing and picnics.’

The house was ‘well run.’ Those who know what is the highest meaning
of service, have always good servants, and Dr.Her cooks were all engaged under one stipulation, ‘Hot
water for any number of baths at any time of the day or night,’ and
the hot water never failed under the most exacting conditions.Her
guests were made very comfortable, and there was only one rigid rule
in the house.However late she came downstairs after any night-work,
there was always family prayers before breakfast.The book she used
was _Euchologion_, and when in Russia asked that a copy should be
sent her.Her consulting-room was lined with bookshelves containing
all her father’s books, and of these she never lost sight.Any guest
might borrow anything else in her house and forget to return it, but if
ever one of those books were borrowed, it had to be returned, for the
quest after it was pertinacious.In her dress she became increasingly
particular, but only as the adornment, not of herself, but of the cause
of women as citizens or as doctors.When a uniform became part of her
equipment for work, she must have welcomed it with great enthusiasm.It
is in the hodden grey with the tartan shoulder straps, and the thistles
of Scotland that she will be clothed upon, in the memory of most of
those who recall her presence.It is difficult to write of the things that belong to the Spirit,
and Dr.Elsie’s own reserve on these matters was not often broken.She had been reared in a God-fearing household, and surrounded from
her earliest years with the atmosphere of an intensely devout home.That she tried all things, and approved them to her own conscience,
was natural to her character.Certain doctrines and formulas found no
acceptance with her.Man was created in God’s image, and the Almighty
did not desire that His creatures should despise or underrate the work
of His Hand.The attitude of regarding the world as a desert, and human
beings as miserable sinners incapable of rendering the highest service,
never commended itself to her eminently just mind.Such difficulties of
belief as she may have experienced in early years lay in the relations
of the created to the Creator of all that is divine in man.Till she
had convinced herself that a reasonable service was asked for and would
be accepted, her mind was not completely at rest.In her correspondence
with her father, both in Glasgow and London, her interest was always
living and vital in the things which belonged to the kingdom of heaven
within.She wandered from church to church in both places.Oblivious
of all distinctions she would take her prayer book and go for ‘music’
to the Episcopal Church, or attend the undenominational meetings
connected with the Y.W.C.A.Often she found herself most interested
in the ministry of the Rev.Hunter, who subsequently left Glasgow
for London.There are many shrewd comments on other ministers, on the
‘Declaratory Acts,’ then agitating the Free Church.She thought the
Westminster Confession should either be accepted or rejected, and that
the position was made no simpler by ‘declarations.’ In London she
attended the English Church almost exclusively, listening to the many
remarkable teachers who in the Nineties occupied the pulpits of the
Anglican Church.It was not till after her father’s death that she came
to rest entirely in the ministry of the Church of Scotland, and found
in the teaching and friendship of Dr.Wallace Williamson that which
gave her the vital faith which inspired her life and work, and carried
her at last triumphantly through the swellings of Jordan.Giles’ lay in the centre of her healing mission, and her
alert active figure was a familiar sight, as the little congregation
gathered for the daily service.When the kirk skailed in the fading
light of the short days, the westering sun on the windows would often
fall on the fair hair and bright face of her whose day had been spent
in ministering work.On these occasions she never talked of her work.If she was joined by a friend, Dr.Elsie waited to see what was the
pressing thought in the mind of her companion, and into that she at
once poured her whole sympathy.Few ever walked west with her to
her home without feeling in an atmosphere of high and chivalrous
enterprise.Thus in an ordered round passed the days and years, drawing
ever nearer to the unknown destiny, when that which was to try the
reins and the hearts of many nations was to come upon the world.When
that storm burst, Elsie Inglis was among those whose lamp was burning,
and whose heart was steadfast and prepared for the things which were
coming on the earth.ELSIE INGLIS, 1916]




CHAPTER VIII

WAR AND THE SCOTTISH WOMEN

    ‘God the all-terrible King, Who ordainest
      Great winds Thy clarion, the lightnings Thy sword,
    Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest,
      Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.God the All-wise, by the fire of Thy chastening
      Earth shall to freedom and truth be restored,
    Through the thick darkness Thy kingdom is hastening,
      Thou wilt give peace in Thy time, O Lord.’


The year of the war coincided with that period in the life of Dr.Inglis when she was fully qualified for the great part she was to play
among the armies of the Allied nations.It is now admitted that this country was unprepared for war, and
incredulous as to the German menace.The services of women have now
attained so high a value in the State that it is difficult to recast
their condition in 1914.In politics there had been a succession of efforts to obtain
their enfranchisement.Each effort had been marked by a stronger
manifestation in their favour in the country, and the growing force
of the movement, coupled with the unrest in Ireland, had kept all
political organisations in a high state of tension.It has been shown how fully organised were all the Women Suffrage
societies.Committees, organisers, adherents, and speakers were at
work, and in the highest state of efficiency.Women linked by a common
cause had learnt how to work together.The best brains in their midst
were put at the service of the Suffrage, and they had watched in the
political arena where to expect support, and who could be trusted among
the leaders of all parties.No shrewder or more experienced body of
politicians were to be found in the country than those women drawn from
all classes, in all social, professional, and industrial spheres, who
acknowledged Mrs.Fawcett as their leader, and trusted no one party,
sect, or politician in the year 1914.When the war caused a truce to be pronounced in all questions of acute
political difference, the unenfranchised people realised that this
might mean the failure of their hopes for an indefinite time.They
never foresaw that, for the second time within a century, emancipation
was to be bought by the life blood of a generation.The truce made no difference to any section of the Suffrage party.War found both men and women
unprepared, but the path of glory was clear for the men.A great army
must be formed in defence of national liberty.It would have been well had the strength of the women been mobilised in
the same hour.Their long claim for the rights of citizenship made them
keenly alive and responsive to the call of national service.War and its consequences had for many years been uppermost in their
thoughts.In the struggle for emancipation, the great argument they
had had to face among the rapidly decreasing anti-party, was the one
that women could take no part in war, and, as all Government rested
ultimately on brute force, women could not fight, and therefore must
not vote.In countering this outlook, women had watched what war meant all over
the world, wherever it took place.With the use of scientific weapons
of destruction, with the development of scientific methods of healing,
with all that went to the maintenance of armies in the field, and the
support of populations at home, women had some vision in what manner
they would be needed if war ever came to this country.The misfortune of such a controversy as that of the ‘Rights of Women’
is that it necessarily means the opposition has to prove a negative
proposition--a most sterilising process.Political parties were so
anxious to prove that women were incapable of citizenship, that the
whole community got into a pernicious habit of mind.Women were
underrated in every sphere of industry or scientific knowledge.Their
sense of incapacity and irresponsibility was encouraged, and when they
turned militant under such treatment, they were only voted a nuisance
which it was impossible to totally exterminate.Those who watched the gathering war clouds, and the decline of their
Parliamentary hopes, did not realise that, in the overruling providence
of God, the devastating war among nations was to open a new era for
women.They were no longer to be held cheap, as irresponsibles--mere
clogs on the machinery of the State.They were to be called on to
take the place of men who were dying by the thousand for their homes,
fighting against the doctrine that military force is the only true
Government in a Christian world.After mobilisation, military authorities had to make provision for the
wounded.We can remember the early sensation of seeing buildings raised
for other purposes taken over for hospitals.Since the Crimea, women as
nurses at the base were institutions understood of all men.In the vast
camps which sprang up at the commencement of the war, women modestly
thought they might be usefully employed as cooks.The idea shocked the
War Office till it rocked to its foundations.A few adventurous women
started laundries for officers, and others for the men.They did it on
their own, and in peril of their beneficent soap suds, being ordered to
a region where they would be out of sight, and out of any seasonable
service, to the vermin-ridden camps.The Suffrage organisations, staffed and equipped with able practical
women Jacks of all trades, in their midst, put themselves at the call
of national service, but were headed back from all enterprises.It
had been ordained that women could not fight, and therefore they were
of no use in war time.A few persisted in trying to find openings for
service.It is one thing to offer to be
useful without any particular qualification; it is another to have
professional knowledge to give, and the medical women were strong in
the conviction that they had their hard-won science and skill to offer.Those who have read the preceding pages will realise that Dr.Inglis
carried into this offer a perfect knowledge how women doctors were
regarded by the community, and she knew political departments too well
to believe that the War Office would have a more enlightened outlook.In the past she had said in choosing her profession that she liked
‘pioneer work,’ and she was to be the pioneer woman doctor who, with
the aid of Suffrage societies, founded and led the Scottish Women’s
Hospitals to the healing of many races.Inglis to this point, it is easy
to imagine the working of her fertile brain, and her sense of vital
energy, in the opening weeks of the war.What material for instant
action she had at hand, she used.She had helped to form a detachment
of the V.A.D.when the idea of this once despised and now greatly
desired body began to take shape.Before the war men spoke slightingly
of its object, and it was much depreciated.Inglis saw all the
possibilities which lay in the voluntary aid offer.Inglis was in
Edinburgh at the commencement of the war, and the 6th Edinburgh V.A.D.,
of which she was commandant, was at once mobilised.For several weeks
she worked hard at their training.She gave up the principal rooms in
her house for a depot for the outfit of Cargilfield as an auxiliary
hospital.Inglis
put in charge of it, the wider work of her life might never have had
its fulfilment.Inglis from the first advocated that the V.A.D.should be used as probationers in military hospitals, and the orderlies
who served in her units were chiefly drawn from this body.In September she went to London to put her views before the National
Union and the War Office, and to offer the services of herself
and women colleagues.Miss Mair expresses the thoughts which were
dominating her mind.‘To her it seemed wicked that women with power
to wield the surgeon’s knife in the mitigation of suffering and with
knowledge to diagnose and cure, should be withheld from serving the
sick and wounded.’

Her love for the wounded and suffering gave her a clear vision as
to what lay before the armies of the Allies.‘At the root of all her
strenuous work of the last three years,’ says her sister, ‘was the
impelling force of her sympathy with the wounded men.This feeling
amounted at times to almost agony.Only once did she allow herself to
show this innermost feeling.This was at the root of her passionate
yearning to get with her unit to Mesopotamia during the early months
of 1916.“I cannot bear to think of them, _our Boys_.” To the woman’s
heart within her the wounded men of all nations made the same
irresistible appeal.’

In that spirit she approached a departmental chief.Official reserve at
last gave way, and the historic sentence was uttered--‘My good lady, go
home and sit still.’ In that utterance lay the germ of that inspiration
which was to carry the Red Cross and the Scottish women among many
nations, kindreds, and tongues.The overworked red-tape-bound
official: the little figure of the woman with the smile, and the ready
answer, before him.There is a story that, while a town in Serbia was
under bombardment, Dr.Inglis was also in it with some of her hospital
work.She sought an official in his quarters, as she desired certain
things for her hospital.The noise of the firing was loud, and shells
were flying around.Inglis seemed oblivious of any sound save her
own voice, and she requested of an under officer an interview with his
chief.The official had at last to confess that his superior was hiding
in the cellar till the calamity of shell-fire was overpast.In much
the same condition was the local War Office official when confronted
with Dr.No doubt she saw it was
useless to continue her offers of service.Fawcett says:

 ‘Nearly all the memorial notices of her have recorded the fact that at
 the beginning of her work in 1914 the War Office refused her official
 recognition.The recognition so stupidly refused by her own country
 was joyfully and gratefully given by the French and later the Serbian
 A.M.S.and Red Cross.’

She went home to her family, who so often had inspired her to good
work, and as she sat and talked over the war and her plans with one of
her nieces, she suddenly said, ‘I know what we will do!We will have a
unit of our own.’

The ‘We’ referred to that close-knit body of women with whom she had
worked for a common cause, and she knew at once that ‘We’ would work
with her and in her for the accomplishment of this ideal which so
rapidly took shape in her teeming brain.She was never left alone in any part of her life’s work.Her
personality knit not only her family to her in the closest bonds of
love, but she had devoted friends among those who did not see eye
to eye with her in the common cause.She never loved them the less
for disagreeing with her, and though their indifference to her views
might at times obscure her belief in their mental calibre, it never
interfered with the mutual affections of all.She did not leave these
friends out of her scheme when it began to take shape.The Edinburgh Suffrage offices, no longer needed for propaganda and
organisation work, became the headquarters of the Scottish Women’s
Hospitals, and the enlarged committee, chiefly of Dr.Inglis’ personal
friends, began its work under the steam-hammer of her energy.‘Well do I recall the first suggestion that passed between us on the
 subject of directing the energies of our Suffrage Societies to the
 starting of a hospital.Let us gather a few hundred pounds, and then
 appeal to the public, was the decision of our ever courageous Dr.Elsie, and from that moment she never swerved in her purpose.Some of
 us gasped when she announced that the sum of £50,000 must speedily
 be advertised for.Some timid souls advised the naming of a smaller
 amount as our goal.With unerring perception, our leader refused to
 lower the standard, and abundantly has she been proved right!Not
 £50,000, but over £200,000 have rewarded her faith and her hope.‘This quick perception was one of the greatest of her gifts, and it
 was with perfect simplicity she stated to me once that when on rare
 occasions she had yielded her own conviction to pressure from others,
 the result had been unfortunate.There was not an ounce of vanity in
 her composition.She saw the object aimed at, and she marched
 straight on.If, on the road, some obstacles had to be not exactly
 ruthlessly, but very firmly brushed aside, her strength of purpose
 was in the end a blessing to all concerned.Strength combined with
 sweetness--with a wholesome dash of humour thrown in--in my mind sums
 up her character.What that strength did for agonised Serbia only the
 grateful Serbs can fully tell.’

A letter written in October of this year to Mrs.Fawcett tells of the
rapid formation of the hospital idea.‘8 WALKER STREET,
      ‘_Oct.FAWCETT,--I wrote to you from the office this morning,
 but I want to point out a little more fully what the Committee felt
 about the name of the hospitals.We felt that our original scheme
 was growing very quickly into something very big--much bigger than
 anything we had thought of at the beginning--and we felt that if the
 hospitals were called by a non-committal name it would be much easier
 to get all men and women to help.The scheme is _of course_ a National
 Union scheme, and that fact the Scottish Federation will never lose
 sight of, or attempt to disguise.The National Union will be at the
 head of all our appeals, and press notices, and paper.‘But--if you could reverse the position, and imagine for a moment
 that the Anti-Suffrage Society had thought of organising all these
 skilled women for service, you can quite see that many more neutrals,
 and a great many suffragists would have been ready to help if they
 sent their subscriptions to the “Scottish Women’s Hospital for Foreign
 Service,” than if they had to send to the Anti-Suffrage League
 Hospital.‘We were convinced that the more women we could get to help, the
 greater would be the gain to the woman’s movement.‘For we have hit upon a really splendid scheme.Laurie and
 I went to see Sir George Beatson--the head of the Scottish Red Cross,
 in Glasgow--he said at once: “Our War Office will have nothing to say
 to you,” and then he added, “yet there is no knowing what they may do
 before the end of the war.”

 ‘You see, we get these expert women doctors, nurses, and ambulance
 workers organised.Once
 these units are out, the work is bound to grow.The need is there,
 and too terrible to allow any haggling about who does the work.If
 we have a thoroughly good organisation here, we can send out more
 and more units, or strengthen those already out.We can add motor
 ambulances, organise rest stations on the lines of communication, and
 so on.It will all depend on how well we are supplied with funds and
 brains at our base.Each unit ought to be carefully chosen, and the
 very best women doctors must go out with them.I wrote this morning to
 the Registered Medical Women’s Association in London, and asked them
 to help us, and offered to address a meeting when I come up for your
 meeting.Next week a special meeting of the Scottish Medical Women’s
 Association is being called to discuss the question.‘From the very beginning we must make it clear that our hospitals are
 as well-equipped and well-manned as any in the field, more economical
 (easy!‘I cannot think of anything more calculated to bring home to men the
 fact that women _can help_ intelligently in any kind of work.So much
 of our work is done where they cannot see it.They’ll see every bit of
 this.‘The fates seem to be fighting for us!Sometimes schemes do float off
 with the most extraordinary ease.The Belgian Consul here is Professor
 Sarolea--the editor of _Everyman_.He grasped at the help we offered,
 and has written off to several influential people.And then yesterday
 morning he wrote saying that his brother Dr.Leon Sarolea, would come
 and “work under” us.He is an M.P., a man of considerable influence.So you can see the Belgian Hospital will have everything in its favour.Seton Watson, who has devoted his life to the Balkan States,
 has taken up the Servian Unit.He puts himself “entirely at our
 service.” He knows all the powers that be in Servia.‘Two people in the Press have offered to help.It must not be wasted, but we must have
 lots.‘And as the work grows do let’s keep it _together_, so that, however
 many hospitals we send out, they all shall be run on the same lines,
 and wherever people see the Union Jack with the red, white and green
 flag below it, they’ll know it means efficiency and kindness and
 intelligence.‘I wanted the Executive, for this reason, to call the hospitals
 “British Women’s Hospitals for Foreign Service,” but of course it was
 their own idea, and one understood the desire to call it “Scottish”;
 but if there is a splendid response from England and from other
 federations, that will have to be reconsidered, _I_ think.The great
 thing is to do the thing well, and do it as _one_ scheme.‘I do hope you’ll approve of all this.I am marking this letter
 “Private,” because it isn’t an official letter, but just what I
 think--to you, my Chief.But you can show it to anybody you like--as
 that.‘I can think of nothing except these “Units” just now!And when one
 hears of the awful need, one can hardly sit still till they are ready.Professor Sarolea simply made one’s heart bleed.He said, “You talk of distress from the war here.You simply
 know nothing about it.”--Ever yours sincerely,

      ‘ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

In October 1914 the scheme was finally adopted by the Scottish
Federation, and the name of Scottish Women’s Hospitals was chosen.At the same meeting the committee decided to send Dr.Inglis to London
to explain the plan to the National Union, and to speak at a meeting
in the Kingsway Hall, on ‘What women could do to help in the war.’ At
that meeting she was authorised to speak on the plans of the S.W.H.The N.U.W.S.S.adopted the plan of campaign on 15th October, and the
London society was soon taking up the work of procuring money to start
new units, and to send Dr.Inglis out on her last enterprise, with a
unit fully equipped to work with the Serbian army, then fighting on the
Bulgarian front.Sandra travelled to the hallway.The use she made of individuals is well illustrated by Miss Burke.She
was ‘found’ by Dr.Inglis in the office of the London Society, and sent
forth to speak and fill the Treasury chest of the S.W.H.It is written
in the records of that work how wonderfully Miss Burke influenced her
countrymen in America, and how nobly, through her efforts, they have
aided ‘the great adventure.’

      ‘U.S.M.S.Paul_,
      ‘_Saturday, February 9th_.‘DEAR LADY FRANCES,--Certainly I am one of Dr.It
 was largely due to her intuition and clear judgment of character that
 my feet were placed in the path which led to my reaching my maximum
 efficiency as a hospital worker and a member of the Scottish Women’s
 Hospitals.Elsie after I had been the Secretary of the
 London Committee for about a month.There was no question of meeting a
 “stranger”; her kindly eyes smiled straight into mine.Well, the best way to encourage me was to
 give me responsibility.‘“Do you speak French?”

 ‘“Yes.”

 ‘“Very well, go and write me a letter to General de Torcy, telling him
 we accept the building he has offered at Troyes.”

 ‘Some one hazarded the suggestion that the letter should be passed on.‘“Nonsense,” replied Dr.Elsie, “I know the type.If she says she speaks French, she does.”

 ‘She practically signed the letter I wrote her without reading it.Doubtless all the time I was with her I was under her keen scrutiny,
 and when finally, after arranging a meeting for her at Oxford, which
 she found impossible to take, owing to her sudden decision to leave
 for Serbia, she had already judged me, and without hesitation she told
 me to go to Oxford and speak myself.I have wondered often whether any
 one else would have sent a young and unknown speaker--it needed Dr.Elsie’s knowledge of human character and rapid energetic method of
 making decisions.‘It would be difficult for we young ones of the Scottish Women’s
 Hospitals to analyse our feelings towards Dr.A wave of her
 hand in passing meant much to us.’

Space utterly forbids our following the fortunes of the Scottish
Women’s Hospitals as they went forth one by one to France, to Belgium,
to Serbia, to Corsica, and Russia.That history will have some day to
be written.It is only possible in this memoir to speak of their work
in relation to their founder and leader.‘Not I, but my unit,’ was
her dying watchword, and when the work of her unit is reviewed, it is
obvious how they carried with them, as an oriflamme, the inspiration of
unselfish devotion set them by Dr.Besides going into all the detailed work of the hospital equipment, Dr.Inglis found time to continue her work of speaking for the cause of the
hospitals.We find her addressing her old friends:

 ‘I have the happiest recollection of Dr.I. addressing a small meeting
 of the W. L. Association here.It was one of her first meetings to
 raise money.She told us how she wanted to go to Serbia.She was so
 convincing, but with all my faith in her, I never thought she _would_
 get there!That, and much more she did--a lesson in faith.‘She looked round the little gathering in the Good Templar Hall and
 said, “I suppose nobody here could lend me a yacht?” She did get her
 ship there.’

To one of her workers in this time, she said, ‘My dear, we shall live
all our lives in the shadow of war.’ The one to whom she spoke says, ‘A
cold chill struck my heart.Did she feel it, and know that never again
would things be as they were?’

At the close of 1914 Dr.Inglis went to France to see the Scottish
Women’s Hospital established and working under the French Red Cross at
Royaumont.It was probably on her way back that she went to Paris on
business connected with Royaumont.She went into Notre Dame, and chose
a seat in a part of the cathedral where she could feel alone.She there
had an experience which she afterwards told to Mrs.As she
sat there she had a strong feeling that some one was behind her.She
resisted the impulse to turn round, thinking it was some one who like
herself wanted to be quiet!The feeling grew so strong at last, that
she involuntarily turned round.There was no one near her, but for the
first time she realised she was sitting in front of a statue of Joan of
Arc.To her it appeared as if the statue was instinct with life.She
added: ‘Wasn’t it curious?’ Then later she said, ‘I would like to know
what Joan was wanting to say to me!’ I often think of the natural way
which she told me of the experience, and the _practical_ conclusion
of wishing to know what Joan wanted.Once again she referred to the
incident, before going to Russia.I see her expression now, just for a
moment forgetting everything else, keen, concentrated, and her humorous
smile, as she said, ‘You know I would like awfully to know what Joan
was trying to say to me.’

Elsie Inglis was not the first, nor will she be the last woman who has
found help in the story of the Maid of Orleans, when the causes dear to
the hearts of nations are at stake.It is easy to hear the words that
would pass between these two leaders in the time of their country’s
warfare.The graven figure of Joan was instinct with life, from the
undying love of race and country, which flowed back to her from the
woman who was as ready to dedicate to her country her self-forgetting
devotion, as Jeanne d’Arc had been in her day.Both, in their day and
generation, had heard--

    ‘The quick alarming drum--
    Saying, Come,
    Freemen, come,
    Ere your heritage be wasted, said the quick alarming drum.’

      ‘ABBAYE DE ROYAUMONT,
      ‘_Dec.‘DEAREST AMY,--Many, many happy Christmases to you, dear, and to
 all the others.Everything is splendid here now, and if the General
 from headquarters would only come and inspect us, we could begin.I only wish you could see them with their
 red bedcovers, and little tables.There are four wards, and we have
 called them Blanche of Castille (the woman who really started the
 building of this place, the mother of Louis IX., the Founder, as he
 is called), Queen Margaret of Scotland, Joan of Arc, and Millicent
 Fawcett.Now, don’t you think that is rather nice!The Abbaye itself
 is a wonderful place.It has beautiful architecture, and is placed in
 delightful woods.One wants to spend hours exploring it, instead of
 which we have all been working like galley slaves getting the hospital
 in order.There are
 no thermometers and no sandbags.Yesterday,
 I was told there were no tooth-brushes and no nail-brushes, but they
 appeared.After all the fuss, you can imagine our feelings when the
 “Director,” an official of the French Red Cross, who has to live here
 with us, told us French soldiers don’t want tooth-brushes!‘Our first visitors were three French officers, whom we took for the
 inspecting general, and treated with grovelling deference, till we
 found they knew nothing about it, and were much more interested in the
 tapestry in the proprietor’s house than in our instruments.However,
 they were very nice, and said we were _bien meublé_.‘Once we had all been on tenterhooks all day about the inspection.Suddenly, a man poked his head round the door of the doctor’s
 sitting-room and said, “The General.” In one flash every doctor was
 out of the room and into her bedroom for her uniform coat, and I was
 left sitting.I got up, and wandered downstairs, when an excited
 orderly dashed past, singing, “Nothing but two British officers!”
 Another time we were routed out from breakfast by the cry of “The
 General,” but this time it turned out to be a French regiment, whose
 officers had been moved by curiosity to come round by here.‘We have had to get a new boiler in the kitchen, new taps and
 lavatories, and electric light, an absolute necessity in this huge
 place, and all the theatre sinks.We certainly are no longer a
 _mobile_ hospital, but as we are twelve miles from the point from
 which the wounded are distributed (I am getting very discreet about
 names since a telegram of mine was censored), we shall probably be as
 useful here as anywhere.They even think we may get English Tommies.‘You have no idea of the conditions to which the units came out, and
 they have behaved like perfect bricks.The place was like an ice hole:
 there were no fires, no hot water, no furniture, not even blankets,
 and the equipment did not arrive for five days.They have scrubbed the
 whole place out themselves, as if they were born housemaids; put up
 the beds, stuffed the mattresses, and done everything.They stick at absolutely nothing, and when Madame came,
 she said, “What it is to belong to a practical nation!”

 ‘We had a service in the ward on Sunday.We are going to see if they
 will let us use the little St.There are two other
 chapels, one in use, that we hope the soldiers will go to, and a
 beautiful chapel the same style of architecture as the chapel at Mont
 St.It is a perfect joy to walk through it to meals.The
 village curé has been to tea with us.‘Will you believe it, that General hasn’t arrived _yet_!--Your loving

      ELSIE.’

Mr.Seton Watson has permitted his article in the December number of
the _New Europe_ (1917) to be reprinted here.His complete knowledge
of Serbia enables him to describe both the work and Dr.Inglis who
undertook the great task set before her.‘Elsie Inglis was one of the heroic figures of the war, one whose
 memory her many friends will cherish with pride and confidence--pride
 at having been privileged to work with her, confidence in the race
 which breeds such women.This is not the place to tell the full story
 of her devotion to many a good cause at home, but the _New Europe_
 owes her a debt of special interest and affection.For in her own
 person she stood for that spirit of sympathy and comprehension upon
 which intercourse between the nations must be founded, if the ideal of
 a New Europe is ever to become a reality.‘Though her lifework had hitherto lain in utterly different fields,
 she saw in a flash the needs of a tragic situation; and when war came
 offered all her indomitable spirit and tireless energy to a cause
 till recently unknown and even frowned upon in our country.Like
 the Douglas of old, she flung herself where the battle raged most
 fiercely--always claiming and at last obtaining permission to set up
 her hospitals where the obstacles were greatest and the dangers most
 acute.But absorbed as she was in her noble task of healing, she saw
 beyond it the high national ideal that inspired the Serbs to endure
 sufferings unexampled even in this war, and became an enthusiastic
 convert to the cause of Southern Slav unity.To her, as to all true
 Europeans, the principle of nationality is not, indeed, the end of
 all human wisdom, but the sure foundation upon which a new and saner
 internationalism is to be built, and an inalienable right to which
 great and small alike are entitled.Perhaps the fact that she herself
 came of a small nation which, like Serbia, has known how to celebrate
 its defeats, was not without its share in determining her sympathies.‘The full political meaning of her work has not yet been brought home
 to her countrymen, and yet what she has done will live after her.Her
 achievement in Serbia itself in 1915 was sufficiently remarkable, but
 even that was a mere prelude to her achievement on the Eastern front.The Serbian Division in Southern Russia, which the Scottish Women’s
 Hospitals went out to help, was not Serbian at all in the _ordinary_
 sense of the word.Its proper name is the Jugoslav Division, for
 it was composed entirely of volunteers drawn from among the Serbs,
 Croats, and Slovenes of Austria-Hungary who had been taken prisoners
 by the Russian army.Thousands of these men enrolled themselves on the
 side of the Entente and in the service of Serbia, in order to fight
 for the realisation of Southern Slav independence and unity under the
 national dynasty of Kara George.Beyond the ordinary risks of war
 they acted in full knowledge that capture by the enemy would mean the
 same fate as Austria meted out to the heroic Italian deputy, Cesare
 Battisti; and some of them, left wounded on the battle-field after
 a retreat, shot each other to avoid being taken alive.Throughout
 the Dobrudja campaign they fought with the most desperate gallantry
 against impossible odds, and, owing to inadequate support during the
 retreat, their main body was reduced from 15,000 to 4000.Latterly the
 other divisions had been withdrawn to recruit at Odessa, after sharing
 the defence of the Rumanian southern front.‘To these men in the summer of 1916 Serbia had sent a certain number
 of higher officers, but, for equipment and medical help, they were
 dependent upon what the Russians could spare from their own almost
 unlimited needs.Inglis and her unit came to the
 help of the Jugoslavs, shared their privations and misfortunes, and
 spared no effort in their cause.‘History will record the name of Elsie Inglis, like that of Lady
 Paget, as pre-eminent among that band of women who have redeemed for
 all time the honour of Britain in the Balkans.Among the Serbs it is
 already assuming an almost legendary quality.To us it will serve to
 remind us that Florence Nightingale will never be without successors
 among us.And in particular, every true Scotsman will cherish her
 memory, every believer in the cause for which she gave her life will
 gain fresh courage from her example.R. W. SETON-WATSON.CHAPTER IX

SERBIA

    ‘Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great
    waters, from the hand of strange children.’

    ‘And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.For in those
    days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the
    creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.’

    ‘On either side of the river, was there the tree of life: And the
    leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.’


Dr.Inglis remained at home directing the many operations necessary
to ensure the proper equipment of the units, and the difficult task of
getting them conveyed overseas.From the beginning, till her return
with her unit serving with the Serbian army in Russia, she had the
sustaining co-operation both of the Admiralty and the Foreign Office.In the many complications surrounding the history of the hospitals
with the Allied armies, the Scottish women owed very much to both
Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs, and very particularly to Lord
Robert Cecil in his department of the Foreign Office.It was not easy to get the scheme of hospitals staffed entirely by
women, serving abroad with armies fighting the common and unscrupulous
foe, accepted by those in authority.The Foreign Office was responsible
for the safety of these British outpost hospitals, and they knew well
the dangers and privations to which the devoted pioneer band of women
would be exposed.Inglis, which
she accepted, and abided by as long as her work was not hindered.No
care or diplomatic work was spared, and if at the end of their service
in Russia the safety of the unit was a matter of grave anxiety to
the Foreign Office, it had never cause to be ashamed of the way this
country’s honour and good faith was upheld by the hospitals under the
British flag, amid the chaotic sufferings of the Russian people.Eleanor Soltau, who was in charge of the
First Serbian Unit, became ill with diphtheria in the midst of the
typhus epidemic which was devastating the Serbian people.The Serbian
Minister writes of that time:--

 ‘They were the first to go to the help of Serbia when the Austrians,
 after they were defeated, besides 60,000 prisoners, also left behind
 them epidemics in all the districts which they had invaded.The
 Scottish women turned up their sleeves, so to speak, at the railways
 station itself, and went straight to typhus and typhoid-stricken
 patients, who were pitifully dying in the crowded hospitals.’

Colonel Hunter, A.M.S., wrote after her death: ‘It was my privilege
and happiness to see much of her work in Serbia when I was officer in
charge of the corps of R.A.M.C.officers sent out by the W.O.to deal
with the raging epidemic of typhus and famine fevers then devastating
the land.I have never met with any one who gave me so deep an
impression of singlemindedness, gentleheartedness, clear and purposeful
vision, wise judgment, and absolutely fearless disposition.... No more
lovable personality than hers, or more devoted and courageous body of
women, ever set out to help effectively a people in dire distress than
the S.W.H.,’ which she organised and sent out, and afterwards took
personal charge of in Serbia in 1915.Amidst the most trying conditions
she, or they, never faltered in courage or endurance.Under her wise
and gentle leadership difficulties seemed only to stir to further
endeavour, more extended work, and greater endurance of hardship.Captain Ralph Glyn writes from France:--

 ‘I see you went to the funeral of that wonderful person, Dr.I shall never forget arriving where that S.W.unit was in the
 midst of the typhus in Serbia, and finding her and all her people so
 “clean” and obviously ready for anything.’

The Serbian nation lost no time in commemorating her services to them.At Mladenovatz they built a beautiful fountain close to the camp
hospital.On 7th October 1915 it was formally opened with a religious
service according to the rites of the Greek Church.Inglis turned
on the water, which was to flow through the coming years in grateful
memory of the good work done by the Scottish Women’s Hospitals.ELSIE INGLIS

 (Obiit Nov.At Mladenovatz still the fountain sings
      Raised by the Serbs to you their angel friend,
      Who fought the hunger-typhus to its end;
    A nobler fountain from your memory springs,
    A fountain-head where Faith renews its wings
      --Faith in the powers of womanhood to bend
      War’s curse to blessing, and to make amend
    By Love, for Hate’s unutterable things.Wherefore, when cannon-voices cease to roar,
      A louder voice shall echo in our ears
        --Voice of three peoples joined in one accord,
    Telling that, gentle to your brave heart’s core,
      You faced unwavering all that woman fears,
        And clear of vision followed Christ the Lord.[NOTE.--Two years ago the Serbians dedicated a simple fountain in
 ‘Mladenovatz’ to the grateful memory of one they spoke of as ‘the
 angel of their people.’ The Rumanian and Russian refugees in the
 Dobrudja will never forget her.]_The Englishwoman_, April and June 1916, has two articles written by
Dr.Inglis, under the title ‘The Tragedy of Serbia.’ The literary power
of her narrative makes one regret that she did not live to give a
consecutive account of all she passed through in the countries in which
she suffered with the peoples:--

 ‘When we reached Serbia in May 1915, she was lying in sunshine.Two
 storms had raged over her during the preceding months--the Austrian
 invasion and the terrific typhus epidemic.In our safe little island
 we can hardly realise what either meant.At the end of 1914, the
 Austrian Empire hurled its “punitive expedition” across the Danube--a
 punitive expedition that ended in the condign punishment of the
 invader.They left behind them a worse foe than themselves, and the
 typhus, which began in the hospitals they left so scandalously filthy
 and overcrowded, swept over the land.’

Dr.Inglis describes ‘the long peaceful summer,’ with its hopes of
an advance to their aid on the part of the Allies.The Serbs were
conscious the ‘Great Powers’ owed them much, for how often we heard the
words, ‘We are the only one, as yet, who has beaten our enemy.’

‘Not till September did any real sense of danger trouble them.Then the
clouds rolled up black and threatening on the horizon--Bulgaria arming,
and a hundred thousand Germans massing on the northern frontier.They
began to draw off the main part of their army from the Danube towards
the east, to meet their old enemies.The Powers refused to let them
attack, and they waited till the Bulgarian mobilisation was complete.The Allies discounted the attack from the north; aeroplanes had been
out, and “there are no Germans there.” There are no signs whatever of
any military movements, so said the wiseacres.The only troops there
are untrained Austrian levies, which the Serbs ought to be able to deal
with themselves, if they are up to their form last year.The 100,000 Germans appeared on the northern
frontier.The Bulgars invaded from the east, the Greeks did not come
in, and the Austrians poured in from the west.The Serbian army
shortened the enormous line they had to defend, but they could not
stand against the long-distance German guns, and so began the retreat.‘“What is coming to Serbia?” said a Serb to me, “we cannot think.”
And then, hopefully, “But God is great and powerful, and our Allies
are great and powerful too.” Strong men could hardly speak of the
disaster without breaking down.“When
are your men coming up?They must come soon.” “We must give our people
two months,” the experts among us answered, “to bring up the heavy
artillery.We thought the Serbs would be able to hold the West Morava
Valley.” “It is too hilly for the German artillery to be of any use,”
they said.’

Dr.Inglis goes on to relate how all the calculations were wrong, how
the Austrian force came down that very valley.The Serbs were caught
in a trap, and that 160,000 of their gallant little army escaped was
a wonderful feat.‘That they are already keen to take the field again
is but one more proof of the extraordinary recuperative power of the
nation.’

Dr.Elsie gives an account of the typhus epidemic.Soltau, in 1914, was able at Kragujevatz to do excellent
work for the Serbian army after its victories, and it was only
evacuated owing to the retreat in October 1915.The unit had only
been a fortnight out when the committee got from it a telegram, ‘dire
necessity’ for more doctors and nurses.The word _dire_ was used,
hoping it would pass unnoticed by the censor, for the authorities did
not wish the state of Serbia from typhus to be generally known.We
shall never know what the death-rate was during the epidemic; but of
the 425 Serbian doctors, 125 died of the disease, and two-thirds of the
remainder had it.The Scottish Committee hastened out supplies and staff.‘For three months the epidemic raged, and all women may ever be proud
 of the way those women worked.It was like a long-drawn-out battle,
 and not one of them played the coward.Not one of them asked to come
 away.There were three deaths and nine cases of illness among the
 unit; and may we not truly claim that those three women who died gave
 their lives for the great cause for which our country stands to-day as
 much as any man in the trenches.’

Dr.Inglis speaks of the full share of work taken by other British
units--Lady Paget’s Hospital at Skopio, ‘magnificently organised’; The
Red Cross under Dr.Banks ‘took more than its share of the burden’; and
how Dr.Ryan of the American hospital asserted that Serbia would have
been wiped out but for the work of the Foreign Missions.Miss Holme tells of some of her experiences with her leader:--

      ‘KRAGUJEVATZ.Elsie Inglis took me out shopping with her, and we
 wanted a great many things for our hospital in the way of drugs, etc.,
 and we also wanted more than anything else some medical scales for
 weighing drugs.Inglis saw hanging up
 in it three pairs of these scales.So she asked the man, in her most
 persuasive manner, if he would sell her a pair of these scales for our
 hospital use.He explained at length that he used all the scales, and
 was sorry that he could not possibly sell them.Inglis bought
 some more things--in fact, we stayed in the shop for about an hour
 buying things to the amount of £10, and between each of the different
 articles purchased, she would again revert to the scales and say,
 “You know it is for _your_ men that we want them,” until at last the
 man--exhausted by his refusals--took down the scales and presented
 them to her.When she asked “How much are they?” he made a bow, and
 said it would be a pleasure to give them to her.‘When we were taken prisoners, and had been so for some time, and
 before we were liberated, the German Command came bringing a paper
 which they commanded Dr.The purport of the paper was
 a statement which declared that the British prisoners had been well
 treated in the hands of the Germans, and was already signed by two men
 who were heads of other British units.Inglis said, “Why should
 I sign this paper?I do not know if all the prisoners are being well
 treated by you, therefore I decline to sign it.” To which the German
 authorities replied, “You must sign it.” Dr.Inglis then said, “Well,
 make me,” and that was the end of that incident--she never did sign it.‘So convinced were some of the people belonging to the Scottish
 Women’s unit that the British forces were coming to the aid of their
 Serbian ally, that long after they were taken prisoners they thought,
 each time they heard a gun from a different quarter, that their
 liberators were close at hand.So much so indeed, that three of the
 members of the unit begged that in the event of the unit being sent
 home they might be allowed to stay behind in Serbia with the Serbs,
 to help the Serbian Red Cross.Inglis _unofficially_ consented to
 this, and with the help of the Serbian Red Cross these three people in
 question adjourned to a village hard by which was about a mile from
 the hospital, three days before the unit had orders to move.Inglis and three other people of the unit knew where these
 three members were living.However, the date of the departure was
 changed, and the unit was told they were to wait another twenty days.This made it impossible for these three people to appear again with
 the unit.They continued to live at the little house which sheltered
 them.Suddenly one afternoon one of the members of the unit went to
 ask at the German Command if there were any letters for the unit.At
 this interview, which took place about three o’clock in the afternoon,
 the person was informed that the whole unit was to leave that night
 at 7.30.Inglis sent the person who received this command to tell
 the three people in the cottage to get ready, and that they must go,
 she thought.But the messenger only said, “We have had orders that the
 unit is to go at 7.30 to-night,” but did not say that Dr.Inglis had
 sent an order for the three people to get ready, so they did nothing
 but simply went to bed at ten o’clock, thinking the unit had already
 started.It was a wintry night, snowing heavily, and not a night that
 one would have sent out a dog!‘At about half-past ten a knock came to the window, and Dr.Inglis’
 voice was heard saying, “You have to come at once to the train.I
 am here with an armed guard!” (All the rest of the unit had been at
 the station for some hours, but the train was not allowed to start
 until every one was there.)It was
 difficult to get her to enter the house, and naturally she seemed
 rather ruffled, having had to come more than a mile in the deep snow,
 as she was the only person who knew anything about us.One of the
 party said, “Are you really cross, or are you pretending because the
 armed guard understands English?” She gave her queer little smile, and
 said, “No, I am not pretending.” The whole party tramped through the
 snow to the station, and on the way she told them she was afraid that
 she had smashed somebody’s window, having knocked at another cottage
 before she found ours in the dark, thinking it was the one we lived
 in, for which she was very much chaffed by her companions, who knew
 well her views on the question of militant tactics!‘The first stages of this journey were made in horse-boxes with no
 accommodation whatsoever.Occasionally the train drew up in the middle
 of the country, and anybody who wished to get out had simply to ask
 the sentry who guarded the door, to allow them to get out for a moment.‘The next night was spent lying on the floor of the station at
 Belgrade, the eight sentries and all their charges all lying on the
 floor together; the only person who seemed to be awake was the officer
 who guarded the door himself all night.In the morning one was not
 allowed to go even to wash one’s hands without a sentry to come and
 stand at the door.The next two days were spent in an ordinary train
 rather too well heated with four a side in second-class compartments.At Vienna all the British units who were being sent away were formed
 into a group on the station at 6 A.M., where they awaited the arrival
 of the American Consul, guarded all the time by their sentries, who
 gave his parole that if the people were allowed to go out of the
 station they would return at eight o’clock, the time they had to leave
 that town.Inglis with a party adjourned to a
 hotel where baths, etc., were provided.Other members were allowed to
 do what they liked.‘The unit was detained for eight days at Bludenz, close to the
 frontier, for Switzerland.On their arrival at Zürich they were met
 by the British Consul-General, Vice-Consul, and many members of the
 British Colony, who gave Dr.Inglis and her unit a very warm-hearted
 welcome, bringing quantities of flowers, and doing all they could to
 show them kindness and pleasure at their safe arrival.‘It is difficult for people who have never been prisoners to know what
 the first day’s freedom means.Everybody had a different expression,
 and seemed to have a different outlook on life.But already we could
 see our leader was engrossed with plans and busy with schemes for the
 future work of the unit.‘The next day the Consul-General made a speech in which he told the
 unit all that had passed during the last four months, of which they
 knew nothing.’

_To her Sister._

      ‘BRINDISI, _en route_ for SERBIA,
      ‘_April 28, 1915_.‘The boat ought to have left last night, but it did not even come in
 till this morning.However, we have only lost twenty-four hours.‘It has been a most luxurious journey, except the bit from Naples
 here, and that was rather awful, with spitting men and shut windows,
 in first-class carriages, remember.When we got here we immediately
 ordered baths, but “the boiler was broken.” So, I said, “Well, then,
 we must go somewhere else”--with the result that we were promised
 baths in our rooms at once.That was a nice bath, and then I curled
 up on the sofa and went to sleep.Our windows look right on to the
 docks, and the blue Mediterranean beyond.It is so queer to see the
 red, white, and green flags, and to think they mean Italy, and not the
 N.U.W.S.S.!‘I went out before dinner last night, and strolled through the quaint
 streets.The whole population was out, and most whole-hearted and
 openly interested in my uniform.‘This is a most delightful window, with all the ships and the colours.There are three men-of-war in, and half a dozen of the quaintest
 little boats, which a soldier told me were “scouts.” I wished I had
 asked a sailor, for I had never heard of “scouts.” The soldier I asked
 is one of the bersaglieri with cock’s feathers, a huge mass of them,
 in his hat.They all say Italy is certainly coming into the war.One
 man on the train to Rome was coming from Cardiff to sell coal to the
 Italian Government.He told us weird stories about German tricks to
 get our coal through Spain and other countries.‘It was a pleasure seeing Royaumont.It is a _huge_ success, and I do
 think Dr.The wards and the theatre,
 and the X-Ray department, and the rooms for mending and cleaning the
 men’s clothes were all perfect.’

_To Mrs.Simson._

      ‘S.W.H., KRAGUJEVATZ,
      _May 30/15_.‘Well, this is a perfectly lovely place, and the Serbians are
 delightful.I am staying with a charming woman, Madame Milanovitz.She
 is a Vice-President of the Serbian Women’s League, formed to help the
 country in time of war.I think she wanted to help us because of all
 the hospital has done here.Any how, _I_ score--I have a beautiful
 room and everything.She gives me an early cup of coffee, and for the
 rest I live with the unit.Neither she nor I can speak six words of
 one another’s languages, but her husband can talk a little French.Now, she has asked the little Serbian lady who teaches the unit
 Serbian, to live with her to interpret.‘We have had a busy time since we arrived.The unit is nursing 550
 beds, in three hospitals, having been sent out to nurse 300 beds.There is first the surgical hospital, called Reserve No.It was a
 school, and is in two blocks with a long courtyard between.I think
 we have got it really quite well equipped, with a fine X-Ray room.The theatre, and the room opposite where the dressings are done, both
 very well arranged, and a great credit to Sister Bozket.The one thing
 that troubled me was the floor--old wood and holes in it, impossible
 to sterilise--but yesterday, Major Protitch, our Director, said he was
 going to get cement laid down in it and the theatre.Chesney, “This is the best surgical hospital
 in Serbia.” You must not believe that _quite_, for they are very good
 at saying pleasant things here!‘There are two other hospitals, the typhus one, No.6 Reserve, and
 one for relapsing fever and general diseases, No.We have put most of our strength in No.6, and it is in
 good working order, but No.7 has had only one doctor, and two day
 Sisters and one night, for over 200 beds.Still it is wonderful what
 those three women have done.We have Austrian prisoners as orderlies
 everywhere, in the hospitals and in the houses.The conglomeration of
 languages is too funny for words--Serbian, German, French, English.Sometimes, you have to get an orderly to translate Serbian into
 German, and another to translate the German into French before you can
 get at what is wanted.Two words we have all learnt, _dotra_, which
 means “good,” and which these grateful people use at once if they
 feel a little better, or are pleased about anything, and the other is
 _boli_, pain--poor men!‘So much for what we _have_ been doing; but the day before
 yesterday we got our orders for a new bit of work.They are forming a
 disinfecting centre at Mladanovatz, and Colonel Grustitch, who is the
 head of the Medical Service here, wants us to go up there at once,
 with our whole fever staff, under canvas.They are giving us the tents
 till ours come out.Typhus is decreasing so much, that No.6 is to be
 turned into a surgical hospital, and there will be only one infectious
 diseases hospital here.I am so pleased at being asked to do this,
 for it is part of a big and well thought out scheme.Alice Hutchison goes to Posheravatz also
 for infectious diseases.I hope she is at Salonika to-day.We really began to think the Governor was going to
 keep her altogether!Her equipment has all come, and yesterday I sent
 Mrs.Smith up to Posheravatz to choose the site and
 pitch the tent.‘They gave me an awfully exciting bit of news in Colonel G.’s office
 yesterday, and that was that five motor cars were in Serbia, north of
 Mladanovatz, for _me_.Of course, I had wired for six, but you have
 been prompt about them.How they got into the north of Serbia I cannot
 imagine, unless they were dropped out of aeroplanes.‘Really, it is wonderful the work this unit has done in the most awful
 stress all through March and April.We ought to be awfully proud of
 them.Soltau a decoration, and Patsy
 Hunter had two medals._To her Niece, Amy M‘Laren._

      ‘VALJEVO, _August 16, 1915_.‘DARLING AMY,--I wonder if you could find this place on the map.I have spelt it properly, but if you want to say it you must say
 _Valuvo_.One of the hospitals mother has been collecting so much
 money for is here.It is in tents,
 on a bit of sloping ground looking south.There are big tents for
 the patients, and little tents for the staff.I pull my bed out
 of the tent every night, and sleep outside under the stars.Such
 lovely starlight nights we have here.Alice Hutchison is head of
 this unit, and I am here on a visit to her.My own hospital is in
 a town--Kragujevatz.Now, I wonder if you can find that place?The
 hospital there is in a girls’ school.Now--I wonder what will happen
 to the lessons of all those little girls as long as the war lasts?Serbia has been at war for three years, four wars in three years, and
 the women of the country have kept the agriculture of the country
 going all that time.A Serbian officer told me the other day that
 the country is so grateful to them, that they are going to strike a
 special medal for the women to show their thanks, when this war is
 over.This is such a beautiful country, and such nice people.Some day
 when the war is over, we’ll come here, and have a holiday.How are you
 getting on, my precious?God bless you,
 dear little girlie.--Ever your loving Aunt

      ELSIE.’

As the fever died out, a worse enemy came in.Serbia was overrun by
the Austro-German forces, and she, with others of her units, was taken
prisoner, as they had decided it was their duty to remain at their work
among the sick and wounded.Again the Serbian Minister is quoted:--

 ‘When the typhus calamity was overcome, the Scottish women reorganised
 themselves as tent hospitals and offered to go as near as possible
 to the army at the front.Their camp in the town of Valjevo--which
 suffered most of all from the Austrian invasion--might have stood
 in the middle of England.In Lazarevatz, shortly before the new
 Austro-German offensive, they formed a surgical hospital almost out
 of nothing, in the devastated shops and the village inns, and they
 accomplished the nursing of hundreds of wounded who poured in from
 the battle-field.When it became obvious that the Serbian army could
 not resist the combined Austrians, Germans, Magyars, and Bulgarians,
 who were about four times their numbers, the main care of the Serbian
 military authorities was what to do with the hospitals full of
 wounded, and whom to leave with the wounded soldiers, who refused to
 be left to fall into the hands of the cruel enemy.Then the Scottish
 women declared that they were not going to leave their patients, and
 that they would stay with them, whatever the conditions, and whatever
 might be expected from the enemy.They remained with the Serbian
 wounded as long as they could be of use to them.Simson._

      ‘KRUSHIEEVATZ, _Nov.‘We are in the very centre of the storm, and it just feels exactly
 like having the rain pouring down, and the wind beating in gusts, and
 not being able to see for the water in one’s eyes, and just holding on
 and saying, “It cannot last, it is so bad.” These poor little people,
 you cannot imagine anything more miserable than they are.Remember,
 they have been fighting for years for their independence, and now it
 all seems to end.Germans, Austrians,
 Bulgars, and all that is left is this western Morava Valley, and
 the country a little south of it.And their big Allies--from here
 it looks as if they are never going to move.I went into Craijuvo
 yesterday, in the car, to see about Dr.The road
 was crowded with refugees pouring away, all their goods piled on
 their rickety ox-wagons, little children on the top, and then bands
 of soldiers, stragglers from the army.These men were forming up
 again, as we passed back later on.We decided we must stand by our hospitals; it was too awful
 leaving badly wounded men with no proper care.Sir Ralph eventually
 agreed, and we gave everybody in the units the choice of going or
 staying.We have about 115 people in the Scottish unit, and twenty
 have gone.Smith brings up the rear-guard to-day, with one or two
 laggards and a wounded English soldier we have had charge of.MacGregor has trekked for Novi Bazaar.It is
 the starting-place for Montenegro.We all managed wonderfully in our
 first “evacuations,” and saved practically everything, but now it is
 hopeless.The bridges are down, and the trucks standing anyhow on
 sidings, and, worst of all, the people have begun looting.There’ll be famine, as well as cold, in this corner of the
 world soon, and then the distant prospect of 150,000 British troops at
 Salonika won’t help much.‘The beloved British troops,--the thought of them always cheers.But
 not the thought of the idiots at the top who had not enough gumption
 to _know_ this must happen.Anybody, even us women, could have told
 them that the Germans must try and break through to the help of the
 Turks.‘We have got a nice building here for a hospital, and Dr.Holloway
 is helping in the military hospital.I believe there are about 1000
 wounded in the place.I can’t write a very interesting letter, Amy
 dear, because at the bottom of my heart I don’t believe it will ever
 reach you.I don’t see them managing the Montenegrin passes at this
 time of year!There is a persistent rumour that the French have
 retaken Skopiro, and if that is true perhaps the Salonika route will
 be open soon.‘Some day, I’ll tell you all the exciting things that have been
 happening, and all the funny things too!For there have been funny
 things, in the middle of all the sadness.The guns are booming away,
 and the country looking so lovely in the sunlight.I wonder if Serbia
 is a particularly beautiful country, or whether it looks so lovely
 because of the tragedy of this war, just as bed seems particularly
 delightful when the night bell goes!’

      ‘SERBIAN MILITARY HOSPITAL,
      ‘KRUSHIEEVATZ, _Nov.‘We have been here about a month.It was dreadfully sad work leaving
 our beautiful little hospital at Krushieevatz.Here, we are working in
 the Serbian military hospital, and living in it also.You can imagine
 that we have plenty to do, when you hear we have 900 wounded.The
 prisoners are brought in every day, sometimes thousands, and go on to
 the north, leaving the sick.The Director has put the sanitation and
 the laundry into our hands also.‘We have had a hard frost for four days now, and snowstorms.My
 warm things did not arrive--I suppose they are safe at Salonika.Fortunately last year’s uniform was still in existence, and I wear
 three pairs of stockings, with my high boots.We have all cut our
 skirts short, for Serbian mud is awful.It is a lovely land, and the
 views round here are very cheering.One sunset I shall never forget--a
 glorious sky, and the hills deep blue against it.In the foreground
 the camp fires, and the prisoners round them in the fading light.’

With the invasion came the question of evacuation.At one time it was
possible the whole of the British unit might escape _via_ Montenegro.Sir Ralph Paget, realising that the equipment could not be saved,
allowed any of the hospital unit who wished to remain with their
wounded.Two parties went with the retreating Serbs, and their story
and the extraordinary hardships they endured has been told elsewhere.Those left at Krushieevatz were in Dr.Inglis’ opinion the fortunate
units.For three months they tended the Serbian wounded under foreign
occupation.Inglis kept to their work, and when
necessary confronted the Austro-German officers with all the audacity
of their leader and the Scottish thistle combined.When we went up
there were 900 patients.During the greatest part of the pressure the
number rose to 1200.Patients were placed in the corridors--at first
one man to one bed, but later two beds together, and three men in them.Then there were no more bedsteads, and mattresses were placed on the
floor.The magazine in full blast was a
sight, once seen, never to be forgotten.There were three tiers,
the slightly wounded men in the highest tier.Inglis says the time to see the place at its
best or its worst was in the gloaming, when two or three feeble oil
lamps illuminated the gloom, and the tin bowls clattered and rattled as
the evening ration of beans was given out, and the men swarmed up and
down the poles of their shelves chattering as Serbs will chatter.The
Sisters called the place ‘the Zoo.’

The dread of the renewal of the typhus scourge, amid such conditions
of overcrowding, underfeeding, fatigue and depression, was great.Inglis details the appalling tasks the unit undertook in sanitation.There was no expert amongst them:--

 ‘When we arrived, the hospital compound was a truly terrible
 place--the sights and smells beyond description.We dug the rubbish
 into the ground, emptied the overflowing cesspool, built incinerators,
 and cleaned, and cleaned, and cleaned.That is an Englishman’s job all
 over the world.Our three untrained English girl orderlies took to it
 like ducks to water.It was not the pleasantest or easiest work in the
 world; but they did it, and did it magnificently.‘Laundry and bathing arrangements were installed and kept going.We
 had not a single case of typhus; we had a greater achievement than
 its prevention.Late of an evening, when men among the prisoners were
 put into the wards, straight from the march, unwashed and crawling
 with lice, there was great indignation among the patients already in.“Doktoritza,” they said, “if you put these dirty men in among us we
 shall all get typhus.” Our hearts rejoiced.If we have done nothing
 else, we thought, we have driven that fact home to the Serbian mind
 that dirt and typhus go together.’

Dr.Inglis describes the misery of the Serbian prisoners:--

 ‘They had seen men go out to battle, conscious of the good work they
 had done for the Allies in driving back the Austrians in their first
 punitive expedition.We are the only ones who, so far, have beaten
 our enemy.They came back to us broken and dispirited.They were
 turned into the hospital grounds, with a scanty ration of beans, with
 a little meat and half a loaf of bread for twenty-four hours.Their
 camp fires flickered fitfully through the long bitter cold nights.Every scrap of wood was torn up, the foot bridges over the drains, and
 the trees hacked down for firewood.We added to the rations of our
 sanitary workers, we gave away all the bread we could, but we could
 not feed that enclosure of hungry men.We used to hear them coughing
 and moaning all night.’

Dr.Inglis details the starving condition of the whole country, the
weakness of the famine-stricken men who worked for them, the starved
yoke oxen, and all the manifold miseries of a country overrun by the
enemy.‘There was,’ she says, ‘a curious exhilaration in working for those
 grateful patient men, and in helping the director, Major Nicolitch, so
 loyal to his country and so conscientious in his work, to bring order
 out of chaos, and yet the unhappiness in the Serbian houses, and the
 physical wretchedness of those cold hungry prisoners lay always like
 a dead weight on our spirit.Never shall we forget the beauty of the
 sunrises, or the glory of the sunsets, with clear, cold sunlit days
 between, and the wonderful starlit nights.But we shall never forget
 “the Zoo” either, or the groans outside the windows when we hid our
 heads under the blankets to shut out the sound.The unit got no news,
 and they made it a point of honour to believe nothing said in the
 German telegrams.We could not believe Serbia had been sacrificed for
 nothing.We were convinced it was some deep laid scheme for weakening
 other fronts, and so it was natural to believe rumours, such as that
 the English had taken Belgium, and the French were in Metz.‘The end of the five months of service in captivity, and to captive
 Serbs ended.On the 11th February 1916, they were sent north under an
 Austrian guard with fixed bayonets, thus to Vienna, and so by slow
 stages they came to Zürich.‘It was a great thing to be once more “home” and to realise how strong
 and straight and fearless a people inhabit these islands: to realise
 not so much that they mean to win the war, but rather that they
 consider any other issue impossible.’

So Dr.Inglis came back to plan new campaigns for the help of the
Serbian people, who lay night and day upon her heart.She knew she had
the backing of the Suffrage societies, and she intended to get the
ear of the English public for the cause of the Allies in the Balkans.‘We,’ who had sent her out, found her changed in many ways.Physically
she had altered much, and if we could ever have thought of the body
in the presence of that dauntless spirit, we might have seen that the
Angel of Shadows was not far away.The privations and sufferings she
described so well when she had to speak of her beloved Serbs had been
fully shared by the unit.Their comfort was always her thought; she
never would have anything that could not be shared and shared alike,
but there was little but hardship to share, and one and all scorned to
speak of privations which were a light affliction compared to those
of a whole nation groaning and waiting to be redeemed from its great
tribulation.There was a look in her face of one whose spirit had been pierced by
the sword.The brightness of her eyes was dimmed, for she had seen the
days when His judgments were abroad upon the earth:--

    ‘Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
    He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are
        stored;
    He has loosed the fatal lightning of His terrible swift sword:
    I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
    They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
    I have read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps.’

She could never forget the tragedy of Serbia, and she came home, not
to rest, but vowed to yet greater endeavours for their welfare.The
attitude of the Allies she did not pretend to understand.She had
something of the spirit of Oliver Cromwell, when he threatened to
send his fleet across the Alps to help the Waldensians.In her public
speeches, when she set forth what in her outlook could have been done,
no censor cut out the sentences which were touched by the live coals
from off her altar of service.Elsie never recognised the word
‘impossible’ for herself, and for her work that was well.As to her
political and military outlook, the story of the nations will find it a
place in the history of the war.For a few months she worked from the bases of her two loyal
Committees in London and Edinburgh.She spoke at many a public meeting,
and filled many a drawing-room.The Church of Scotland knew her
presence in London.‘One of our most treasured memories will be that
keen, clever face of hers in St.Columba’s of a Sunday--with the far,
wistful melancholy in it, added to its firm determination.’ So writes
the minister.‘We’ knew what lay behind the wistful brave eyes, a yet
more complete dedication to the service of her Serbian brethren.CHAPTER X

RUSSIA

1917

    ‘Even so in our mortal journey,
      The bitter north winds blow,
    And thus upon life’s red river,
      Our hearts as oarsmen row.And when the Angel of Shadow
      Rests his feet on wave and shore,
    And our eyes grow dim with watching,
      And our hearts faint at the oar,

    Happy is he who heareth
      The signal of his release
    In the bells of the holy city
      The chimes of eternal peace.’


Dr.Inglis’ return to England was the signal for renewed efforts
on the part of the Committees managing the S.W.H.This memoir has
necessarily to follow the personality of the leader, but it must never
be forgotten that her strength and all her sinews of war lay in the
work of those who carried on at home, week by week.Strong committees
of women, ably organised and thoroughly staffed, took over the burden
of finance--a matter Dr.Inglis once amusingly said, ‘did not interest
her.’ They found and selected the _personnel_ on which success so much
depended, they contracted for and supervised the sending out of immense
consignments of equipment and motor transport.They dealt with the
Government department, and in loyal devotion smoothed every possible
obstacle out of the path of those flying squadrons, the units of the
S.W.H.It was inevitable the quick brain and tenacious energy of Dr.Inglis,
far away from the base of her operations, should at times have found
it hard to understand why the wheels occasionally seemed to drag, and
the new effort she desired to make did not move at the pace which to
her eager spirit seemed possible.Two enterprises filled her mind on
her return in 1916.One, by the help of the London Committee, she put
through.This was the celebration of Kossovo Day in Great Britain.The flag-day of the Serbian Patriot King was under her chairmanship
prepared for in six weeks.Hundreds of lectures on the history of
Serbia were arranged for and delivered throughout the country, and no
one failed to do her work, however remote they might think the prospect
of making the British people interested in a country and patriot so far
from the ken of their island isolation.Kossovo Day was a success, and through the rush of the work Dr.Inglis
was planning the last and most arduous of all the undertakings of the
S.W.H., that of the unit which was to serve with the Serbian Volunteers
on the Rumanian Russian front.Inglis knew from private sources the
lack of hospital arrangements in Mesopotamia, and she, with the backing
of the Committees, had approached the authorities for leave to take a
fully equipped unit to Basra.When the story of the Scottish Women’s
Hospital is written, the correspondence between the War Office, the
Foreign Office, and S.W.H.will throw a tragic light on this lamentable
episode, and, read with the report of the Committees, it will prove how
quick and foreseeing of trouble was her outlook.Inglis
brought her units back from Serbia, she again urged the War Office to
send her out.Of her treatment by the War Office, Mrs.Fawcett writes:
‘She was not only refused, but refused with contumely and insult.’

True to her instinct never to pause over a set-back, she lost no time
in pressing on her last enterprise for the Serbians.M. Curcin, in _The
Englishwoman_, says:--

 ‘She was already acquainted with one side of the Serbian
 problem--Serbia; she was told that in Russia there was the best
 opportunity to learn about the second half--the Serbs of Austria, the
 Jugoslavs.Inglis succeeded in raising a hospital
 unit and transport section staffed by eighty women heroes of the
 Scottish Women’s Hospitals to start with her on a most adventurous
 undertaking, _via_ Archangel, through Russia to Odessa and the
 Dobrudja.Inglis succeeded also--most difficult of all--in
 getting permission from the British authorities for the journey.Eye-witnesses--officers and soldiers--tell everybody to-day how those
 women descended, practically straight from the railway carriages,
 after forty days’ travelling, beside the stretchers with wounded,
 and helped to dress the wounds of those who had had to defend the
 centre and also a wing of the retreating army.For fifteen months she
 remained with those men, whose _rôle_ is not yet fully realised, but
 is certain to become one of the most wonderful and characteristic
 facts of the conflagration of nations.’

The Edinburgh Committee had already so many undertakings on behalf of
the S.W.H.that they gladly allowed the Committee formed by the London
Branch of the N.U.W.S.S.to undertake the whole work of organising this
last adventure for the Serbian Army.Inglis and her unit sailed the wintry main, and to them she sent
the voluminous and brilliant reports of her work.When the Russian
revolution imperilled the safety of the Serbian Army on the Rumanian
front, she sent home members of her unit, charged with important
verbal messages to her Government.Through the last anxious month,
when communications were cut off, short messages, unmistakably her
own, came back to the London Committee, that they might order her to
return.She would come with the Serbian Army and not without them.We
at home had to rest on the assurances of the Foreign Office, always
alive to the care and encouragement of the S.W.H., that Dr.Inglis and
her unit were safe, and that their return would be expedited at the
safest hour.In those assurances we learnt to rest, and the British
Government did not fail that allied force--the Serbian Army and the
Scottish women serving them.The following letters were those written
to her family with notes from her graphic report to her Committees.The
clear style and beautiful handwriting never changed even in those last
days, when those who were with her knew that nothing but the spirit
kept the wasted body at its work.‘The Serbian Division is superb; we
are proud to be attached to it.’ These were the last words in her last
letter from Odessa in June 1917.That pride of service runs through
all the correspondence.The spirit she inspired is noteworthy in a
book which covers the greater part of these fifteen months, _With the
Scottish Nurses in Rumania_, by Yvonne Fitzroy.In a daily diary a
searchlight is allowed to fall on some of the experiences borne with
such high-hearted nonchalance by the leader and her gallant disciples.Haverfield, who saw her work, writes:

 ‘It was perfectly incredible that one human being could do the work
 she accomplished.Her record piece of work perhaps was at Galatz,
 Rumania, at the end of the retreat.There were masses and masses of
 wounded, and she and her doctors and nurses performed operations and
 dressings for fifty-eight hours out of sixty-three.Scott, of the
 armoured cars, noted the time, and when he told her how long she had
 been working, she simply said, “Well, it was all due to Mrs.Milne,
 the cook, who kept us supplied with hot soup.” She had been very
 tired for a long time; undoubtedly the lack of food, the necessity of
 sleeping on the floor, and nursing her patients all the time told on
 her health.In Russia she was getting gradually more tired until she
 became ill.When she was the least bit better she was up again, and
 all the time she attended to the business of the unit.‘Just before getting home she had a relapse, and the last two or
 three days on board ship, we know now, she was dying.She made all the
 arrangements for the unit which she brought with her, however, and
 interviewed every member of it.To Miss Onslow, her transport officer,
 she said, when she arrived at Newcastle, “I shall be up in London in a
 few days’ time, and we will talk the matter of a new unit over.” Miss
 Onslow turned away with tears in her eyes.’

      ‘H.M.TRANSPORT ----,
      ‘_Sep.‘DEAREST AMY,--Here we are more than half way through our voyage.We
 got off eventually on Wednesday night, and lay all Thursday in the
 river.You never in your life saw such a filthy boat as this was when
 we came on board.The captain had been taken off an American liner the
 day before.The only officer who had been on this boat before was the
 engineer officer.The crew were drunk to a man,
 and, as the Transport officer said, “The only way to get this ship
 right, is to get her _out_.” So we got out.I must say we got into
 shape very quickly.We cleaned up, and now we are painting.They won’t
 know her when she gets back.She is an Austrian Lloyd captured at the
 beginning of the war, and she has been trooping in the Mediterranean
 since.She was up at Glasgow for this new start, but she struck the
 Glasgow Fair, and could therefore get nothing done, so she was brought
 down to the port we started from--as she was.The captain seems to be an awfully good man.He is Scotch,
 and was on the Anchor Line to Bombay.She has all our equipment, fourteen of our cars.For passengers,
 there are ourselves, seventy-five people, and three Serbian officers,
 and the mother and sister of one of them, and thirty-two Serbian
 non-commissioned officers.On the saloon deck there are
 twenty-two very small, single cabins.And on this deck larger cabins
 with either three or four berths.I am on this deck in the most
 luxurious quarters.It is called _The Commanding Officer’s Cabin_
 (ahem).There is a huge cabin with one berth; off it on one side
 another cabin with a writing-table and sofa, and off it on the other
 side a bathroom and dressing-room!Of course, if we had had rough
 weather, and the ports had had to be closed, it would not have been so
 nice, especially as the glass in all the portholes is blackened, but
 we have had perfectly glorious weather.At night every porthole and
 window is closed to shut in the light, but the whole ship is very well
 ventilated.A good many of them sleep up in the boats, or in one of
 the lorries.‘We sighted one submarine, but it took no notice of us, so we took
 no notice of it.We had all our boats allotted to us the very first
 day.We divided the unit among them, putting one responsible person
 in charge of each, and had boat drill several times.Then one day the
 captain sounded the alarm for practice, and everybody was at their
 station in three minutes in greatcoat and life-belt.The amusing
 thing was that some of them thought it was a real alarm, and were
 most annoyed and disappointed to find there was not a submarine
 really there!The unit as a whole seems very nice and capable, though
 there are one or two queer characters!But most of them are healthy,
 wholesome bricks of girls.Of course
 a field hospital is quite a new bit of work.‘We reach our port of disembarkation this afternoon.The voyage
 has been a most pleasant one in every way.As soon as sea-sickness
 was over the unit developed a tremendous amount of energy, and we
 have had games on deck, and concerts, and sports, and a fancy dress
 competition!All this in addition to drill every morning, which was
 compulsory.‘We began the day at 8.30--breakfast, the cabins were tidied.9.30--roll call and cabin inspection immediately after; then
 drill--ordinary drill, stretcher drill, and Swedish drill in sections.Lunch was at 12.30, and then there were lessons in Russian, Serbian,
 and French, to which they could go if they liked, and most of them
 took one, or even two, and lectures on motor construction, etc.Tea at
 4, and dinner 6.30.You would have thought there was not much time for
 anything else, but the superfluous energy of a British unit manages
 to put a good deal more in.(The head of a British unit in Serbia
 once said to me that the chief duty of the head of a British unit was
 to use up the superfluous energy of the unit in harmless ways.He
 said that the only time there was no superfluous energy was when the
 unit was overworking.That was the time I found that particular unit
 playing rounders!)I was standing next
 to a Serb officer during the obstacle race, and he suddenly turned to
 me and said, “C’est tout-à-fait nouveau pour nous, Madame.” I thought
 it must be, for at that moment they were getting under a sail which
 had been tied down to the deck--two of them hurled themselves on the
 sail and dived under it, you saw four legs kicking wildly, and then
 the sail heaved and fell, and two dishevelled creatures emerged at the
 other side, and tore at two life-belts which they went through, and so
 on.I should think it was indeed _tout-à-fait nouveau_.Some of the
 dresses at the fancy dress competition were most clever.There was
 Napoleon--the last phase, in the captain’s long coat and somebody’s
 epaulettes, and one of our grey hats, side to the front, excellent;
 and Tweedledum and Tweedledee, in saucepans and life-belts.One of
 them got herself up as a “greaser,” and went down to the engine-room
 to get properly dirty, with such successful result that, when she was
 coming up to the saloon, with her little oiling can in her hand, one
 of the officers stopped her with, “Now, where are you going to, my
 lad?”

 ‘We ended up with all the allied National Anthems, the Serbs leading
 their own.‘I do love to see them enjoying themselves, and to hear them
 chattering and laughing along the passages, for they’ll have plenty
 of hard work later.We had service on Sunday, which I took, as
 the captain could not come down.Could you get us some copies of
 the Archbishop of Canterbury’s war prayers?The captain declares he was snap-shotted six times
 one morning.I don’t know if the Russian Government will let us take
 all these cameras with us.We are flying the Union Jack for the first
 time to-day since we came out.It is good to know you are all thinking
 of us.--Ever your loving sister,

      ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

      ‘ON THE TRAIN TO MOSCOW,
      ‘_Sep.‘DEAREST AMY,--Here we are well on our way to Moscow, having got
 through Archangel in 2½ days--a feat, for we were told at home that it
 might be six weeks.They did not know that there is a party of our
 naval men there helping the Russians, and Archangel is magnificently
 organised now.‘When one realises that the population was 5000 before the war,
 and is now 20,000, it is quite clear there was bound to be some
 disorganisation at first.‘I never met a kinder set of people than are collected at Archangel
 just now.They simply did everything for us, and sent us off in a
 train with a berth for each person, and gave us a wonderful send off.The Russian Admiral gave us a letter which acts as a kind of magic
 ring whenever it is produced.The first time it was really quite
 startling.We were longing for Nyamdonia where we were to get dinner.We were told we should be there at four o’clock, then at five, and
 at six o’clock we pulled up at a place unknown, and rumours began
 to spread that our engine was off, and sure enough it was, and was
 shunting trucks.Miss Little, one of our Russian-speaking people,
 and I got out.We tried our united eloquence, she in fluent Russian,
 and I saying, _Shechaz_, which means “immediately” at intervals, and
 still they looked helpless and said, “Two hours and a half.” Then I
 produced my letter, and you never saw such a change.They said, “Five
 minutes,” and we were off in three.We tried it all along the line
 after that; my own belief is that we should still be at the unknown
 place, without that letter, shunting trucks.At one station, Miss
 Little heard the station-master saying, “There is a great row going
 on here, and there will be trouble to-morrow if this train isn’t got
 through.” Eventually, we reached Nyamdonia at 11.30, and found a
 delightful Russian officer, and an excellent dinner paid for by the
 Russian Government, waiting for us.We all thought the food very good,
 and I thought the sauce of hunger helped.The next day, profiting
 over our Nyamdonia experience, I said meals were to be had at regular
 times from our stores in the train, and we should take the restaurants
 as we found them, with the result that we arrived at Vorega, where
 _déjeuner_ had been ordered just as we finished a solid lunch of ham
 and eggs.I said they had better go out and have two more courses,
 which they did with great content, and found it quite as nice as the
 night before.‘This is a special train for us and the Serbian officers and
 non-coms.We broke a coupling after we left Nyamdonia, and they sent
 out another carriage from there, but it had not top berths, so they
 had another sleeper ready when we reached Vologda.They gave us
 another and stronger engine at Nyamdonia, because we asked for it, and
 have repaired cisterns, and given us chickens and eggs; and when we
 thank them, they say, “It is for our friends.” The crowd stand round
 three deep while we eat, and watch us all the time, quite silently in
 the stations.In Archangel one old man asked, “Who, on God’s earth,
 are you?”

 ‘They gave us such a send-off from Archangel!Russian soldiers were
 drawn up between the ship and the train, and cheered us the whole way,
 with a regular British cheer; our own crew turned out with a drum
 and a fife and various other instruments, and marched about singing.Then they made speeches, and cheered everybody, and then suddenly the
 Russian soldiers seized the Serbian officers and tossed them up and
 down, up and down, till they were stopped by a whistle.But they had
 got into the mood by then, and they rushed at me.You can imagine, I
 fled, and seized hold of the British Consul.I did think the British
 Empire would stand by me, but he would do nothing but laugh.And I
 found myself up in the air above the crowd, up and down, quite safe,
 hands under one and round one.They were so happy that I waved my hand
 to them, and they shouted and cheered.The unit is only annoyed that
 they had not their cameras, and that anyhow it was dark.Then they
 tossed Captain Bevan, who is in command there, because he was English,
 and the Consul for the same reason, and the captain of the transport
 because he had brought us out.We sang all the national anthems, and
 then they danced for us.It was a weird sight in the moonlight.Some
 of the dances were like Indian ones, and some reminded me of our
 Highland flings.We went on till one in the morning--all the British
 colony, there.I confess, I was tired--though I did enjoy it.Captain
 Bevan’s good-bye was the nicest and so unexpected--simply “God bless
 you.” Mrs.Young, the Consul’s wife, Mrs.Kerr, both Russians, simply
 gave up their whole time to us, took the girls about, and Mrs.Kerr
 had _the whole unit_ to tea.I had lunch one day at the British Mess,
 and another day at the Russian Admiral’s.They all came out to dinner
 with us.‘Of course a new face means a lot in an out-of-the-way place, and
 seventy-five new faces was a God-send.Well, as I said before, they
 are the kindest set of people I ever came across.They brought us our
 bread, and changed our money, and arranged with the bank, and got us
 this train with berths, and thought of every single thing for us.‘NEARING ODESSA,
      ‘_Sep.‘DARLING EVE,--We are nearing the second stage of our journey, and
 _they say_ we shall be in Odessa to-night.We have all come to the
 conclusion that a Russian minute is about ten times as long as ours.If we get in to-night we shall have taken nine days from Archangel;
 with all the lines blocked with military trains, that is not bad.All the same we have had some struggles, but it has been a very
 comfortable journey and very pleasant.The Russian officials all along
 the line have been most helpful and kind.A Serbian officer on board,
 or rather a Montenegrin, looked after us like a father.‘What we should have done without M. and Mme.Malinina at Moscow, I
 don’t know.They gave the whole afternoon up to us: took us to the
 Kremlin--he, the whole unit on special tramcars, and she, three of
 us in her motor.She has a beautiful
 hospital, a clearing one at the station, and he is a member of the
 Duma, and Commandant of all the Red Cross work in Moscow.We only had
 a glimpse of the Kremlin, yet enough to make one want to see more.I
 carried away one beautiful picture to remember--the view of Moscow in
 the sunset light, simply gorgeous.‘The unit are very very well, and exceedingly cheerful.I am not
 sorry to have had these three weeks since we left to get the unit in
 hand.When M. Malinina said it was
 time to leave the Kremlin, and the order was given to “Fall in,” I was
 quite proud of them, they did it so quickly.It is wonderful even now
 what they manage to do.Miss H. says they are like eels in a basket.They were told not to eat fruit without peeling it, so one of them
 peeled an apple with her teeth.They were told not to drink unboiled
 water, so they handed their water-bottles out at dead of night to
 Russian soldiers, to whom they could not explain, to fill for them,
 as of course they understood they were not to fill them from water on
 the train.I must say they are an awfully nice lot on the whole.We
 certainly shall not fail for want of energy.The Russian crowds are
 tremendously interested in them.--Ever your loving aunt,

      ‘ELSIE.’

      ‘RENI, _Sep.‘DEAREST AMY,--We have left Odessa and are really off to our
 Division.We were told this is the important point in the war
 just now--“A Second Verdun.” The great General Mackensen is in command
 against us.He was in command at Krushinjevatz when we were taken
 prisoners.Every one says how anxiously they are looking out for us,
 and, indeed, we shall have our work cut out for us.We are two little
 field hospitals for a whole Division.Think if that was the provision
 for our own men.We saw the
 2nd Division preparing in Odessa.Only from the point of view of the
 war, they ought to be looked after, but when one remembers that they
 are men, every one of them with somebody who cares for them, it is
 dreadful.I wish we were each six women instead of one.I have wired
 home for another Base Hospital to take the place of the British Red
 Cross units when they move on with the 2nd Division.The Russians are
 splendid in taking the Serbs into their Base Hospitals, but you can
 imagine what the pressure is from their own huge armies.We had such
 a reception at Odessa.All the Russian officials, at the station, and
 our Consul, and a line drawn up of twenty Serbian officers.They had
 a motor car and forty droskies and a squad of Serbian soldiers to
 carry up our personal luggage, and most delightful quarters for us on
 the outskirts of the town in a sanatorium.We were the guests of the
 city while we were there.Odessa
 is immensely interested in us.We were told that the form of greeting
 while we were there was, “Have you seen _them_?” The two best things
 were the evening at the Serbian Mess, and the gala performance at the
 opera.The cheering of the Serbian mess when we went in was something
 to remember, but I can tell you I felt quite choking when the whole
 house last night turned round and cheered us after we tried to sing
 our National Anthem to them with the orchestra.‘DEAREST AMY,--Just a line to say I am all right.Four weeks to-morrow
 since we reached Medgidia, and began our hospital.We evacuated it in
 three weeks, and here we are all back on the frontier.Such a time it
 has been, Amy dear.You cannot imagine what war is just behind the
 lines, and in a retreat!--our second retreat, and almost to the same
 day.We evacuated Kragujevatz on the 25th of October last year.We
 evacuated Medgidia on the 22nd this year.On the 25th this year, we
 were working in a Russian dressing-station at Harshova, and were moved
 on in the evening.We arrived at Braila to find 11,000 wounded, and
 seven doctors--only one of them a surgeon.Am going back to Braila to do surgery.Have
 sent every trained person there.--Your loving sister,

      ELSIE.‘_P.S._--We have had lots of exciting things too, and amusing things,
 and _good_ things.’

      ‘ON THE DANUBE AT TULCEA,
      ‘_Nov.‘DEAREST AMY,--I am writing this on the boat between Tulcea and
 Ismail, where I am going to see our second hospital and the transport.Admiral Vesolskin has given me a special boat, and we motored over
 from Braila.The Étappen command had been expecting us all afternoon,
 and the boat was ready.They were very amused to find that “the
 doctor” they had been expecting was a _woman_!‘Our main hospital was at Medgidia, and our field hospital at
 Bulbulmic, only about seven miles from the front.They gave us a
 very nice building, a barrack, at Medgidia for the hospital, and the
 _personnel_ were in tents on the opposite hill.We arrived on the
 day of the offensive, and were ready for patients within forty-eight
 hours.We were there less than three weeks, and during that time we
 unpacked the equipment and repacked it.We made really a rather nice
 hospital at Medgidia, and the field hospital.We pitched and struck
 the camp--we were nursing and operating the whole time, and evacuating
 rapidly too, and our cars were on the road practically always.‘The first notice we got of the retreat was our field hospital being
 brought back five versts.Then we were told to
 send the equipment to Galatz, but to keep essential things and the
 _personnel_.The whole country was covered with
 groups of soldiers who had lost their regiments.Russians, Serbs, and
 Rumanians.The Rumanian guns were simply being rushed back, through
 the crowds of refugees.The whole country was moving: in some places
 the panic was awful.One part of our scattered unit came in for it.You would have thought the Bulgars were at the heels of the people.One man threw away a baby right in front of the cars.They were
 throwing everything off the carts to lighten them, and our people,
 being of a calmer disposition, picked up what they wanted in the way
 of vegetables, etc.Men, with their rifles and bayonets, climbed on
 to the Red Cross cars to save a few minutes.We simply went head
 over heels out of the country.I want to collect all the different
 stories of our groups.My special lot slept the first night on straw
 in Caromacat; the next night on the roadside round a lovely fire; the
 next (much reduced in numbers, for I had cleared the majority off in
 barges for Galatz), we slept in an empty room at Hershova, and spent
 the next day dressing at the wharf.And by the next night we were in
 Braila, involved in the avalanche of wounded that descended on that
 place, and there we have been ever since.‘We found some of our transport, and, while we were having tea, an
 officer came in and asked us to go round and help in a hospital.There, we were told, there were 11,000 wounded (I believe the official
 figures are 7000).They had been working thirty-six hours without
 stopping when we arrived.‘The wounded had overflowed into empty houses, and were lying about in
 their uniforms, and their wounds not dressed for four or five days.‘So we just turned up our sleeves and went in.I got back all the
 trained Sisters from Galatz, and now the pressure is over.One thing
 I am going up to Ismail for, is to get into touch with the Serbian H.2, and find out what they want us to do next.The Serb wounded were
 evacuated straight to Odessa.‘The unit as a whole has behaved splendidly, plucky and cheery through
 everything, and game for any amount of work.‘And we are prouder of our Serbs than ever.I do hope the papers at
 home have realised what the 1st Division did, and how they suffered in
 the fight in the middle of September.General Genlikoffsky said to me,
 “_C’était magnifique, magnifique!Ils sont les héros_”;--and another
 Russian: “We did not quite believe in these Austrian Serbs, but no one
 will ever doubt them again.”

 ‘Personally, I have been awfully well, and prouder than ever of
 British women.I wish you could have seen trained Sisters scrubbing
 floors at Medgidia, and those strapping transport girls lifting the
 stretchers out of the ambulances so steadily and gently.I have told
 in the Report how Miss Borrowman and Miss Brown brought the equipments
 through to Galatz.We lost only one Ludgate boiler and one box of
 radiators.We lost two cars, but that was really the fault of a rather
 stupid Serbian officer.It is a comfort to feel you are all thinking
 of us.--Your loving sister,

      ‘E.I.’

      ‘IN AN AMBULANCE TRAIN BETWEEN
      ‘RENI AND ODESSA, _Jan.‘DARLING EVE,--Now we have got a hospital at Reni again, for badly
 wounded, working in connection with the evacuation station.We have
 got the dearest little house to live in ourselves, but, as we are
 getting far more people out from Odessa, we shall have to overflow
 into the Expedition houses.I
 remember thinking Reni a most uninteresting place--crowds of shipping
 and the wharf all crammed with sacks.It was just a big junction like
 Crewe!‘The hospital at Reni is a real building, but it is not finished.One
 unfinished bit is the windows, which have one layer of glass each,
 though they have double sashes.When this was pointed out, I thought
 it was a mere continental foible.When the cold came I realised
 that there is some sense in this foible after all!We _cannot_ get
 the wards warm, notwithstanding extra stoves and roaring fires.The
 poor Russians do mind cold so much.But they don’t want to leave the
 hospital.One man whom I told he must have an operation later on in
 another hospital, said he would rather wait for it in ours.The first
 time we had to evacuate, we simply could not get the men to go.‘We have got a Russian Secretary now, because we are using Russian
 Red Cross money, and he told us he had been told in Petrograd that
 the S.W.H.were beautifully organised, and the only drawback was
 the language.We have got a
 certain number of Austrian prisoners as orderlies, and most of them
 curiously can speak Russian, so we get on better.This is a most comfortable
 way of travelling, and the quickest.We have 500 wounded on board,
 twenty-three of them ours.I am going to Odessa to find out why we
 cannot get Serb patients.There are still thousands of them in Odessa,
 and yet Dr.The Serbs we meet seem
 to think it is somehow our fault!I tell them I have written and
 telegraphed, and planned and made two journeys to Ismail, to try and
 get a real Serbian Hospital going, and yet it doesn’t go.‘What did happen over the change of Government?I do hope we have got
 the right lot now, to put things straight at home, and carry through
 things abroad.Remember it all depends on you people at home._The
 whole thing depends on us._ I know we lose the perspective in this
 gloomy corner, but there is one thing quite clear, and that is that
 they are all trusting to our _sticking_ powers.They know we’ll hold
 on--of course--I only wish we would realise that it would be as well
 to use our intellects too, and have them clear of alcohol.’

      ‘IN AN AMBULANCE TRAIN,
      ‘NEAR ODESSA, _Jan.‘You don’t know what a comfort it is on this tumultuous front, to
 know that all you people at home have just settled down to it, and
 that you’ll put things right in the long run.It is curious to feel
 how everybody is trusting to that.The day we left Braila, a Rumanian
 said to me in the hall, “It is England we are trusting to.She has
 got hold now like a strong dog!” But it is a bigger job than any of
 you imagine, _I_ think.But there is not the slightest doubt we shall
 pull it off.I am glad to think the country has discovered that it is
 possible to have an alternative Government.If it does not do, we must
 find yet another._To her little Niece, Amy M‘Laren_

      ‘ON AN AMBULANCE TRAIN,
      ‘NEAR ODESSA, _Jan.‘DARLING AMY,--How are you all?We have been very busy since we came
 out here: first a hospital for the Serbs at Medgidia, then in a
 Rumanian hospital at Braila, and then for the Russians at Galatz and
 Reni.In the very middle, by some funny mistake, we were sent flying
 right on to the front line.However we nipped out again just in time,
 and the station was burnt to the ground just half an hour after we
 left.I’ll tell you the name of the place when the war is over, and
 show it to you on the map.We saw the petrol tanks on fire as we came
 away, and the ricks of grain too.‘Our hospital at Galatz was in a school.I don’t think the children
 in these parts are doing many lessons during the war, and that will
 be a great handicap for their countries afterwards.Perhaps, however,
 they are learning other lessons.When we left the Dobrudja we saw the
 crowds of refugees on their carts, with the things they had been able
 to save, and all the little children packed in among the furniture and
 pots and pans and pigs.‘In one cart I saw two fascinating babies about three years old,
 sitting in a kind of little nest made of pillows and rugs.They were
 little girls, one fair and one dark, and they sat there, as good as
 gold, watching everything with such interest.There were streams of
 carts along the roads, and all the villages deserted.That is what
 the war means out here.It is not quite so bad in our safe Scotland,
 is it?--thanks to the fleet.And that is why it seems to me we have
 got to help these people, because they are having the worst of it.I wonder if you can knit socks yet, for I can use any number, and
 bandages.Blessings on you, precious
 little girl.--Your loving aunt,

      ELSIE.’

 ‘I have had my meals with the Staff.Unfortunately, most of them
 speak only Russian, but one man speaks French, and another German.The man who speaks German is
 having English lessons from her.He picked up _Punch_ and showed _me_ YOU.So, I said “you.”
 He repeated it quite nicely, and then found another OU.“Though,”
 and when I said “though,” he flung up his hands, and said, “Why a
 practical nation like the English should do things like this!”’

      ‘S.W.H.,
      RENI, _March 5, 1917_.‘DARLING MARY,--We have been having such icy weather here, such
 snowstorms sweeping across the plain.One day I really thought the house would be cut off from the hospital.The unit going over to Roll was quite a sight, with the indiarubber
 boots, and peaked Russian caps, with the ends twisted round their
 throats.We should have thoroughly enjoyed it if it had not been for
 the shortage of fuel.However, we were never absolutely without wood,
 and now have plenty, as a Cossack regiment sent a squad of men across
 the Danube to cut for us, and we brought it back in our carts.The
 Danube is frozen right across--such a curious sight.The first time in
 seven years, they say--so nice of it to do it just when we are here!I
 would not have missed it for anything.The hospital has only had about
 forty patients for some time, as there has been no fighting, and it
 was just as well when we were so short of wood.We collected them all
 into one ward, and let the other fires out.‘The chief of the medical department held an inspection.Took off the
 men’s shirts and looked for lice, turned up the sheets, and beat the
 mattresses to look for dust, tasted the men’s food, and in the end
 stated we were _ochin chesté_ (very clean), and that the patients
 were well cared for medically and well nursed.All of which was
 very satisfactory, but he added that the condition of the orderlies
 was disgraceful, and so it was.I hadn’t realised they were my job.However, I told him next time he came he should not find one single
 louse.Laird and I have a nice snug little room together.That is one
 blessing here, we have plenty of sun.Very soon it will begin to get
 quite hot.I woke up on the 1st of March and thought of getting home
 last year that day, and two days after waking up in Eve’s dear little
 room, with the roses on the roof.Bless all you dear people.--Ever
 your loving aunt,

      ‘ELSIE.’

      ‘_March 23, 1917._

 ‘We have been awfully excited and interested in the news from
 Petrograd.We heard of it, probably long after you people at home
 knew all about it!It is most interesting to see how everybody is on
 the side of the change, from Russian officers, who come to tea and
 beam at us, and say, “Heresho” (good) to the men in the wards.In any
 case they say we shall find the difference all over the war area.One
 Russian officer, who was here before the news came, was talking about
 the Revolution in England two hundred years ago, and said it was the
 most interesting period of European history.“They say all these ideas
 began with the French Revolution, but they didn’t--they began long
 before in England,” he thought.He spoke English beautifully, and had
 had an English nurse.He had read Milton’s political pamphlets, and
 we wondered all the time whether he was thinking of changes in Russia
 after the war, but now I wonder if he knew the changes were coming
 sooner.‘Do you know we have all been given the St.Prince
 Dolgourokoff, who is in command on this front, arrived quite
 unexpectedly, just after roll call.The telegram saying he was coming
 arrived a quarter of an hour after he left!General Kropensky, the
 head of the Red Cross, rushed up, and the Prince arrived about two
 minutes after him.He went all over the hospital, and a member of
 his gilded staff told matron he was very pleased with everything.He decorated two men in the wards with St.George’s Medal, and then
 said he wanted to see us together, and shook hands with everybody and
 said, “Thank you,” and gave each of us a medal too; Dr.Laird’s was
 for service, as she had not been under fire.George’s Medal is a
 silver one with “For Bravery” on its back.Our patients were awfully
 pleased, and inpressed on us that it carried with it a pension of a
 rouble a month for life.We gave them all cigarettes to commemorate
 the occasion.‘It was rather satisfactory to see how the hospital looked in its
 ordinary, and even I was _fairly_ satisfied.I tell the unit that
 they must remember that they have an old maid as commandant, and must
 live up to it!I cannot stand dirt, and crooked charts and crumpled
 sheets.One Sister, I hear, put it delightfully in a letter home: “Our
 C.M.O.is an idealist!” I thought that was rather sweet; I believe she
 added, “but she does appreciate good work.” Certainly, I appreciate
 hers.She is in charge of the room for dressings, and it is one of the
 thoroughly satisfactory points in the hospital.‘The Greek priest came yesterday to bless the hospital.We put up
 “Icons” in each of the four wards.The Russians are a very religious
 people, and it seems to appeal to some mystic sense in them.The
 priest just put on a stole, green and gold, and came in his long grey
 cloak.The two wards open out of one another, so he held the service
 in one, the men all saying the responses and crossing themselves.The
 four icons lay on the table before him, with three lighted candles at
 the inner comers, and he blessed water and sprinkled them, and then he
 sprinkled everybody in the room.The icons were fixed up in the corner
 of the wards, and I bought little lamps to burn in front of them, as
 they always have them.We are going to have the evening hymn sung
 every evening at six o’clock.I heard that first in Serbia from those
 poor Russian prisoners, who sang it regularly every evening.The night nurses come up from the
 village literally wet through, having dragged one another out of mud
 holes all the way.Now, a cart goes down to fetch them each evening.We have twenty horses and nine carts belonging to us.I have made Vera
 Holme master of the horse.‘I have heard two delightful stories from the Sisters who have
 returned from Odessa.There is a great rivalry between the Armoured
 Car men and the British Red Cross men, about the capabilities of
 their Sisters.(We, it appears, are the Armoured Car Sisters!)man said their Sisters were so smart they got a man on to the
 operating-table five minutes after the other one went off.Said an
 Armoured Car man: “But that’s nothing.The Scottish Sisters get the
 second one on before the first one is off.” The other story runs that
 there was some idea of the men waiting all night on a quay, and the
 men said, “But you don’t think we are Scottish Sisters, sir, do you?”
 I have no doubt that refers to Galatz, where we made them work all
 night.’

      ‘RENI, _Easter Day, 1917_.‘We, all the patients, sick and wounded, belonging to the Army and
 Navy, and coming from different parts of the great, free Russia, who
 are at present in your hospital, are filled with feelings of the
 truest respect for you.We think it our duty as citizens on this
 beautiful day of Holy Easter to express to you, highly respected and
 much beloved Doctor, as well as to your whole Unit, our best thanks
 for all the care and attention you have bestowed upon us.We bow low
 and very respectfully before the constant and useful work which we
 have seen daily, and which we know to be for the well-being of our
 allied countries.‘We are quite sure that, thanks to the complete unity of action of
 all the allied countries, the hour of gladness and the triumph of the
 Allied arms in the cause of humanity and the honour of nations is near.‘_Vive l’Angleterre!_

      ‘Russian Soldiers, Citizens, and the Russian Sister,
      ’VERA V. DE KOLESNIKOFF.’

      ‘RENI, _March 2, 1917_.‘DARLING EVE,--Very many thanks for the war prayers.The Archbishop’s prayers that I wanted are the
 original ones at the beginning of the war.Just at present we are
 very lucky as regards the singing, as there are three or four capital
 voices in the unit.We have the service at 1.30 on Sunday.That lets
 all the morning work be finished.I do wonder what has become of Miss
 Henderson and the new orderlies!We want them all
 so badly, not to speak of my cool uniform.That will be needed very
 soon I think.We are having
 glorious weather, so sunny and warm.All the snow has gone, and the
 mud is appalling.I thought I knew the worst mud could do in Serbia,
 but it was nothing to this.We have made little tiled paths all about
 our domain, and keep comparatively clean there.I wish we could take
 over the lot of buildings.The other day I thought I had made a great
 score, and bought two thousand poud of wood at a very small price.It
 was thirty-five versts out.We got the Cossacks to lend us transport.But the transport stuck in the mud, and came back the next day, having
 had to haul the empty carts out of mud holes by harnessing four horses
 first to one cart and then to another.It was no wonder I got the wood
 so cheap.‘_April 18, 1918._

 ‘I am writing this sitting out in my little tent, with a glorious
 view over the Danube.We have pitched some of the tents to relieve
 the crowding in the house.They are no longer beautiful and white, as
 they were at Medgidia.We have had to stain them a dirty grey colour,
 so as to hide them from aeroplanes.Yesterday, we had an awful gale,
 and a downpour of rain, and the tents stood splendidly, and not a
 drop of water came through.Miss Pleister and the Austrian orderly
 who helped her to pitch them are triumphant.Do get our spy-incident,
 from the office.We had an awful
 two days, but it is quite a joke to look back on.The unit were most
 thoroughly and Britishly angry.But I very soon saw
 the other side, and managed to get them in hand once more.General
 Kropensky, our chief, was a perfect brick.The armoured car section
 sent a special despatch rider over to Galatz to fetch him, and he came
 off at once.He talks perfect English, and he has since written me a
 charming letter saying our _sang-froid_ and our _savoir-faire_ saved
 the situation.I am afraid there was not much _sang-froid_ among us,
 but some of us managed to keep hold of our common sense.As I told
 the girls, in common fairness they must look at the other side--spy
 fever raging, a foreign hospital right on the front, and a Revolution
 in progress.I told them, even if they did not care about Russia, I
 supposed they cared about the war and England, and I wondered what
 effect it would have on all these Russian soldiers if we went away
 with the thing not cleared up, and still under suspicion.After all,
 the ordinary Russian soldier knows nothing about England, except in
 the very concrete form of _us_.We should have played right into the
 devil’s hands if we had gone away.Of course, they saw it at once,
 and we stuck to our guns for England’s sake.The 6th Army, I think,
 understands that England, as represented by this small unit, is keen
 on the war, and does not spy!We have had a telegram from the General
 in command, apologising, and our patients have been perfectly angelic.And the men from all regiments round come up to the out-patients’
 department, and are most grateful and punctiliously polite.You know the Russian greeting
 on Easter morning, “Christ is risen,” and the answer, “He is risen
 indeed.” We learnt them both, and made our greetings in Russian
 fashion.On Easter Eve we went to the church in the village.The church was crowded with soldiers--very
 few women there.They were most reverent and absorbed outside in the
 courtyards.It was a very curious scene; little groups of people with
 lighted candles waiting to get in.Here, we had a very nice Easter
 service.My “choir” had three lovely Easter hymns, and we even sang
 the Magnificat.One of the armoured car men, on his way from Galatz
 to Belgrade, stayed for the service, and it was nice to have a man’s
 voice in the singing.Except that we are very idle, we are very happy here.Our patients are
 delightful, the hospital in good order.The Steppe is a fascinating
 place to wander over, the little valleys, and the villages hidden
 away in them, and the flowers!We have been riding our transport
 horses--rather rough, but quite nice and gentle.We all ride astride
 of course.‘_On Active Service._

      ‘To Mrs.FLINDERS PETRIE,
      Hon.Sec., Scottish Women’s Hospitals.‘RENI, _May 8, 1917_.PETRIE,--How perfectly splendid about the Egyptologists.Miss Henderson brought me your message, saying how splendidly they are
 subscribing.That is of course all due to you, you wonderful woman.It was such a tantalising thing to hear that you had actually thought
 of coming out as an Administrator, and that you found you could not.I cannot tell you how splendid it would have been if you could have
 come.... I want “a woman of the world”... and I want an adaptable
 person, who will talk to the innumerable officers who swarm about this
 place, and ride with the girls, and manage the officials!‘I do wish you could see our hospital now.Such a nice story:--Matron was in Reni the other day, seeing the
 Commandant of the town about some things for the hospital, and when
 she came out she found a crowd of Russian soldiers standing round her
 house.They asked her if she had got what she wanted, and she said the
 Commandant was going to see about it.Whereupon the men said, “The
 Commandant must be told that the Scottish Hospital (_Schottlandsche
 bolnitza_) is the best hospital on this front, and must have whatever
 it wants.That is the opinion of the Russian Soldier.” Do you
 recognise the echo of the big reverberation that has shaken Russia.We get on awfully well with the Russian soldier.Two of our patients
 were overheard talking the other day, and they said, “The Russian
 Sisters are pretty but not good, and the English Sisters are good
 and not pretty.” The story was brought up to the mess-room by quite
 a nice-looking girl who had overheard it.But we thought we’d let
 the judgment stand and be like Kingsley’s “maid”--though we _don’t_
 undertake to endorse the Russian part of it!‘We have got some of the _personnel_ tents pitched now, and it is
 delightful.It was rather close quarters in the little house.I am
 writing in my tent now, looking out over the Danube.Such a lovely
 place, Reni is--and the Steppe is fascinating with its wide plains and
 little unexpected valleys full of flowers.The other night our camp was the centre of a fight.They are drilling recruits here, and suddenly the other
 night we found ourselves being defended by one party while another
 attacked from the Steppe.The battle raged all night, and the camp was
 finally carried at four o’clock in the morning amid shouts and cheers
 and barking of dogs.It was even too much for me, and I have slept
 through bombardments.‘It has been so nice hearing about you all from Miss Henderson.How
 splendidly the money is coming in.Petrie,
 _do_ make them send the reliefs more quickly.I know all about boats,
 but, as you knew the orderlies had to leave on the 15th of January,
 the reliefs ought to have been off by the 1st.‘I wish you could hear the men singing their evening hymn in hospital.I am so glad we thought of putting up the
 icons for them.‘Good-bye for the present, dear Mrs.My kindest regards to
 Professor Flinders Petrie.--Ever yours affectionately,

      ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

      ‘_May 11, 1917._

 ‘It was delightful seeing Miss Henderson, and getting news of all you
 dear people.But she did arrive
 with all her equipment.The equipment I wired for in October, and
 which was sent out by itself, arrived in Petrograd, got through to
 Jassy, and has there stuck.We have not got a single thing, and the
 Consuls have done their best.French, one of the chaplains in Petrograd, came here.He said
 he would have some services here.We pitched a tent, and we had the
 Communion.I have sent down a notice to the armoured car
 yacht, and I hope some of the men will come up.We and they are the
 only English people here.‘The Serbs have sent me a message saying we may have to rejoin our
 Division soon.I don’t put too much weight on this, because I know
 my dearly beloved Serbs, and their habit of saying the thing they
 think you would like, but still we are preparing.I shall be very
 sorry to leave our dear little hospital here, and the Russians.They
 are a fascinating people, especially the common soldier.I hope that
 as we have done this work for the Russians and therefore have some
 little claim on them, it will help us to get things more easily for
 the Serbs.We have one little laddie in, about ten years old, the
 most amusing brat.He was wounded by an aeroplane bomb in a village
 seven versts out, and was sent into Reni to a hospital.But, when he
 got there he found the hospital was for sick only (a very inferior
 place!He wanders about with a Russian
 soldier’s cap on his head and wrapped round with a blanket, and we
 hear his pretty little voice singing to himself all over the place.‘Nicolai, the man who came in when the hospital was first opened,
 and has been so very ill, is really getting better.He had his
 dressing left for two days for the first time the other day, and his
 excitement and joy were quite pathetic.“_Ochin heroshe doktorutza,
 ochin herosho_” (Very good, dear doctor, very good), he kept saying,
 and then he added, “Now, I know I am not going to die!” Poor boy,
 he has nearly died several times, and would have died if he had not
 had English Sisters to nurse him.He has been awfully naughty--the
 wretch.He bit one of the Sisters one day when she tried to give him
 his medicine.Now, he kisses my hand to make up.The other day I
 ordered massage for his leg, and he made the most awful row, howled
 and whined, and declared it would hurt (really, he has had enough pain
 to destroy anybody’s nerve), and then suddenly pointed to a Sister who
 had come in, and said what she had done for him was the right thing.I asked what she had done for him; “Massaged his leg,” she said.I
 got that promptly translated into Russian, and the whole room roared
 with laughter.Poor Nicolai--after a minute, he joined in.His home
 is in Serbia, “a very nice home with a beautiful garden.” His mother
 is evidently the important person there.His father is a smith, and
 he had meant to be a smith too, but now he has got the St.George’s
 Cross, which carries with it a pension of six roubles a month, and he
 does not think he will do any work at all.He is the eldest of the
 family, twenty-four years old, and has three sisters, and a little
 brother of five.Can’t you imagine how he was spoilt!and how proud
 they are of him now, only twenty-four, and a _sous-officier_, and
 been awarded the St.George’s Cross which is better than the medal;
 and been wounded, four months in hospital, and had three operations!He has been so ill I am afraid the spoiling continued in the Scottish
 Women’s Hospital.Laird says she would not be his future wife for
 anything.‘We admitted such a nice-looking boy to-day, with thick, curly, yellow
 hair, which I had ruthlessly cropped, against his strong opposition.I
 doubt if I should have had the heart, if I had known how ill he was.I found him this evening with
 tears running silently over his cheeks, a Cossack, a great big man.He may have to go on to Odessa, as a severe
 operation and bombs and a nervous breakdown don’t go together.‘We have made friends with lots of the officers; there is one, also
 a Cossack, who spends a great part of his time here.His regiment is
 at the front, and he has been left for some special work, and he seems
 rather lonely.He is a nice boy, and brings nice horses for us to
 ride.We have been having quite a lot of riding, on our own transport
 horses too.It is heavenly riding here across the great plain.We all
 ride astride, and at first we found the Cossacks’ saddles most awfully
 uncomfortable, but now we are quite used to them.Our days fly past
 here, and in a sense are monotonous, but I don’t think we are any of
 us the worse for a little monotony as an interlude!quite fairly
 often there is a party at one of the regiments here!The girls enjoy
 them, and matron and I chaperone them alternately and reluctantly.It
 was quite a rest during Lent when there were no parties.‘The spy incident has quite ended, and we have won.Matron was in Reni
 the other day asking the Commandant about something, and when she came
 out she found a little crowd of Russian soldiers round her house.They
 asked her if she had got what she wanted, and she said the Commandant
 had said he would see about it.They answered, “The Commandant must
 be told that the S.W.H.is the best hospital on this front, and that
 it must have everything it wants.” That is the opinion of the Russian
 soldier!If you were here you would recognise the new tone of the
 Russian soldier in these days,--but I am glad he approves of our
 hospital.’

      ‘ODESSA, _June 24, 1917_.‘I wish you could realise how the little nations, Serbs and Rumanians
 and Poles, count on us.What a comfort it is to them to think we are
 “the most tenacious” nation in Europe.In their eyes it all hangs on
 us.I don’t believe we can disentangle
 it all in our minds just now.The only thing is just to go on doing
 one’s bit.Because, one thing is quite clear, Europe won’t be a
 habitable place if Germany wins--for anybody.‘I think there are going to be a lot of changes here.’

      ‘_July 15, 1917._

 ‘I have had German measles!The Consul asked me what I meant by that
 at my time of life!The majority of people say how unpatriotic and
 Hunnish of you!Well, a few days off did not do me any harm.I had
 a very luxurious time lying in my tent.The last lot of orderlies
 brought it out.’

      ‘ODESSA, _Aug.Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.‘The work at Reni is coming to an end, and we are to go to the front
 with the Serbian Division.I cannot write about it owing to censors
 and people.But I am going to risk this: the Serbs ought to be most
 awfully proud.The Russian General on the front is going to insist on
 having them “to stiffen up his Russian troops.” I think you people at
 home ought to know what magnificent fighting men these Serbs are, and
 so splendidly disciplined, simply worth their weight in gold.There
 are only two divisions of them after all.We have about thirty-five of
 them in hospital just now as sanitaries, and they are such a comfort;
 their quickness and their devotion is wonderful.The hospital was full
 and overflowing when I left--still Russians.Most of the cases were
 slight; a great many left hands, if you know what that _means_.I
 don’t think the British Army does know!‘We had a Red Cross inspecting officer down from Petrograd.He was
 very pleased with everything, and kissed my hand on departing, and
 said we were doing great things for the Alliance.I wanted to say many
 things, but thought I had better leave it alone.‘We are operating at 5 A.M.now, because the afternoons are so hot.The other day we began at 5, and had to go till 4 P.M.‘Matron and I had a delightful ride the other evening.Just as we
 had turned for home, an aeroplane appeared, and the first shot from
 the anti-aircraft guns close beside us was too much for our horses,
 who promptly bolted.However, there was nothing but the clear Steppe
 before us, so we just sat tight and went.After a little they
 recovered themselves, and really behaved very well.’

      ‘_Aug.28._

 ‘You dear, dear people, how sweet of you to send me a telegram for
 my birthday.You don’t know how nice it was to get it and to feel you
 were thinking of me.Miss G. brought it
 me with a very puzzled face, and said, “I cannot quite make out this
 telegram.” It was written in Russian characters.She evidently was not
 used to people doing such mad things as telegraphing the “Many happy
 returns of the day” half across the world.I understood it at once,
 and it nearly made me cry.It was good to get it, though I think the
 Food Controller or somebody ought to come down on you for wasting
 money in the middle of a war.‘I am finishing this letter in Reni.We closed the hospital yesterday,
 and joined our Division somewhere on Friday.The rush that had begun
 before I got to Odessa got much worse.They had an awfully busy time,
 a faint reminiscence of Galatz, though, as they were operating twelve
 hours on end, I don’t know it was so very faint.We had no more left
 hands, but all the bad cases.Everybody worked magnificently, but they
 always do in a push.The time a British unit goes to pieces is when
 there is nothing to do!‘So this bit of work ends, eight months.I am quite sorry to leave it,
 but quite quite glad to get back to our Division.‘Well, Amy dearest, good-bye for the present.Love to all you dear people.’

      ‘S.W.H.,

 in a very few days now.We have had a very pleasant time in this
 place with its Turkish name.We are with the Division, and were given this perfectly beautiful
 camping-ground, with trees, and a <DW72> towards the east.The question
 was whether we were going to Rumania or elsewhere.It is nice being
 back with these nice people.They have been most kind and friendly,
 and we have picnics and rides and _dances_, and dinners, and till this
 turmoil of the move began we had an afternoon reception every day
 under the walnut trees!Now, we are packed up and ready to go, and I
 mean to walk in on you one morning.‘We shall have about two months to refit, but one of those is my due

CHAPTER XI

THE MOORINGS CUT

    ‘Not I, but my Unit.’

    ‘My dear Unit, good-bye.’--Nov.‘Into the wide deep seas which we call God
    You plunged.This is not death,
    You seemed to say, but fuller life.’

The reports of Dr.Inglis as chief medical officer to the London
Committee were as detailed and foreseeing in the very last one that
she wrote as in the first from on board the transport that took her
and her unit out.She writes:--‘In view of the fact that we are in the
middle of big happenings I should like Dr.Laird to bring ½ ton cotton
wool, six bales moss dressings, 100 lb.ether, 20
gallons rectified spirits.I wonder what news of the river boat for
Mesopotamia?’ After they had landed and were at work:--‘I have wired
asking for another hospital for the base.I know you have your hands
full, but I also know that if the people at home realise what their
help would mean out here just now, we would not have to ask twice.And
again:--’Keep the home fires burning and let us feel their warmth.’ She
soon encountered the usual obstacles:--‘I saw that there was no good in
the world talking about regular field hospitals to them until they had
tried our mettle.The ordinary male disbelief in our capacity cannot
be argued away.It can only be worked away.’ So she acted.Russia
created disbelief, but the men at arms of all nations saw and believed.In November she wrote back incredulously:--‘Rumours of falling back.Anxious about the equipment.’ In bombardments, in
retreat, and evacuations the equipment was her one thought.‘Stand by
the equipment’ became a joke in her unit.On one occasion one of the
orderlies had a heavy fall from a lorry on which she was in charge of
the precious stuff.Dusty and shaken, she was gathering herself up,
when the voice of the chief rang out imperatively urgent, ‘Stand by the
equipment.’ On the rail certain trucks, bearing all the equipment, got
on a wrong line, and were carried away:--‘The blue ribbon belongs to
Miss Borrowman and Miss Brown.They saw our wagons disappearing with
a refugee train, whereupon these two ran after it and jumped on, and
finally brought the equipment safely to Galatz.They invented a General
Popovitch who would be very angry if it did not get through.Without
those two girls and their ingenuity, the equipment would not have got
through.’

She details all the difficulties of packing up and evacuating after
the despatch rider came with the order that the hospitals were to
fall back to Galatz.The only method their own, all else chaotic and
helpless, working night and day, the unit accomplished everything.At
the station, packed with a country and army in flight, Dr.Inglis had a
talk with a Rumanian officer.He told her that he had been in Glasgow,
and had there been invited out to dinner, and had seen ‘English
customs.’ ‘It was good to feel those English customs were still going
on quietly, whatever was happening here, breakfast coming regularly and
hot water for baths, and everything as it should be.It was probably
absurd, but it came like a great wave of comfort to feel that England
was there quiet and strong and invincible behind everything and
everybody.’

As we read these natural vivid diary reports, we too can feel it was
good of England that Dr.Inglis was to the last on that front--

    ‘Ambassador from Britain’s Crown,
      And type of all her race.’

Dr.Inglis never lost sight of the Army she went out to serve.She
refused to return unless they were brought away from the Russian front
with her.‘I wonder if a proper account of what happened then went home to
 the English papers?The Serbian Division went into the fight 15,000
 strong.They were in the centre--the Rumanians on their left, and the
 Russians on their right.The Rumanians broke, and they fought for
 twenty-four hours on two fronts.They came out of the fight, having
 lost 11,000 men.It is almost incredible, and that is when we ought to
 have been out, and could have been out if we had not taken so long to
 get under way.’

In the last Report, dated October 29, 1917, she tells her Committee she
has been ‘tied by the leg to bed.’ There are notes on coming events:--

 ‘There really seems a prospect of getting away soon.The Foreign
 Office knows us only too well.Only 6000 of the Division go in this
 lot, the rest (15,000) to follow.’

There is a characteristic last touch.‘I have asked Miss Onslow to get English paper-back novels for the
 unit on their journey.At a certain shop, they can be got for a rouble
 each, and good ones.’

To members of that unit, doctors, sisters, orderlies, we are indebted
for many personal details, and for the story of the voyage west,
when for her the sun was setting.Her work was accomplished when on
the transport with her and her unit were the representatives of that
Serbian Army with whom she served, faithful unto death.Miss Arbuthnot, the granddaughter of Sir William Muir, the friend of
John Inglis, was one of those who helped to nurse Dr.Inglis:--

 ‘I sometimes looked after her when the Sister attending her was
 off duty.Her consideration and kindness were quite extraordinary,
 while her will and courage were quite indomitable.To die as she did
 in harness, having completed her great work in getting the Serbs away
 from Russia, is what she would have chosen.Inglis at Hadji Abdul, a small mud village about ten
 miles from Galatz.She was looking very ill, but was always busy.For
 some time she had been ill with dysentery, but she never even stayed
 in bed for breakfast till it was impossible for her to move from bed.‘During our time at Hadji we had about forty Serbian patients, a few
 wounded, but mostly sick.Inglis did a few minor operations, but
 her last major one was a gastro-enterotomy performed on one of our own
 chauffeurs, a Serb, Joe, by name.The operation took three hours and
 was entirely satisfactory, although Dr.Inglis did not consider him
 strong enough to travel back to England.She was particularly fond of
 this man, and took no end of trouble with him.Even after she became
 so very ill she used constantly to visit him.‘The Serbs entertained us to several picnics, which we duly returned.Inglis was always an excellent hostess, so charming and genial
 to every one, and so eager that both entertainers and entertained
 should equally enjoy themselves.Provided her permission was asked
 first, and duty hours or regular meals not neglected, she was always
 keen every one should enjoy themselves riding, walking, or going for
 picnics.If any one was ill, she never insisted on their getting up
 in spite of everything, as most doctors, and certainly all matrons,
 wish us to do.She was strict during duty hours, and always required
 implicit obedience to her orders--whatever they were.She was always
 so well groomed--never a hair out of place.One felt so proud of her among the dirty and generally
 unsuitably dressed women in other hospitals.She was very independent,
 and would never allow any of us to wait on her.The cooks were not
 allowed to make her any special dishes that the whole unit could not
 share.As long as she could, she messed with the unit, and there was
 no possibility of avoiding her quick eye; anything which was reserved
 for her special comfort was rejected.Once, a portion of chicken was
 kept as a surprise for her.She asked whether there had been enough
 for all, and when the cooks reluctantly confessed there was only the
 one portion she sent it away.‘During one of the evacuations, an order had been given that there
 were only two blankets allowed in each valise.Some one, mindful of
 her weakness, stuffed an extra one into Dr.Inglis’ bag, because in
 her emaciated condition she suffered much from the cold.It stirred
 her to impetuous anger, and with something of the spirit of David, as
 he poured out the water brought him at the peril of the lives of his
 followers, she flung the blanket out of the railway carriage, as a
 lesson to those of her unit who had disobeyed an order.Inglis read the Church service with great dignity
 and simplicity.On the weekday evenings, before she became so ill,
 she would join us in a game of bridge, and played nearly every night.During the retreats when nothing more could be done, and she felt
 anxious, she would sit down and play a game of patience.During the
 weeks of uncertainty, when the future of the Serbs was doubtful, and
 she was unable to take any active part, she fretted very much.‘After endless conflicting rumours and days of waiting, the
 news arrived that they were to go to England.Her delight was
 extraordinary, for she had lain in her bed day after day planning how
 she could help them, and sending endless wires to those in authority
 in England, but feeling herself very impotent.Once the good news
 arrived, her marvellous courage and tenacity helped her to recover
 sufficiently, and prepare all the details for the journey with the
 Serbs.We left on the 29th October, with the H.G.Staff and two
 thousand Serbian soldiers, in a special train going to Archangel.Inglis spent fifteen days on the train, in a second-class
 compartment, with no proper bed.Her strength varied, but she was
 compelled to lie down a great deal, although she insisted on dressing
 every morning.On two occasions she walked for five minutes on the
 station platform; each time it absolutely exhausted her.Though she
 suffered much pain and discomfort, she never complained.She could
 only have benger, chicken broth and condensed milk, and she often
 found it impossible to take even these.If one happened to bring her
 tea, or her food, she thanked one so charmingly.‘At Archangel there was no means of carrying her on to the boat, so
 with help (one orderly in front, and one lifting her behind), she
 climbed a ladder twenty feet high, from the platform to the deck of
 the transport.She was a good sailor, and had a comfortable cabin on
 the ship.She improved on board slightly, and used to sit in the small
 cabin allotted to us on the upper deck.She played patience, and was
 interested in our sea-sick symptoms.There was a young naval officer
 very seriously ill on the boat.Our people were nursing him, and she
 constantly went to prescribe; she feared he would not live, and he
 died before we reached our port.Inglis had a relapse; violent pain set
 in, and she had to return to bed.Even then, a few days before we
 reached England, she insisted on going through all the accounts,
 and prepared fresh plans to take the unit on to join the Serbs at
 Salonika.In six weeks she expected to be ready to start.She sent for
 each of us in turn, and asked if we would go with her.Needless to
 say, only those who could not again leave home, refused, and then with
 the deepest regret.Inglis
 had a violent attack of pain, and had no sleep all night.Next morning
 she insisted on getting up to say good-bye to the Serbian staff.‘It was a wonderful example of her courage and fortitude, to see her
 standing unsupported--a splendid figure of quiet dignity.Her face
 ashen and drawn like a mask, dressed in her worn uniform coat, with
 the faded ribbons that had seen such good service.As the officers
 kissed her hand, and thanked her for all she had done for them, she
 said to each of them a few words accompanied with her wonderful smile.’

As they looked on her, they also must have understood, ‘sorrowing most
of all, that they should see her face no more.’

 ‘After that parting was over, Dr.She left the boat Sunday afternoon, 25th November, and
 arrived quite exhausted at the hotel.I was allowed to see her for
 a minute before the unit left for London that night.She could only
 whisper, but was as sweet and patient as she ever was.She said we
 should meet soon in London.’

After her death, many who had watched her through these strenuous
years, regretted that she did not take more care of herself.Symptoms
of the disease appeared so soon, she must have known what overwork and
war rations meant in her state.This may be said of every follower of
the One who saved others, but could not save Himself.The life story
of Saint and Pioneer is always the same.To continue to ill-treat
‘brother body’ meant death to St.Francis; to remain in the fever
swamps of Africa meant death to Livingstone.The poor, and the freedom
of the slave, were the common cause for which both these laid down
their lives.Of the same spirit was this daughter of our race.Had she
remained at home on her return from Serbia she might have been with us
to-day, but we should not have the woman we now know, and for whom we
give thanks on every remembrance of her.Miss Arbuthnot makes no allusion to
its dangers.Everything written by the ‘unit’ is instinct with the
high courage of their leader.We know now how great were the perils
surrounding the transports on the North seas.Old, and unseaworthy, the
menace below, the storm above, through the night of the Arctic Circle,
she was safely brought to the haven where all would be.More than once
death in open boats was a possibility to be faced; there were seven
feet of water in the engine-room, and only the stout hearts of her
captain and crew knew all the dangers of their long watch and ward.As the transport entered the Tyne a blizzard swept over the country.We who waited for news on shore wondered where on the cold grey seas
laboured the ship bringing home ‘Dr.Elsie and her unit.’

In her last hours she told her own people of the closing days on
board:--

 ‘When we left Orkney we had a dreadful passage, and even after we got
 into the river it was very rough.We were moored lower down, and,
 owing to the high wind and storm, a big liner suddenly bore down upon
 us, and came within a foot of cutting us in two, when our moorings
 broke, we swung round, and were saved.I said to the one who told
 me--“Who cut our moorings?” She answered, “No one cut them, they
 broke.”’

There was a pause, and then to her own she broke the knowledge that she
had heard the call and was about to obey the summons.‘The same hand who cut our moorings then is cutting mine now, and I am
 going forth.’

Her niece Evelyn Simson notes how they heard of the arrival:--

 ‘A wire came on Friday from Aunt Elsie, saying they had arrived in
 Newcastle.We tried all Saturday to get news by wire and ’phone,
 but got none.We think now this was because the first news came by
 wireless, and they did not land till Sunday.‘Aunt Elsie answered our prepaid wire, simply saying, “I am in bed, do
 not telephone for a few days.” I was free to start off by the night
 train, and arrived about 2 A.M.were
 at the Station Hotel, and I saw Aunt Elsie’s name in the book.I did
 not like to disturb her at that hour, and went to my room till 7.30.I
 found her alone; the night nurse was next door.She was surprised to
 see me, as she thought it would be noon before any one could arrive.She looked terribly wasted, but she gave me such a strong embrace that
 I never thought the illness was more than what might easily be cured
 on land, with suitable diet.‘I felt her pulse, and she said.“It is not very good, Eve dear, I
 know, for I have a pulse that beats in my head, and I know it has been
 dropping beats all night.” She wanted to know all about every one, and
 we had a long talk before any one came in.Ward had been to her, always, and we arranged that Dr.Aunt Elsie then packed me off to get some breakfast, and
 Dr.Ward told me she was much worse than she had been the night before.‘I telephoned to Edinburgh saying she was “very ill.” When Dr.Williams came, I learnt that there was practically no hope of her
 living.They started injections and oxygen, and Aunt Elsie said, “Now
 don’t think we didn’t think of all these things before, but on board
 ship nothing was possible.”

 ‘It was not till Dr.Williams’ second visit that she asked me if the
 doctor thought “this was the end.” When she saw that it was so, she
 at once said, without pause or hesitation, “Eve, it will be grand
 starting a new job over there,”--then, with a smile, “although there
 are two or three jobs here I would like to have finished.” After this
 her whole mind seemed taken up with the sending of last messages to
 her committees, units, friends, and relations.It simply amazed me how
 she remembered every one down to her grand-nieces and nephews.When I
 knew mother and Aunt Eva were on their way, I told her, and she was
 overjoyed.Early in the morning she told me wonderful things about
 bringing back the Serbs.I found it very hard to follow, as it was an
 unknown story to me.I clearly remember she went one day to the Consul
 in Odessa, and said she must wire certain things.She was told she
 could only wire straight to the War Office--“and so I got into touch
 straight with the War Office.”

 ‘Mrs.M‘Laren at one moment commented--“You have done magnificent
 work.” Back swiftly came her answer, “Not I, but my unit.”

 ‘Mrs.M‘Laren says: ‘Mrs.Simson and I arrived at Newcastle on Monday
 evening.It was a glorious experience to be with her those last two
 hours.She was emaciated almost beyond recognition, but all sense
 of her bodily weakness was lost in the grip one felt of the strong
 alert spirit, which dominated every one in the room.She was clear
 in her mind, and most loving to the end.The words she greeted us
 with were--“So, I am going over to the other side.” When she saw we
 could not believe it, she said, with a smile, “For a long time I
 _meant_ to live, but now I _know_ I am going.” She spoke naturally
 and expectantly of going over.Certainly she met the unknown with a
 cheer!As the minutes passed she seemed to be entering into some great
 experience, for she kept repeating, “This is wonderful--but this is
 wonderful.” Then, she would notice that some one of us was standing,
 and she would order us to sit down--another chair must be brought if
 there were not enough.To the end, she would revert to small details
 for our comfort.As flesh and heart failed, she seemed to be breasting
 some difficulty, and in her own strong way, without distress or fear,
 she asked for help, “You must all of you help me through this.” We
 repeated to her many words of comfort.Again and again she answered
 back, “I know.” One, standing at the foot of the bed, said to her,
 “You will give my love to father”; instantly the humorous smile lit
 her face, and she answered, “Of course I will.”

 ‘At her own request her sister read to her words of the life
 beyond--“Let not your heart be troubled--In my Father’s house are many
 mansions; if it were not so I would have told you,” and, even as they
 watched her, she fell on sleep.‘After she had left us, there remained with those that loved her only
 a great sense of triumph and perfect peace.The room seemed full of a
 glorious presence.One of us said, “This is not death; it makes one
 wish to follow after.”’

As ‘We’ waited those anxious weeks for the news of the arrival of Dr.Inglis and her Army, there were questionings, how we should welcome
and show her all love and service.The news quickly spread she was not
well--might be delayed in reaching London; the manner of greeting her
must be to ensure rest.The storm had spent itself, and the moon was riding high in a cloudless
heaven, when others waiting in Edinburgh on the 26th learnt the news
that she too had passed through the storm and shadows, and had crossed
the bar.That her work here was to end with her life had not entered the minds
of those who watched for her return, overjoyed to think of seeing her
face once more.She had concealed her mortal weakness so completely,
that even to her own the first note of warning had come with the words
that she had landed, but was in bed:--‘then we thought it was time one
of us should go to her.’

Her people brought her back to the city of her fathers, and to the
hearts who had sent her forth, and carried her on the wings of their
strong confidence.There was to be no more going forth of her active
feet in the service of man, and all that was mortal was carried for
the last time into the church she had loved so well.Then we knew and
understood that she had been called where His servants shall serve Him.The Madonna lilies, the lilies of France and of the fields, were placed
around her.Over her hung the torn banners of Scotland’s history.The
Scottish women had wrapped their country’s flag around them in one of
their hard-pressed flights.On her coffin, as she lay looking to the
East in high St.Giles’, were placed the flags of Great Britain and
Serbia.She had worn ‘the faded ribbons’ of the orders bestowed on her by
France, Russia, and Serbia.It has often been asked at home and abroad
why she had received no decorations at the hands of her Sovereign.It
is not an easy question to answer.Inglis was buried, amid marks of respect
and recognition which make that passing stand alone in the history of
the last rites of any of her fellow-citizens.Great was the company
gathered within the church.The chancel was filled by her family and
relatives--her Suffrage colleagues, representatives from all the
societies, the officials of the hospitals and hostels she had founded
at home, the units whom she had led and by whose aid she had done great
things abroad.Last and first of all true-hearted mourners the people
of Serbia represented by their Minister and members of the Legation.The chief of the Scottish Command was present, and by his orders
military honours were paid to this happy warrior of the Red Cross.The service had for its keynote the Hallelujah Chorus, which was played
as the procession left St.It was a thanksgiving instinct with
triumph and hope.The Resurrection and the Life was in prayer and
praise.The Dean of the Order of the Thistle revealed the thoughts of
many hearts in his farewell words:--

 ‘We are assembled this day with sad but proud and grateful hearts to
 remember before God a very dear and noble lady, our beloved sister,
 Elsie Inglis, who has been called to her rest.We mourn only for
 ourselves, not for her.She has died as she lived, in the clear light
 of faith and self-forgetfulness, and now her name is linked for ever
 with the great souls who have led the van of womanly service for God
 and man.A wondrous union of strength and tenderness, of courage
 and sweetness, she remains for us a bright and noble memory of high
 devotion and stainless honour.Especially to-day, in the presence of
 representatives of the land for which she died, we think of her as an
 immortal link between Serbia and Scotland, and as a symbol of that
 high courage which will sustain us, please God, till that stricken
 land is once again restored, and till the tragedy of war is eradicated
 and crowned with God’s great gifts of peace and of righteousness.’

The buglers of the Royal Scots sounded ‘the Reveille to the waking
morn,’ and the coffin with the Allied flags was placed on the gun
carriage.Women were in the majority of the massed crowd that awaited
the last passing.‘Why did they no gie her the V.C.?’ asked the
shawl-draped women holding the bairns of her care: these and many
another of her fellow-citizens lined the route and followed on foot
the long road across the city.As the procession was being formed,
Dr.Inglis’ last message was put into the hands of the members of the
London Committee for S.W.H.It ran:--

      ‘_November 26, 1917._

 ‘So sorry I cannot come to London.Will send Gwynn in a day or two with
 explanations and suggestions.Colonel Miliantinovitch and Colonel
 Tcholah Antitch were to make appointment this week or next from
 Winchester; do see them, and also as many of the committee as possible
 and show them every hospitality.They have been very kind to us, and
 whatever happens, dear Miss Palliser, do beg the Committee to make
 sure that they (the Serbs) have their hospitals and transport, for
 they do need them.‘Many thanks to the Committee for their kindness to me and their
 support of me.‘Dictated to Miss Evelyn Simson.’

How the people loved her!was the thought, as she passed through the
grief-stricken crowds.These, who knew her best, smiled as they said
one to another, ‘How all this would surprise her!’

Edinburgh is a city of spires and of God’s acres, the graves cut in
the living rock, within gardens and beside running waters.Across the
Water of Leith the long procession wound its way.Within sight of the
grave, it was granted to her grateful brethren, the representatives
of the Serbian nation, to carry her coffin, and lower it to the place
where the mortal in her was to lie in its last rest.Her life’s story
was grouped around her--the Serbian officers, the military of her own
nation at war, the women comrades of the common cause, the poor and
suffering--to one and all she had been the inspiring succourer.November mists had drifted all day across the city, veiling the
fortress strength of Scotland, and the wild wastes of seas over which
she had returned home to our island strength.Even as we turned and
left her, the grey clouds at eventide were transfused and glorified by
the crimson glow of the sunset on the hills of Time.Printed in Great Britain by T. and A. CONSTABLE, Printers to His

Transcriber’s note:

Illustrations have been moved to be near the text they illustrate.A very few changes have been made to punctuation for consistency.On page 210 “C’état” has been changed to “C’était” in “C’était
magnifique, magnifique!Ils sont les héros”.Then I returned
to the inn, and looked through the window.In the settlement of my
proceedings I had remembered there was a red blind over the window
which did not entirely cover it, and through the uncovered space I now
saw the strangers sitting at the table as I had left them.Taking care to make no noise I stepped away from the window, and took
up a position from which I could see the door of the inn, which was
closed.I myself was in complete darkness, and there was no moon to
betray me; all that was needed from me was caution.I watched fully half an hour before the door of the inn was opened.No
person had entered during my watch, the inhabitants of Nerac being
early folk for rest and work.The two strangers lingered for a moment
upon the threshold, peering out into the night; behind them was the
landlord, with a candle in his hand.I did not observe that any words
passed between them and the landlord; they stepped into the road, and
the door was closed upon them.Then came the sounds of locking and
bolting doors and windows.I saw the faces of the men as they stood upon the threshold; they were
evil-looking fellows enough, and their clothes were of the commonest.For two or three minutes they did not stir; there had been nothing in
their manner to arouse suspicion, and the fact of their lingering on
the roadway seemed to denote that they were uncertain of the route
they should take.That they raised their faces to the sky was not
against them; it was a natural seeking for light to guide them.To the left lay the little nest of buildings amongst which were Father
Daniel's chapel and modest house, and the more pretentious dwelling of
Doctor Louis; to the right were the woods, at the entrance of which my
own house was situated.The left,
and it was part evidence of a guilty design.The right, and it would
be part proof that the landlord's suspicions were baseless.They exchanged a few words which did not reach my ears.Then they
moved onwards to the left.I grasped my weapon, and crept after them.But they walked only a dozen steps, and paused.In my mind
was the thought, "Continue the route you have commenced, and you are
dead men.The direction of the village was the more tempting to men who
had no roof to shelter them, for the reason that in Father Daniel's
chapel--which, built on an eminence, overlooked the village--lights
were visible from the spot upon which I and they were standing.There
was the chance of a straw bed and charity's helping hand, never
withheld by the good priest from the poor and wretched.On their right
was dense darkness; not a glimmer of light.Nevertheless, after the exchange of a few more words which, like the
others, were unheard by me, they seemed to resolve to seek the
gloomier way.They turned from the village, and facing me, walked past
me in the direction of the woods.I breathed more freely, and fell into a curious mental consideration
of the relief I experienced.Was it because, walking as they were from
the village in which Lauretta was sleeping, I was spared the taking of
these men's lives?It was because of the indication they afforded
me that Lauretta was not in peril.In her defence I could have
justified the taking of a hundred lives.No feeling of guilt would
have haunted me; there would have been not only no remorse but no pity
in my soul.The violation of the most sacred of human laws would be
justified where Lauretta was concerned.She was mine, to cherish, to
protect, to love--mine, inalienably.She belonged to no other man, and
none should step between her and me--neither he whose ruffianly design
threatened her with possible harm, nor he, in a higher and more
polished grade, who strove to win her affections and wrest them from
me.In an equal way both were equally my enemies, and I should be
justified in acting by them as Kristel had acted to Silvain.Ah, but he had left it too late.Not so would I. Let but the faintest
breath of certainty wait upon suspicion, and I would scotch it
effectually for once and all.Had Kristel possessed the strange power
in his hours of dreaming which Silvain possessed, he would not have
been robbed of the happiness which was his by right.He would have
been forewarned, and Avicia would have been his wife.In every step in
life he took there would have been the fragrance of flowers around
him, and a heavenly light.Did I, then, admit that there was any resemblance in the characters of
Avicia and Lauretta?No; one was a weed, the other a rose.Here low desire and cunning; there
angelic purity and goodness.But immeasurably beneath Lauretta as
Avicia was, Kristel's love for the girl would have made her radiant
and spotless.All this time I was stealthily following the strangers to the woods.The sound arrested them; they clutched each other in
fear.I stood motionless, and they stood without movement for many moments.Then they simultaneously emitted a deep-drawn sigh."It was the wind," said the man who had already spoken.I smiled in contempt; not a breath of wind was stirring; there was not
the flutter of a leaf, not the waving of the lightest branch.They resumed their course, and I crept after them noiselessly.They
entered the wood; the trees grew more thickly clustered."This will do," I heard one say; and upon the words they threw
themselves to the ground, and fell into slumber.I bent over them and was
satisfied.The landlord of the Three Black Crows was mistaken.I moved
softly away, and when I was at a safe distance from them I lit a match
and looked at my watch; it was twenty minutes to eleven, and before
the minute-hand had passed the hour I arrived at my house.The door
was fast, but I saw a light in the lower room of the gardener's
cottage, which I had given to Martin Hartog as a residence for him and
his daughter."Hartog is awake," I thought; "expecting me perhaps."I knocked at the door of the cottage, and received no answer; I
knocked again with the same result.The door had fastenings of lock and latch.I put my hand to the latch,
and finding that the key had not been turned in the lock, opened the
door and entered.The room, however, was not without an occupant.At the table sat a
young girl, the gardener's daughter, asleep.She lay back in her
chair, and the light shone upon her face.I had seen her when she was
awake, and knew that she was beautiful, but as I gazed now upon her
sleeping form I was surprised to discover that she was even fairer
than I had supposed.She had hair of dark brown, which curled most
gracefully about her brow and head; her face, in its repose, was sweet
to look upon; she was not dressed as the daughter of a labouring man,
but with a certain daintiness and taste which deepened my surprise;
there was lace at her sleeves and around her white neck.Had I not
known her station I should have taken her for a lady.She was young,
not more than eighteen or nineteen I judged, and life's springtime lay
sweetly upon her.There was a smile of wistful tenderness on her lips.Her left arm was extended over the table, and her hand rested upon the
portrait of a man, almost concealing the features.Her right hand,
which was on her lap, enfolded a letter, and that and the
portrait--which, without curious prying, I saw was not that of her
father--doubtless were the motive of a pleasant dream.I took in all this in a momentary glance, and quickly left the room,
closing the door behind me.Then I knocked loudly and roughly, and
heard the hurried movements of a sudden awaking.She came to the door
and cried softly, "Is that you, father?She opened the door, and fell back a step in confusion."I should have let your father know," I said, "that I intended to
sleep here to-night--but indeed it was a hasty decision."Oh, no, sir," she said.Father is away on
business; I expected him home earlier, and waiting for him I fell
asleep.The servants are not coming till to-morrow morning."She gave them to me, and asked if she could do anything for me.I
answered no, that there was nothing required.As I wished her
good-night a man's firm steps were heard, and Martin Hartog appeared.He cast swift glances at his daughter and me, and it struck me that
they were not devoid of suspicion.I explained matters, and he
appeared contented with my explanation; then bidding his daughter go
indoors he accompanied me to the house.There was a fire in my bedroom, almost burnt out, and the handiwork of
an affectionate and capable housewife was everywhere apparent.Martin
Hartog showed an inclination then and there to enter into particulars
of the work he had done in the grounds during my absence, but I told
him I was tired, and dismissed him.I listened to his retreating
footsteps, and when I heard the front door closed I blew out the
candle and sat before the dying embers in the grate.Darkness was best
suited to my mood, and I sat and mused upon the events of the last
forty-eight hours.Gradually my thoughts became fixed upon the figures
of the two strangers I had left sleeping in the woods, in connection
with the suspicion of their designs which the landlord had imparted to
me.So concentrated was my attention that I re-enacted all the
incidents of which they were the inspirers--the fashioning of the
branch into a weapon, the watch I had set upon them, their issuing
from the inn, the landlord standing behind with the candle in his
hand, their lingering in the road, the first steps they took towards
the village, their turning back, and my stealthy pursuit after
them--not the smallest detail was omitted.I do not remember
undressing and going to bed.Encompassed by silence and darkness I was
only spiritually awake.I was aroused at about eight o'clock in the morning by the arrival of
the servants of the household whom Lauretta's mother had engaged for
me, They comprised a housekeeper, who was to cook and generally
superintend, and two stout wenches to do the rougher work.In such a
village as Nerac these, in addition to Martin Hartog, constituted an
establishment of importance.They had been so well schooled by Lauretta's mother before commencing
the active duties of their service, that when I rose I found the
breakfast-table spread, and the housekeeper in attendance to receive
my orders.This augured well, and I experienced a feeling of
satisfaction at the prospect of the happy life before me.Lauretta would be not only a sweet and loving
companion, but the same order and regularity would reign in our home
as in the home of her childhood.I blessed the chance, if chance it
was, which had led me to Nerac, and as I paced the room and thought of
Lauretta, I said audibly, "Thank God!"Breakfast over, I strolled into the grounds, and made a careful
inspection of the work which Martin Hartog had performed.The
conspicuous conscientiousness of his labours added to my satisfaction,
and I gave expression to it.He received my approval in manly fashion,
and said he would be glad if I always spoke my mind, "as I always
speak mine," he added.It pleased me that he was not subservient; in
all conditions of life a man owes it to himself to maintain, within
proper bounds, a spirit of independence.While he was pointing out to
me this and that, and urging me to make any suggestions which occurred
to me, his daughter came up to us and said that a man wished to speak
to me.I asked who the man was, and she replied, "The landlord of the
Three Black Crows."Curious as to his purpose in making so early a
call, and settling it with myself that his errand was on business, in
connection, perhaps, with some wine he wished to dispose of, I told
the young woman to send him to me, and presently he appeared.There
was an expression of awkwardness, I thought, in his face as he stood
before me, cap in hand."Well, landlord," I said smiling; "you wish to see me?""Go on," I said, wondering somewhat at his hesitation."Can I speak to you alone, sir?"Hartog, I will see you again presently."Martin Hartog took the hint, and left us together."It's about those two men, sir, you saw in my place last night."I said, pondering, and then a light broke upon me,
and I thought it singular--as indeed it was--that no recollection,
either of the men or the incidents in association with them should
have occurred to me since my awaking."_You_ are quite safe, sir," said the landlord, "I am glad to find.""Quite safe, landlord; but why should you be so specially glad?""That's what brought me round so early this morning, for one thing; I
was afraid something _might_ have happened.""Kindly explain yourself," I said, not at all impatient, but amused
rather."Well, sir, they might have found out, somehow or other, that you were
sleeping in the house alone last night"--and here he broke off and
asked, "You _did_ sleep here alone last night?""Certainly I did, and a capital night's rest I had."As I was saying, if they had found out that
you were sleeping here alone, they might have taken it into their
heads to trouble you.""They might, landlord, but facts are stubborn things."I understand that now, sir, but I had my fears, and that's what
brought me round for one thing.""An expression you have used once before, landlord.I
infer there must be another thing in your mind.""As yet I have heard nothing but a number of very enigmatical
observations from you with respect to those men.Ah, yes, I remember;
you had your doubts of them when I visited you on my road home?""I had sir; I told you I didn't like the looks of them, and that I was
not easy in my mind about my own family, and the bit of money I had in
my place to pay my rent with, and one or two other accounts.""That is so; you are bringing the whole affair back to me.I saw the
men after I left the Three Black Crows.""To tell you would be to interrupt what you have come here to say."Well, sir, this is the way of it.I suspected them from the first,
and you will bear witness of it before the magistrate.They were
strangers in Nerac, but that is no reason why I should have refused to
sell them a bottle of red wine when they asked for it.It's my trade
to supply customers, and the wine was the worst I had, consequently
the cheapest.I had no right to ask their business, and if they chose
to answer me uncivilly, it was their affair.I wouldn't tell everybody
mine on the asking.They paid for the wine, and there was an end of
it.They called for another bottle, and when I brought it I did not
draw the cork till I had the money for it, and as they wouldn't pay
the price--not having it about 'em--the cork wasn't drawn, and the
bottle went back.I had trouble to get rid of them, but they stumbled
out at last, and I saw no more of them.Now, sir, you will remember
that when we were speaking of them Doctor Louis's house was mentioned
as a likely house for rogues to break into and rob.""The villains couldn't hear what we said, no more than we could hear
what they were whispering about.But they had laid their plans, and
tried to hatch them--worse luck for one, if not for both the
scoundrels; but the other will be caught and made to pay for it.What
they did between the time they left the Three Black Crows and the time
they made an attempt to break into Doctor Louis's is at present a
mystery.Don't be alarmed, sir; I see that my news has stirred you,
but they have only done harm to themselves.No one else is a bit the
worse for their roguery.Doctor Louis and his good wife and daughter
slept through the night undisturbed; nothing occurred to rouse or
alarm them.They got up as usual, the doctor being the first--he is
known as an early riser.As it happened, it was fortunate that he was
outside his house before his lady, for although we in Nerac have an
idea that she is as brave as she is good, a woman, after all, is only
a woman, and the sight of blood is what few of them can stand."But that I was assured that
Lauretta was safe and well, I should not have wasted a moment on the
landlord, eager as I was to learn what he had come to tell.My mind,
however, was quite at ease with respect to my dear girl, and the next
few minutes were not so precious that I could not spare them to hear
the landlord's strange story."That," he resumed, "is what the doctor saw when he went to the back
of his house.Blood on the ground--and what is more, what would have
given the ladies a greater shock, there before him was the body of a
man--dead.""That I can't for a certainty say, sir, because I haven't seen him as
yet.I'm telling the story second-hand, as it was told to me a while
ago by one who had come straight from the doctor's house.There was
the blood, and there the man; and from the description I should say it
was one of the men who were drinking in my place last night.It is not
ascertained at what time of the night he and his mate tried to break
into the doctor's house, but the attempt was made.They commenced to bore a hole in one of the shutters
at the back; the hole made, it would have been easy to enlargen it,
and so to draw the fastenings.However, they did not get so far as
that.They could scarcely have been at their scoundrelly work a minute
or two before it came to an end.""How and by whom were they interrupted, landlord?"It is not known, sir, and it's just at this point that the mystery
commences.There they are at their work, and likely to be successful.A dark night, and not a watchman in the village.Never a need for one,
sir.Plenty of time before them, and desperate men they.Only one man
in the house, the good doctor; all the others women, easily dealt
with.Robbery first--if interfered with, murder afterwards.They
wouldn't have stuck at it, not they!But there it was, sir, as God
willed.Not a minute at work, and something occurs.The man lies dead on the ground, with a gimlet in his hand, and
Doctor Louis, in full sunlight, stands looking down on the strange
sight.""The man lies dead on the ground," I said, repeating the landlord's
words; "but there were two.""No sign of the other, sir; he's a vanished body."He will be found," I said----

"It's to be hoped," interrupted the landlord."And then what you call a mystery will be solved.""It's beyond me, sir," said the landlord, with a puzzled air.These two scoundrels, would-be murderers, plan a
robbery, and proceed to execute it.They are ill-conditioned
creatures, no better than savages, swayed by their passions, in which
there is no show of reason.They quarrel, perhaps, about the share of
the spoil which each shall take, and are not wise enough to put aside
their quarrel till they are in possession of the booty.They continue
their dispute, and in such savages their brutal passions once roused,
swell and grow to a fitting climax of violence.Probably the disagreement commenced on their way to the house, and had
reached an angry point when one began to bore a hole in the shutter.The proof was in his hand--the
gimlet with which he was working.""Well conceived, sir," said the landlord, following with approval my
speculative explanation."This man's face," I continued, "would be turned toward the shutter,
his back to his comrade.Into this comrade's mind darts, like a
lightning flash, the idea of committing the robbery alone, and so
becoming the sole possessor of the treasure.""Good, sir, good," said the landlord, rubbing his hands.Out comes his knife, or perhaps he
has it ready in his hand, opened.""No; such men carry clasp-knives.They are safest, and never attract
notice.""You miss nothing, sir," said the landlord admiringly."What a
magistrate you would have made!""He plunges it into his fellow-scoundrel's back, who falls dead, with
the gimlet in his hand.The landlord nodded excitedly, and continued to rub his hands; then
suddenly stood quite still, with an incredulous expression on his
face."But the robbery is not committed," he exclaimed; "the house is not
broken into, and the scoundrel gets nothing for his pains."With superior wisdom I laid a patronising hand upon his shoulder."The deed done," I said, "the murderer, gazing upon his dead comrade,
is overcome with fear.He has been rash--he may be caught red-handed;
the execution of the robbery will take time.He is not familiar with
the habits of the village, and does not know it has no guardians of
the night.He has not only committed murder, he has robbed himself.Better
to have waited till they had possession of the treasure; but this kind
of logic always comes afterwards to ill-regulated minds.Under the
influence of his newly-born fears he recognises that every moment is
precious; he dare not linger; he dare not carry out the scheme.Shuddering, he flies from the spot, with rage and despair in his
heart.The landlord, who was profuse in the expressions of his admiration at
the light I had thrown upon the case, so far as it was known to us,
accompanied me to the house of Doctor Louis.It was natural that I
should find Lauretta and her mother in a state of agitation, and it
was sweet to me to learn that it was partly caused by their anxieties
for my safety.Doctor Louis was not at home, but had sent a messenger
to my house to inquire after me, and to give me some brief account of
the occurrences of the night.We did not meet this messenger on our
way to the doctor's; he must have taken a different route from ours."You did wrong to leave us last night," said Lauretta's mother
chidingly.I shook my head, and answered that it was but anticipating the date of
my removal by a few days, and that my presence in her house would not
have altered matters."Everything was right at home," I said.What inexpressible
sweetness there was in the word!"Martin Hartog showed me to my room,
and the servants you engaged came early this morning, and attended to
me as though they had known my ways and tastes for years.""A dreamless night," I replied; "but had I suspected what was going on
here, I should not have been able to rest.""I am glad you had no suspicion, Gabriel; you would have been in
danger.Dreadful as it all is, it is a comfort to know that the
misguided men do not belong to our village."Her merciful heart could find no harsher term than this to apply to
the monsters, and it pained her to hear me say, "One has met his
deserved fate; it is a pity the other has escaped."But I could not
keep back the words.Doctor Louis had left a message for me to follow him to the office of
the village magistrate, where the affair was being investigated, but
previous to going thither, I went to the back of the premises to make
an inspection.The village boasted of one constable, and he was now on
duty, in a state of stupefaction.His orders were to allow nothing to
be disturbed, but his bewilderment was such that it would have been
easy for an interested person to do as he pleased in the way of
alteration.A stupid lout, with as much intelligence as a vegetable.However, I saw at once that nothing had been disturbed.The shutter in
which a hole had been bored was closed; there were blood stains on the
stones, and I was surprised that they were so few; the gate by which
the villains had effected an entrance into the garden was open; I
observed some particles of sawdust on the window-ledge just below
where the hole had been bored.All that had been removed was the body
of the man who had been murdered by his comrade.I put two or three questions to the constable, and he managed to
answer in monosyllables, yes and no, at random."A valuable
assistant," I thought, "in unravelling a mysterious case!"And then I
reproached myself for the sneer.Happy was a village like Nerac in
which crime was so rare, and in which an official so stupid was
sufficient for the execution of the law.The first few stains of blood I noticed were close to the window, and
the stones thereabout had been disturbed, as though by the falling of
a heavy body."Was the man's body," I inquired of the constable, "lifted from this
spot?"He looked down vacantly and said, "Yes.""Sure," he said after a pause, but whether the word was spoken in
reply to my question, or as a question he put to himself, I could not
determine.From the open gate to the
window was a distance of forty-eight yards; I stepped exactly a yard,
and I counted my steps.The path from gate to window was shaped like
the letter S, and was for the most part defined by tall shrubs on
either side, of a height varying from six to nine feet.Through this
path the villains had made their way to the window; through this path
the murderer, leaving his comrade dead, had made his escape.Their
operations, for their own safety's sake, must undoubtedly have been
conducted while the night was still dark.Reasonable also to conclude
that, being strangers in the village (although by some means they must
have known beforehand that Doctor Louis's house was worth the
plundering), they could not have been acquainted with the devious
turns in the path from the gate to the window.Therefore they must
have felt their way through, touching the shrubs with their hands,
most likely breaking some of the slender stalks, until they arrived at
the open space at the back of the building.These reflections impelled me to make a careful inspection of the
shrubs, and I was very soon startled by a discovery.Here and there
some stalks were broken and torn away, and here and there were
indisputable evidences that the shrubs had been grasped by human
hands.It was not this that startled me, for it was in accordance with
my own train of reasoning, but it was that there were stains of blood
on the broken stalks, especially upon those which had been roughly
torn from the parent tree.I seemed to see a man, with blood about
him, staggering blindly through the path, snatching at the shrubs both
for support and guidance, and the loose stalks falling from his hands
as he went.Two men entered the grounds, only one left--that one, the
murderer.Between
the victim and the perpetrator of the deed?In that case, what became
of the theory of action I had so elaborately described to the landlord
of the Three Black Crows?I had imagined an instantaneous impulse of
crime and its instantaneous execution.I had imagined a death as
sudden as it was violent, a deed from which the murderer had escaped
without the least injury to himself; and here, on both sides of me,
were the clearest proofs that the man who had fled must have been
grievously wounded.My ingenuity was at fault in the endeavour to
bring these signs into harmony with the course of events I had
invented in my interview with the landlord.I went straight to the office of the magistrate, a small building of
four rooms on the ground floor, the two in front being used as the
magistrate's private room and court, the two in the rear as cells, not
at all uncomfortable, for aggressors of the law.It was but rarely
that they were occupied.At the door of the court I encountered Father
Daniel.During his lifetime no such
crime had been perpetrated in the village, and his only comfort was
that the actors in it were strangers.But that did not lessen his
horror of the deed, and his large heart overflowed with pity both for
the guilty man and the victim.he said, in a voice broken by tears.Thrust before the Eternal Presence weighed down by sin!I
have been praying by his side for mercy, and for mercy upon his
murderer.I could not sympathise with his sentiments, and I told him so sternly.He made no attempt to convert me to his views, but simply said, "All
men should pray that they may never be tempted."And so he left me, and turned in the direction of his little chapel to
offer up prayers for the dead and the living sinners.Doctor Louis was with the magistrate; they had been discussing
theories, and had heard from the landlord of the Three Black Crows my
own ideas of the movements of the strangers on the previous night."In certain respects you may be right in your speculations," the
magistrate said; "but on one important point you are in error.""I have already discovered," I said, "that my theory is wrong, and not
in accordance with fact; but we will speak of that presently."As to the weapon with which the murder was done," replied the
magistrate, a shrewd man, whose judicial perceptions fitted him for a
larger sphere of duties than he was called upon to perform in Nerac."A club of some sort," said the magistrate, "with which the dead man
was suddenly attacked from behind.""No, but a search is being made for it and also for the murderer."There is no shadow of doubt that the
missing man is guilty.""There can be none," said the magistrate."And yet," urged Doctor Louis, in a gentle tone, "to condemn a man
unheard is repugnant to justice.""There are circumstances," said the magistrate, "which point so surely
to guilt that it would be inimical to justice to dispute them.By the
way," he continued, addressing me, "did not the landlord of the Three
Black Crows mention something to the effect that you were at his inn
last night after you left Dr.Louis's house, and that you and he had a
conversation respecting the strangers, who were at that time in the
same room as yourselves?""If he did," I said, "he stated what is correct.I was there, and saw
the strangers, of whom the landlord entertained suspicions which have
been proved to be well founded.""Then you will be able to identify the body, already," added the
magistrate, "identified by the landlord.Confirmatory evidence
strengthens a case.""I shall be able to identify it," I said.We went to the inner room, and I saw at a glance that it was one of
the strangers who had spent the evening at the Three Black Crows, and
whom I had afterwards watched and followed."The man who has escaped," I observed, "was hump backed.""That tallies with the landlord's statement," said the magistrate."I have something to relate," I said, upon our return to the court,
"of my own movements last night after I quitted the inn."I then gave the magistrate and Doctor Louis a circumstantial account
of my movements, without, however, entering into a description of my
thoughts, only in so far as they affected my determination to protect
the doctor and his family from evil designs.They listened with great interest, and Doctor Louis pressed my hand.He understood and approved of the solicitude I had experienced for the
safety of his household; it was a guarantee that I would watch over
his daughter with love and firmness and protect her from harm."But you ran a great risk, Gabriel," he said affectionately."I did not consider that," I said.The magistrate looked on and smiled; a father himself, he divined the
undivulged ties by which I and Doctor Louis were bound."At what time," he asked, "do you say you left the rogues asleep in
the woods?""It was twenty minutes to eleven," I replied, "and at eleven o'clock I
reached my house, and was received by Martin Hartog's daughter.Hartog
was absent, on business his daughter said, and while we were talking,
and I was taking the keys from her hands, Hartog came home, and
accompanied me to my bedroom.""Were you at all disturbed in your mind for the safety of your friends
in consequence of what had passed?"The men I left slumbering in the woods appeared to
me to be but ordinary tramps, without any special evil intent, and I
was satisfied and relieved.I could not have slept else; it is seldom
that I have enjoyed a better night."May not their slumbers have been feigned?"They were in a profound sleep; I made sure of that.No,
I could not have been mistaken.""It is strange," mused Doctor Louis, "how guilt can sleep, and can
forget the present and the future!"I then entered into an account of the inspection I had made of the
path from the gate to the window; it was the magistrate's opinion,
from the position in which the body was found, that there had been no
struggle between the two men, and here he and I were in agreement.What I now narrated materially weakened his opinion, as it had
materially weakened mine, and he was greatly perplexed.He was annoyed
also that the signs I had discovered, which confirmed the notion that
a struggle must have taken place, had escaped the attention of his
assistants.He himself had made but a cursory examination of the
grounds, his presence being necessary in the court to take the
evidence of witnesses, to receive reports, and to issue instructions."There are so many things to be considered," said Doctor Louis, "in a
case like this, resting as it does at present entirely upon
circumstantial evidence, that it is scarcely possible some should not
be lost sight of.Often those that are omitted are of greater weight
than those which are argued out laboriously and with infinite
patience.Justice is blind, but the law must be Argus-eyed.You
believe, Gabriel, that there must have been a struggle in my garden?""Such is now my belief," I replied."Such signs as you have brought before our notice," continued the
doctor, "are to you an indication that the man who escaped must have
met with severe treatment?""Therefore, that the struggle was a violent one?""Such a struggle could not have taken place without considerable
disarrangement about the spot in which it occurred.On an even
pavement you would not look for any displacement of the stones; the
utmost you could hope to discover would be the scratches made by iron
heels.But the path from the gate of my house to the back garden, and
all the walking spaces in the garden itself, are formed of loose
stones and gravel.No such struggle could take place there without
conspicuous displacement of the materials of which the ground is
composed.If it took place amongst the flowers, the beds would bear
evidence."Then did you observe such a disarrangement of the stones and gravel
as I consider would be necessary evidence of the struggle in which you
suppose these men to have been engaged?"I was compelled to admit--but I admitted it grudgingly and
reluctantly--that such a disarrangement had not come within my
observation."That is partially destructive of your theory," pursued the doctor."There is still something further of moment which I consider it my duty
to say.You are a sound sleeper ordinarily, and last night you slept
more soundly than usual.I, unfortunately, am a light sleeper, and it
is really a fact that last night I slept more lightly than usual.I
think, Gabriel, you were to some extent the cause of this.I am
affected by changes in my domestic arrangements; during many pleasant
weeks you have resided in our house, and last night was the first, for
a long time past, that you slept away from us.It had an influence
upon me; then, apart from your absence, I was thinking a great deal of
you."(Here I observed the magistrate smile again, a fatherly
benignant smile.)"As a rule I am awakened by the least noise--the
dripping of water, the fall of an inconsiderable object, the mewing of
a cat, the barking of a dog.Now, last night I was not disturbed,
unusually wakeful as I was.The wonder is that I was not aroused by
the boring of the hole in the shutter; the unfortunate wretch must
have used his gimlet very softly and warily, and under any
circumstances the sound produced by such a tool is of a light nature.But had any desperate struggle taken place in the garden it would have
aroused me to a certainty, and I should have hastened down to
ascertain the cause."Then," said the magistrate, "how do you account for the injuries the
man who escaped must have undoubtedly received?"The words were barely uttered when we all started to our feet.There
was a great scuffling outside, and cries and loud voices.The door was
pushed open and half-a-dozen men rushed into the room, guarding one
whose arms were bound by ropes.He was in a dreadful condition, and so
weak that, without support, he could not have kept his feet.I
recognised him instantly; he was the hump backed man I had seen in the
Three Black Crows.He lifted his eyes and they fell on the magistrate; from him they
wandered to Doctor Louis; from him they wandered to me.I was gazing
steadfastly and sternly upon him, and as his eyes met mine his head
drooped to his breast and hung there, while a strong shuddering ran
through him.The examination of the prisoner by the magistrate lasted but a very
short time, for the reason that no replies of any kind could be
obtained to the questions put to him.He maintained a dogged silence,
and although the magistrate impressed upon him that this silence was
in itself a strong proof of his guilt, and that if he had anything to
say in his defence it would be to his advantage to say it at once, not
a word could be extracted from him, and he was taken to his cell,
instructions being given that he should not be unbound and that a
strict watch should be kept over him.While the unsuccessful
examination was proceeding I observed the man two or three times raise
his eyes furtively to mine, or rather endeavour to raise them, for he
could not, for the hundredth part of a second, meet my stern gaze, and
each time he made the attempt it ended in his drooping his head with a
shudder.On other occasions I observed his eyes wandering round the
room in a wild, disordered way, and these proceedings, which to my
mind were the result of a low, premeditated cunning, led me to the
conclusion that he wished to convey the impression that he was not in
his right senses, and therefore not entirely responsible for his
crime.When the monster was taken away I spoke of this, and the
magistrate fell in with my views, and said that the assumption of
pretended insanity was not an uncommon trick on the part of criminals.I then asked him and Doctor Louis whether they would accompany me in a
search for the weapon with which the dreadful deed was committed (for
none had been found on the prisoner), and in a further examination of
the ground the man had traversed after he had killed his comrade in
guilt.Doctor Louis expressed his willingness, but the magistrate said
he had certain duties to attend to which would occupy him half an hour
or so, and that he would join us later on.So Doctor Louis and I
departed alone to continue the investigation I had already commenced.We began at the window at the back of the doctor's house, and I again
propounded to Doctor Louis my theory of the course of events, to which
he listened attentively, but was no more convinced than he had been
before that a struggle had taken place."But," he said, "whether a struggle for life did or did not take place
there is not the slightest doubt of the man's guilt, I have always
viewed circumstantial evidence with the greatest suspicion, but in
this instance I should have no hesitation, were I the monster's judge,
to mete out to him the punishment for his crime."Shortly afterwards we were joined by the magistrate who had news to
communicate to us."I have had," he said, "another interview with the prisoner, and have
succeeded in unlocking his tongue.I went to his cell, unaccompanied,
and again questioned him.To my surprise he asked me if I was alone.I
moved back a pace or two, having the idea that he had managed to
loosen the ropes by which he was bound, and that he wished to know if
I was alone for the purpose of attacking me.In a moment, however, the
fear was dispelled, for I saw that his arms were tightly and closely
bound to his side, and that it was out of his power to injure me.He
repeated his question, and I answered that I was quite alone, and that
his question was a foolish one, for he had the evidence of his senses
to convince him.He shook his head at this, and said in a strange
voice that the evidence of his senses was sufficient in the case of
men and women, but not in the case of spirits and demons.I smiled
inwardly at this--for it does not do for a magistrate to allow a
prisoner from whom he wishes to extract evidence to detect any signs
of levity in his judge--and I thought of the view you had presented to
me that the man wished to convey an impression that he was a madman,
in order to escape to some extent the consequences of the crime he had
committed.'Put spirits and demons,' I said to him, 'out of the
question.If you have anything to say or confess, speak at once; and
if you wish to convince yourself that there are no witnesses either in
this cell--though that is plainly evident--or outside, here is the
proof.'I threw open the door, and showed him that no one was
listening to our speech.'I cannot put spirits or demons out of the
question,' he said, 'because I am haunted by one, who has brought me
to this.'He looked down at his ropes and imprisoned limbs.'Are you
guilty or not guilty?''I am not guilty,' he replied; 'I did
not kill him.''Yes,' he replied, 'he is
murdered.''If you did not kill him,' I continued, 'who did?''A demon killed him,' he said, 'and would have
killed me, if I had not fled and played him a trick.'I gazed at him
in thought, wondering whether he had the slightest hope that he was
imposing upon me by his lame attempt at being out of his senses.'But,' I
said, and I admit that my tone was somewhat bantering, 'demons are
more powerful than mortals.''That is where it is,' he said; 'that is
why I am here.''You are a clumsy scoundrel,' I said, 'and I will
prove it to you; then you may be induced to speak the truth--in
which,' I added, 'lies your only hope of a mitigation of punishment.Not that I hold out to you any such hope; but if you can establish,
when you are ready to confess, that what you did was done in
self-defence, it will be a point in your favour.''I cannot confess,'
he said, 'to a crime which I did not commit.I am a clumsy scoundrel
perhaps, but not in the way you mean.'You
say,' I began, 'that a demon killed your comrade.''And,' I continued, 'that he would have killed you if
you had not fled from him.''But,' I
said, 'demons are more powerful than men.Of what avail would have
been your flight?Men can only walk or run; demons can fly.The demon
you have invented could have easily overtaken you and finished you as
you say he finished the man you murdered.'He was a little staggered
at this, and I saw him pondering over it.'It isn't for me,' he said
presently, 'to pretend to know why he did not suspect the trick I
played him; he could have killed me if he wanted.'There again,' I said, wondering that
there should be in the world men with such a low order of
intelligence, 'you heard him pursuing you.Demons glide noiselessly
along.It is impossible you could have heard this one.'I have invented none,' he persisted
doggedly, and repeated, 'I have spoken the truth.'As I could get
nothing further out of him than a determined adherence to his
ridiculous defence, I left him.""Do you think," asked Doctor Louis, "that he has any, even the
remotest belief in the story?"I cannot believe it," replied the magistrate, "and yet I confess to
being slightly puzzled.There was an air of sincerity about him which
might be to his advantage had he to deal with judges who were ignorant
of the cunning of criminals.""Which means," said Doctor Louis, "that it is really not impossible
that the man's mind is diseased.""No," said the magistrate, in a positive tone, "I cannot for a moment
admit it.A tale in which a spirit or a demon is the principal actor!At that moment I made a discovery; I drew from the midst of a bush a
stick, one end of which was stained with blood.From its position it
seemed as if it had been thrown hastily away; there had certainly been
no attempt at concealment."Here is the weapon," I cried, "with which the deed was done!"The magistrate took it immediately from my hand, and examined it."Here," I said, pointing downwards, "is the direct line of flight
taken by the prisoner, and he must have flung the stick away in terror
as he ran.""It is an improvised weapon," said the magistrate, "cut but lately
from a tree, and fashioned so as to fit the hand and be used with
effect."I, in my turn, then examined the weapon, and was struck by its
resemblance to the branch I had myself cut the previous night during
the watch I kept upon the ruffians.I spoke of the resemblance, and
said that it looked to me as if it were the self-same stick I had
shaped with my knife."Do you remember," asked the magistrate, "what you did with it after
your suspicions were allayed?""No," I replied, "I have not the slightest remembrance what I did with
it.I could not have carried it home with me, or I should have seen it
this morning before I left my house.I have no doubt that, after my
mind was at ease as to the intentions of the ruffians, I flung it
aside into the woods, having no further use for it.When the men set
out to perpetrate the robbery they must have stumbled upon the branch,
and, appreciating the pains I had bestowed upon it, took it with them.There appears to be no other solution to their possession of it.""It is the only solution," said the magistrate."So that," I said with a sudden thrill of horror, "I am indirectly
responsible for the direction of the tragedy, and should have been
responsible had they used the weapon against those I love!"We have all happily been spared,
Gabriel," he said."It is only the guilty who have suffered."We continued our search for some time, without meeting with any
further evidence, and I spent the evening with Doctor Louis's family,
and was deeply grateful that Providence had frustrated the villainous
schemes of the wretches who had conspired against them.On this
evening Lauretta and I seemed to be drawn closer to each other, and
once, when I held her hand in mine for a moment or two (it was done
unconsciously), and her father's eyes were upon us, I was satisfied
that he did not deem it a breach of the obligation into which we had
entered with respect to my love for his daughter.Indeed it was not
possible that all manifestations of a love so profound and absorbing
as mine should be successfully kept out of sight; it would have been
contrary to nature.I slept that night in Doctor Louis's house, and the next morning
Lauretta and Lauretta's mother said that they had experienced a
feeling of security because of my presence.At noon I was on my way to the magistrate's office.My purpose was to obtain, by the magistrate's permission, an interview
with the prisoner.His account of the man's sincere or pretended
belief in spirits and demons had deeply interested me, and I wished to
have some conversation with him respecting this particular adventure
which had ended in murder.I obtained without difficulty the
permission I sought.I asked if the prisoner had made any further
admissions or confession, and the magistrate answered no, and that the
man persisted in a sullen adherence to the tale he had invented in his
own defence."I saw him this morning," the magistrate said, "and interrogated him
with severity, to no effect.He continues to declare himself to be
innocent, and reiterates his fable of the demon.""Have you asked him," I inquired, "to give you an account of all that
transpired within his knowledge from the moment he entered Nerac until
the moment he was arrested?""No," said the magistrate, "it did not occur to me to demand of him so
close a description of his movements; and I doubt whether I should
have been able to drag it from him.The truth he will not tell, and
his invention is not strong enough to go into minute details.He is
conscious of this, conscious that I should trip him up again and again
on minor points which would be fatal to him, and his cunning nature
warns him not to thrust his head into the trap.He belongs to the
lowest order of criminals."My idea was to obtain from the prisoner just such a circumstantial
account of his movements as I thought it likely the magistrate would
have extracted from him; and I felt that I had the power to succeed
where the magistrate had failed.I was taken into the man's cell, and left there without a word.He was
still bound; his brute face was even more brute and haggard than
before, his hair was matted, his eyes had a look in them of mingled
terror and ferocity.He spoke no word, but he raised his head and
lowered it again when the door of the cell was closed behind me.But I had to repeat the question twice
before he answered me."Why did you not reply to me at once?"But to this question, although
I repeated it also twice, he made no response."It is useless," I said sternly, "to attempt evasion with me, or to
think that I will be content with silence.I have come here to obtain
a confession from you--a true confession, Pierre--and I will force it
from you, if you do not give it willingly."I understand you," he said, keeping his face averted from me, "but I
will not speak.""Because you know all; because you are only playing with me; because
you have a design against me."His words astonished me, and made me more determined to carry out my
intention.He had made it clear to me that there was something hidden
in his mind, and I was resolved to get at it."What design can I have against you," I said, "of which you need be
afraid?You are in sufficient peril already, and there is no hope for
you.Soon you
will be as dead as the man you murdered.""I did not murder him," was the strange reply, "and you know it.""You are playing the same trick upon me that you
played upon your judge.It was unsuccessful with him; it will be as
unsuccessful with me.What further danger can threaten you
than the danger, the certain, positive danger, in which you now stand?"My body is, perhaps," he muttered, "but not my soul.""Oh," I said, in a tone of contempt, "you believe in a soul.""Yes," he replied, "do not you?"Not out of my fears, but out
of my hopes.""I have no hopes and no fears," he said."I have done wrong, but not
the wrong with which I am charged."His response to this was to hide his head closer on his breast, to
make an even stronger endeavour to avoid my glance."When I next command you," I said, "you will obey.Believing that you possess one, what worse peril can threaten it than
the pass to which you have brought it by your crime."And still he doggedly repeated, "I have committed no crime.""Because you are here to tempt me, to ensnare me.I strode to his side, and with my strong hand on his shoulder, forced
him to raise his head, forced him to look me straight in the face.His
eyes wavered for a few moments, shifted as though they would escape my
compelling power, and finally became fixed on mine.The will in me was strong, and produced its effects on the
weaker mind.Gradually what brilliancy there was in his eyes became
dimmed, and drew but a reflected, shadowy light from mine.Thus we
remained face to face for four or five minutes, and then I spoke."Relate to me," I said, "all that you know from the time you and the
man who is dead conceived the idea of coming to Nerac up to the
present moment."We were poor, both of us," Pierre commenced, "and had been poor all
our lives.That would not have mattered had we been able to obtain
meat and wine.We were neither of us honest, and had
been in prison more than once for theft.We were never innocent when
we were convicted, although we swore we were.I got tired of it;
starvation is a poor game.I would have been contented with a little,
and so would he, but we could not make sure of that little.Nothing
else was left to us but to take what we wanted.The wild beasts do;
why should not we?But we were too well known in our village, some
sixty miles from Nerac, so, talking it over, we said we would come
here and try our luck.We had heard of Doctor Louis, and that he was a
rich man.He can spare what we want, we said; we will go and take.We
had no idea of blood; we only wanted money, to buy meat and wine with.So we started, with nothing in our pockets.On the first day we had a
slice of luck.We met a man and waylaid him, and took from him all the
money he had in his pockets.It was not much, but enough to carry us
to Nerac.We did not hurt the man; a
knock on the head did not take his senses from him, but brought him to
them; so, being convinced, he gave us what he had, and we departed on
our way.We were not fast walkers, and, besides, we did not know the
straightest road to Nerac, so we were four days on the journey.When
we entered the inn of the Three Black Crows we had just enough money
left to pay for a bottle of red wine.We called for it, and sat
drinking.While we were there a spirit entered in the shape of a man.This spirit, whom I did not then know to be a demon, sat talking with
the landlord of the Three Black Crows.He looked towards the place
where we were sitting, and I wondered whether he and the landlord were
talking of us; I could not tell, because what they said did not reach
my ears.He went away, and we went away, too, some time afterwards.We
wanted another bottle of red wine, but the landlord would not give it
to us without our paying for it, and we had no money; our pockets were
bare.Before we entered the Three Black Crows we had found out
Doctor Louis's house, and knew exactly how it was situated; there
would be no difficulty in finding it later on, despite the darkness.We had decided not to make the attempt until at least two hours past
midnight, but, for all that, when we left the inn we walked in the
direction of the doctor's house.I do not know if we should have
continued our way, because, although I saw nothing and heard nothing,
I had a fancy that we were being followed; I couldn't say by what, but
the idea was in my mind.So, talking quietly together, he and I
determined to turn back to some woods on the outskirts of Nerac which
we had passed through before we reached the village, and there to
sleep an hour or two till the time arrived to put our plan into
execution.Back we turned, and as we went there came a sign to me.I
don't know how; it was through the senses, for I don't remember
hearing anything that I could not put down to the wind.My mate heard
it too, and we stopped in fear.We stood quiet a long while, and
heard nothing.Then my mate said, 'It was the wind;' and we went on
till we came to the woods, which we entered.Down upon the ground we
threw ourselves, and in a minute my mate was asleep.Not so I; but I
pretended to be.I did not move;
I even breathed regularly to put it off the scent.Presently it
departed, and I opened my eyes; nothing was near us.Then, being tired
with the long day's walk, and knowing that there was work before us
which would be better done after a little rest, I fell asleep myself.We both slept, I can't say how long, but from the appearance of the
night I judged till about the time we had resolved to do our work.I
woke first, and awoke my mate, and off we set to the doctor's house.We reached it in less than an hour, and nothing disturbed us on the
way.That made me think that I had been deceived, and that my senses
had been playing tricks with me.I told my mate of my fears, and he
laughed at me, and I laughed, too, glad to be relieved.We walked
round the doctor's house, to decide where we should commence.The
front of it faces the road, and we thought that too dangerous, so we
made our way to the back, and, talking in whispers, settled to bore a
hole through the shutters there.We were very quiet; no fear of our
being heard.The hole being bored, it was easy to cut away wood enough
to enable us to open the window and make our way into the house.We
did not intend violence, that is, not more than was necessary for our
safety.We had talked it over, and had decided that no blood was to be
shed.Our plan was to gag and tie
up any one who interfered with us.My mate and I had had no quarrel;
we were faithful partners; and I had no other thought than to remain
true to him as he had no other thought than to remain true to me.Share and share alike--that was what we both intended.So he worked
away at the shutter, while I looked on.A blow came,
from the air it seemed, and down fell my mate, struck dead!He did not
move; he did not speak; he died, unshriven.I looked down, dazed, when
I heard a swishing sound in the air behind me, as though a great club
was making a circle and about to fall upon my head.It was all in a
minute, and I turned and saw the demon.I
slanted my body aside, and the club, instead of falling upon my head,
fell upon my shoulder.I ran for my life, and down came another blow,
on my head this time, but it did not kill me.I raced like a madman,
tearing at the bushes, and the demon after me.I was struck again and
again, but not killed.Wounded and bleeding, I continued my flight,
till flat I fell like a log.Not because all my strength was gone; no,
there was still a little left; but I showed myself more cunning than
the demon, for down I went as if I was dead, and he left me, thinking
me so.Then, when he was gone, I opened my eyes, and managed to drag
myself away to the place where I was found yesterday more dead than
alive.I did not kill my mate; I never raised my hand against him.What I have said is the truth, as I hope for mercy in the next world,
if I don't get it in this!"This was the incredible story related to me by the villain who had
threatened the life of the woman I loved; for he did not deceive me;
murder was in his heart, and his low cunning only served to show him
in a blacker light.I
released him from the spell I had cast upon him, and he stood before
me, shaking and trembling, with a look in his eyes as though he had
just been awakened from sleep."You have confessed all," I said, meeting cunning with cunning.Then I told him that he had made a full confession of his crime, and
in the telling expounded my own theory, as if it had come from his
lips, of the thoughts which led to it, and of its final committal--my
hope being that he would even now admit that he was the murderer."If I have said as much," he said, "it is you who have driven me to
it, and it is you who have come here to set a snare for my
destruction.But it is not possible, because what you have told me is
false from beginning to end."So I left him, amazed at his dogged, determined obstinacy, which I
knew would not avail him.I have been reading over the record I have written of my life, which
has been made with care and a strict adherence to the truth.I am at
the present hour sitting alone in the house I have taken and
furnished, and to which I hope shortly to bring my beloved Lauretta as
my wife.The writing of this record from time to time has grown into a
kind of habit with me, and there are occasions in which I have been
greatly interested in it myself.Never until this night have I read
the record from beginning to end, and I have come to a resolution to
discontinue it.My reason is a sufficient one, and as it concerns no
man else, no man can dispute my right to make it.My resolution is, after to-morrow, to allow my new life, soon to
commence, to flow on uninterruptedly without burdening myself with the
labour of putting into writing the happy experiences awaiting me.I
shall be no longer alone; Lauretta will be by my side; I should
begrudge the hours which deprived me of her society.I must have no secrets from her; and much that here is
recorded should properly be read by no eye than mine.Lauretta's
nature is so gentle, her soul so pure, that it would distress her to
read these pages.I recognise a certain morbid vein
in myself which the continuing of this record might magnify into a
disease.It presents itself to me in the light of guarding myself
against myself, by adopting wise measures to foster cheerfulness.That
my nature is more melancholy than cheerful is doubtless to be ascribed
to the circumstances of my child-life, which was entirely devoid of
light and gaiety.This must not be in the future; I have a battle to
fight, and I shall conquer because Lauretta's happiness is on the
issue.It will, however, be as well to make the record complete in a certain
sense, and I shall therefore take note of certain things which have
occurred since my conversation with Pierre in his cell.That done, I
shall put these papers aside in a secret place, and shall endeavour to
forget them.My first thought was to destroy the record, but I was
influenced in the contrary direction by the fact that my first meeting
with Lauretta and the growth of my love for her are described in it.First impressions jotted down at the time of their occurrence have a
freshness about them which can never be imparted by the aid of memory,
and it may afford me pleasure in the future to live over again,
through these pages, the sweet days of my early intimacy with my
beloved girl.Then there is the strange story of Kristel and Silvain,
which undoubtedly is worth preserving.First, to get rid of the miserable affair of the attempt to rob Doctor
Louis's house.Pierre was tried and convicted, and has paid the
penalty of his crime.His belief in the possession of a soul could
not, after all, have had in it the spirit of sincerity; it must have
been vaunted merely in pursuance of his cunning endeavours to escape
his just punishment; otherwise he would have confessed before he died.Father Daniel, the good priest, did all he could to bring the man to
repentance, but to the last he insisted that he was innocent.It was
strange to me to hear Father Daniel express himself sympathetically
towards the criminal."He laboured, up to the supreme moment," said the good priest, in a
compassionate tone, "under the singular hallucination that he was
going before his Maker guiltless of the shedding of blood.So fervent
and apparently sincere were his protestations that I could not help
being shaken in my belief that he was guilty.""Not in the sense," said Father Daniel, "that the unhappy man would
have had me believe.Reason rejects his story as something altogether
too incredulous; and yet I pity him."I did not prolong the discussion with the good priest; it would have
been useless, and, to Father Daniel, painful.We looked at the matter
from widely different standpoints.Intolerance warps the judgment; no
less does such a life as Father Daniel has lived, for ever seeking to
find excuses for error and crime, for ever seeking to palliate a man's
misdeeds.Sweetness of disposition, carried to extremes, may
degenerate into positive mental feebleness; to my mind this is the
case with Father Daniel.He is not the kind who, in serious matters,
can be depended upon for a just estimate of human affairs.Eric and Emilius, after a longer delay than Doctor Louis anticipated,
have taken up their residence in Nerac.They paid two short visits to
the village, and I was in hopes each time upon their departure that
they had relinquished their intention of living in Nerac.I did not
give expression to my wish, for I knew it was not shared by any member
of Doctor Louis's family.It is useless to disguise that I dislike them, and that there exists
between us a certain antipathy.To be just, this appears to be more on
my side than on theirs, and it is not in my disfavour that the
feelings I entertain are nearer the surface.Doctor Louis and the
ladies entertain a high opinion of them; I do not; and I have already
some reason for looking upon them with a suspicious eye.When we were first introduced it was natural that I should regard them
with interest, an interest which sprang from the story of their
father's fateful life.They bear a wonderful resemblance to each other
they are both fair, with tawny beards, which it appears to me they
take a pride in shaping and trimming alike; their eyes are blue, and
they are of exactly the same height.Undoubtedly handsome men, having
in that respect the advantage of me, who, in point of attractive
looks, cannot compare with them.They seem to be devotedly attached to
each other, but this may or may not be.So were Silvain and Kristel
until a woman stepped between them and changed their love to hate.Before I came into personal relationship with Eric and Emilius I made
up my mind to distrust appearances and to seek for evidence upon which
to form an independent judgment.Some such evidence has already come
to me, and I shall secretly follow it up.They are on terms of the most affectionate intimacy with Doctor Louis
and his family, and both Lauretta and Lauretta's mother take pleasure
in their society; Doctor Louis, also, in a lesser degree.Women are
always more effusive than men.They are not aware of the relations which bind me to the village.That
they may have some suspicion of my feelings for Lauretta is more than
probable, for I have seen them look from her to me and then at each
other, and I have interpreted these looks.It is as if they said, "Why
is this stranger here?I have begged Doctor
Louis to allow me to speak openly to Lauretta, and he has consented to
shorten the period of silence to which I was pledged.I have his
permission to declare my love to his daughter to-morrow.There are no
doubts in my mind that she will accept me; but there _are_ doubts that
if I left it too late there would be danger that her love for me would
be weakened.Yes, although it is torture to me to admit it I cannot
rid myself of this impression.By these brothers, Eric and Emilius, and by means of misrepresentations
to my injury.I have no positive data to go upon, but I am convinced
that they have an aversion towards me, and that they are in their hearts
jealous of me.The doctor is blind to their true character; he believes
them to be generous and noble-minded, men of rectitude and high
principle.I have the evidence of my senses in proof
of it.So much have I been disturbed and unhinged by my feelings towards
these brothers--feelings which I have but imperfectly expressed--that
latterly I have frequently been unable to sleep.Impossible to lie
abed and toss about for hours in an agony of unrest; therefore I chose
the lesser evil, and resumed the nocturnal wanderings which was my
habit in Rosemullion before the death of my parents.These nightly
rambles have been taken in secret, as in the days of my boyhood, and I
mused and spoke aloud as was my custom during that period of my life.But I had new objects to occupy me now--the home in which I hoped to
enjoy a heaven of happiness, with Lauretta its guiding star, and all
the bright anticipations of the future.I strove to confine myself to
these dreams, which filled my soul with joy, but there came to me
always the figures of Eric and Emilius, dark shadows to threaten my
promised happiness.Last week it was, on a night in which I felt that sleep would not be
mine if I sought my couch; therefore, earlier than usual--it was
barely eleven o'clock--I left the house, and went into the woods.Martin Hartog and his fair daughter were in the habit of retiring
early and rising with the sun, and I stole quietly away unobserved.At
twelve o'clock I turned homewards, and when I was about a hundred
yards from my house I was surprised to hear a low murmur of voices
within a short distance of me.Since the night on which I visited the
Three Black Crows and saw the two strangers there who had come to
Nerac with evil intent, I had become very watchful, and now these
voices speaking at such an untimely hour thoroughly aroused me.I
stepped quietly in their direction, so quietly that I knew I could not
be heard, and presently I saw standing at a distance of ten or twelve
yards the figures of a man and a woman.The man was Emilius, the woman
Martin Hartog's daughter.Although I had heard their voices before I reached the spot upon which
I stood when I recognised their forms, I could not even now determine
what they said, they spoke in such low tones.So I stood still and
watched them and kept myself from their sight.I may say honestly that
I should not have been guilty of the meanness had it not been that I
entertain an unconquerable aversion against Eric and Emilius.I was
sorry to see Martin Hartog's daughter holding a secret interview with
a man at midnight, for the girl had inspired me with a respect of
which I now knew she was unworthy; but I cannot aver that I was sorry
to see Emilius in such a position, for it was an index to his
character and a justification of the unfavourable opinion I had formed
of him and Eric.Alike as they were in physical presentment, I had no
doubt that their moral natures bore the same kind of resemblance.Libertines both of them, ready for any low intrigue, and holding in
light regard a woman's good name and fame.Truly the picture before me
showed clearly the stuff of which these brothers are made.If they
hold one woman's good name so lightly, they hold all women so.Fit
associates, indeed, for a family so pure and stainless as Doctor
Louis's!This was no chance meeting--how was that possible at such an hour?Theirs was no new acquaintanceship; it must have
lasted already some time.The very secrecy of the interview was in
itself a condemnation.Should I make Doctor Louis acquainted with the true character of the
brothers who held so high a place in his esteem?This was the question
that occurred to me as I gazed upon Emilius and Martin Hartog's
daughter, and I soon answered it in the negative.Doctor Louis was a
man of settled convictions, hard to convince, hard to turn.His first
impulse, upon which he would act, would be to go straight to Emilius,
and enlighten him upon the discovery I had made.Why, then,
Emilius would invent some tale which it would not be hard to believe,
and make light of a matter I deemed so serious.I should be placed in
the position of an eavesdropper, as a man setting sly watches upon
others to whom, from causeless grounds, I had taken a dislike.Whatever the result one thing was
certain--that I was a person capable not only of unreasonable
antipathies but of small meannesses to which a gentleman would not
descend.The love which Doctor Louis bore to Silvain, and which he had
transferred to Silvain's children, was not to be easily turned; and at
the best I should be introducing doubts into his mind which would
reflect upon myself because of the part of spy I had played.No; I
decided for the present at least, to keep  the knowledge to myself.As to Martin Hartog, though I could not help feeling pity for him, it
was for him, not me, to look after his daughter.From a general point
of view these affairs were common enough.I seemed to see now in a clearer light the kind of man Silvain
was--one who would set himself deliberately to deceive where most he
was trusted.Honour, fair dealing, brotherly love, were as nought in
his eyes where a woman was concerned, and he had transmitted these
qualities to Eric and Emilius.My sympathy for Kristel was deepened by
what I was gazing on; more than ever was I convinced of the justice of
the revenge he took upon the brother who had betrayed him.These were the thoughts which passed through my mind while Emilius and
Martin Hartog's daughter stood conversing.Presently they strolled
towards me, and I shrank back in fear of being discovered.This
involuntary action on my part, being an accentuation of the meanness
of which I was guilty, confirmed me in the resolution at which I had
arrived to say nothing of my discovery to Doctor Louis.They passed me in silence, walking in the direction of my house.I did
not follow them, and did not return home for another hour.How shall I describe the occurrences of this day, the most memorable
and eventful in my life?I am
overwhelmed at the happiness which is within my grasp.As I walked
home from Doctor Louis's house through the darkness a spirit walked by
my side, illumining the gloom and filling my heart with gladness.At one o'clock I presented myself at Doctor Louis's house.He met me
at the door, expecting me, and asked me to come with him to a little
room he uses as a study.His face was
grave, and but for its kindly expression I should have feared it was
his intention to revoke the permission he had given me to speak to his
daughter on this day of the deep, the inextinguishable love I bear for
her.He motioned me to a chair, and I seated myself and waited for him
to speak."This hour," he said, "is to me most solemn.""And to me, sir," I responded."It should be," he said, "to you perhaps, more than to me; but we are
inclined ever to take the selfish view.I have been awake very nearly
the whole of the night, and so has my wife.Our conversation--well,
you can guess the object of it.""Yes, Lauretta, our only child, whom you are about to take from us."I
trembled with joy, his words betokening a certainty that Lauretta
loved me, an assurance I had yet to receive from her own sweet lips."My wife and I," he continued, "have been living over again the life
of our dear one, and the perfect happiness we have drawn from her.I
am not ashamed to say that we have committed some weaknesses during
these last few hours, weaknesses springing from our affection for our
Home Rose.In the future some such experience may be yours, and then
you will know--which now is hidden from you--what parents feel who are
asked to give their one ewe lamb into the care of a stranger.""There is no reason for alarm, Gabriel," he said, "because I
have used a true word.Until a few short months ago you were really a
stranger to us.""That has not been against me, sir," I said, "and is not, I trust.""There is no such thought in my mind, Gabriel.There is nothing
against you except--except," he repeated, with a little pitiful smile,
"that you are about to take from us our most precious possession.Until to-day our dear child was wholly and solely ours; and not only
herself, but her past was ours, her past, which has been to us a
garden of joy.Henceforth her heart will be divided, and you will have
the larger share.That is a great deal to think of, and we have
thought of it, my wife and I, and talked of it nearly all the night.Certain treasures," he said, and again the pitiful smile came on his
lips, "which in the eyes of other men and women are valueless, still
are ours."He opened a drawer, and gazed with loving eyes upon its
contents."Such as a little pair of shoes, a flower or two, a lock of
her bright hair."I asked, profoundly touched by the loving accents
of his voice."Surely," he replied, and he passed over to me a lock of golden hair,
which I pressed to my lips."The little head was once covered with
these golden curls, and to us, her parents, they were as holy as they
would have been on the head of an angel.She was all that to us,
Gabriel.It is within the scope of human love to lift one's thoughts
to heaven and God; it is within its scope to make one truly fit for
the life to come.All things are not of the world worldly; it is a
grievous error to think so, and only sceptics can so believe.In the
kiss of baby lips, in the touch of little hands, in the myriad sweet
ways of childhood, lie the breath of a pure religion which God
receives because of its power to sanctify the lowest as well as the
highest of human lives.It is good to think of that, and to feel that,
in the holiest forms of humanity, the poor stand as high as the rich.""Gabriel, it is an idle phrase
for a father holding the position towards you which I do at the
present moment, to say he has no fears for the happiness of his only
child.""If you have any, sir," I said, "question me, and let me endeavour to
set your mind at ease.In one respect I can do so with solemn
earnestness.If it be my happy lot to win your daughter, her welfare,
her honour, her peace of mind, shall be the care of my life.I love Lauretta with a pure heart;
no other woman has ever possessed my love; to no other woman have I
been drawn; nor is it possible that I could be.She is to me part of
my spiritual life.I am not as other men, in the ordinary acceptation.In my childhood's life there was but little joy, and the common
pleasures of childhood were not mine.From almost my earliest
remembrances there was but little light in my parents' house, and in
looking back upon it I can scarcely call it a home.The fault was not
mine, as you will admit.May I claim some small merit--not of my own
purposed earning, but because it was in me, for which I may have
reason to be grateful--from the fact that the circumstances of my
early life did not corrupt me, did not drive me to a searching for low
pleasures, and did not debase me?It seemed to me, sir, that I was
ever seeking for something in the heights and not in the depths.Books
and study were my comforters, and I derived real pleasures from them.They served to satisfy a want, and, although I contracted a melancholy
mood, I was not unhappy.I know that this mood is in me, but when I
think of Lauretta it is dispelled.I seem to hear the singing of
birds, to see flowers around me, to bathe in sunshine.Perhaps it
springs from the fervour of my love for her; but a kind of belief is
mine that I have been drawn hither to her, that my way of life was
measured to her heart."You have said much," said Doctor Louis, "to comfort and assure me,
and have, without being asked, answered questions which were in my
mind.Do you remember a conversation you had with my wife in the first
days of your convalescence, commenced I think by you in saying that
the happiest dream of your life was drawing to a close?"Even in those early days I felt that I
loved her.""I understand that now," said Doctor Louis."My wife replied that life
must not be dreamt away, that it has duties.""My wife said that one's ease and pleasures are rewards, only
enjoyable when they have been worthily earned; and when you asked,
'Earned in what way?'she answered, 'In accomplishing one's work in
the world.'""Yes, sir, her words come back to me.""There is something more," said Doctor Louis, with sad sweetness,
"which I should not recall did I not hold duty before me as my chief
beacon.Inclination and selfish desire must often be sacrificed for
it.You will understand how sadly significant this is to me when I
recall what followed.Though, to be sure," he added, in a slightly
gayer tone, "we could visit you and our daughter, wherever your abode
happened to be.Continuing your conversation with my wife, you said,
'How to discover what one's work really is, and where it should be
properly performed?'My wife answered, 'In one's native land.'""Those were the words we spoke to one another, sir.""It was my wife who recalled them to me, and I wish you--in the event
of your hopes being realised--to bear them in mind.It would be
painful to me to see you lead an idle life, and it would be injurious
to you.This quiet village opens out no opportunities to you; it is
too narrow, too confined.I have found my place here as an active
worker, but I doubt if you would do so.""There is time to think of it, sir."And now, if you like, we will join my wife and
daughter.""Have you said anything to Lauretta, sir?"I thought it best, and so did her mother, that her heart should
be left to speak for itself."Lauretta's mother received me with tender, wistful solicitude, and I
observed nothing in Lauretta to denote that she had been prepared for
the declaration I had come to make.After lunch I proposed to Lauretta
to go out into the garden, and she turned to her mother and asked if
she would accompany us."No, my child," said the mother, "I have things in the house to attend
to."It was a lovely day, and Lauretta had thrown a light lace scarf over
her head.She was in gay spirits, not boisterous, for she is ever
gentle, and she endeavoured to entertain me with innocent prattle, to
which I found it difficult to respond.In a little while this forced
itself upon her observation, and she asked me if I was not well."I am quite well, Lauretta," I replied."Then something has annoyed you," she said.No, I answered, nothing had annoyed me."But there _is_ something," she said."Yes," I said, "there _is_ something."We were standing by a rosebush, and I plucked one absently, and
absently plucked the leaves.She looked at me in silence for a moment
or two and said, "This is the first time I have ever seen you destroy
a flower.""I was not thinking of it," I said; and was about to throw it away
when an impulse, born purely of love for what was graceful and sweet,
restrained me, and I put it into my pocket.In this the most
impressive epoch in my life no sentiment but that of tenderness could
hold a place in my heart and mind."Lauretta," I said, taking her hand, which she left willingly in mine,
"will you listen to the story of my life?""You have already told me much," she said."You have heard only a part," I said, and I gently urged her to a
seat."I wish you to know all; I wish you to know me as I really am.""I know you as you really are," she said, and then a faint colour came
to her cheeks, and she trembled slightly, seeing a new meaning in my
earnest glances."Yes," she said, and gently withdrew her hand from mine.I told her all, withholding only from her those mysterious promptings
of my lonely hours which I knew would distress her, and to which I was
convinced, with her as my companion through life, there would be for
ever an end.Of even those promptings I gave her some insight, but so
toned down--for her sweet sake, not for mine--as to excite only her
sympathy.Apart from this, I was at sincere pains that she should see
my life as it had really been, a life stripped of the joys of
childhood; a life stripped of the light of home; a life dependent upon
itself for comfort and support.Then, unconsciously, and out of the
suffering of my soul--for as I spoke it seemed to me that a cruel
wrong had been perpetrated upon me in the past--I contrasted the young
life I had been condemned to live with that of a child who was blessed
with parents whose hearts were animated by a love the evidences of
which would endure all through his after life as a sweet and purifying
influence.The tears ran down her cheeks as I dwelt upon this part of
my story.Then I spoke of the happy chance which had conducted me to
her home, and of the happiness I had experienced in my association
with her and hers."Whatever fate may be mine," I said, "I shall never reflect upon these
experiences, I shall never think of your dear parents, without
gratitude and affection.Lauretta, it is with their permission I am
here now by your side.It is with their permission that I am opening
my heart to you.I love you, Lauretta,
and if you will bless me with your love, and place your hand in mine,
all my life shall be devoted to your happiness.You can bring a
blessing into my days; I will strive to bring a blessing into yours."My arm stole round her waist; her head drooped to my shoulder, so that
her face was hidden from my ardent gaze; the hand I clasped was not
withdrawn."Lauretta," I whispered, "say 'I love you, Gabriel.'""I love you, Gabriel," she whispered; and heaven itself opened out to
me.Half an hour later we went in to her mother, and the noble woman held
out her arms to her daughter.As the maiden nestled to her breast, she
said, holding out a hand to me, which I reverently kissed, "God in His
mercy keep guard over you!*   *   *   *   *

These are my last written words in the record I have kept.From this
day I commence a new life.IN WHICH THE SECRET OF THE INHERITANCE TRANSMITTED TO GABRIEL CAREW IS
REVEALED IN A SERIES OF LETTERS FROM ABRAHAM SANDIVAL, ESQ., ENGLAND,
TO HIS FRIEND, MAXIMILIAN GALLENGA, ESQ., CONTRA COSTA CO.,
CALIFORNIA.I.


My Dear Max,--For many months past you have complained that I have
been extremely reticent upon domestic matters, and that I have said
little or nothing concerning my son Reginald, who, since you quitted
the centres of European civilisation to bury yourself in a sparsely
populated Paradise, has grown from childhood to manhood.A ripe
manhood, my dear Max, such as I, his father, approve of, and to the
future development of which, now that a grave and strange crisis in
his life has come to a happy ending, I look forward with loving
interest.It is, I know, your affection for Reginald that causes you
to be anxious for news of him.Well do I remember when you informed me
of your fixed resolution to seek not only new scenes but new modes of
life, how earnestly you strove to prevail upon me to allow him to
accompany you."He is young and plastic," you said, "and I can train him to
happiness.The fewer the wants, the more contented the lot of man."You wished to educate Reginald according to the primitive views to
which you had become so strongly wedded, and you did your best to
convert me to them, saying, I remember, that I should doubtless suffer
in parting with Reginald, but that it was a father's duty to make
sacrifices for his children.My belief was, and
is, that man is born to progress, and that to go back into
primitiveness, to commence again, as it were, the history of the world
and mankind, as though we had been living in error through all the
centuries, is a folly.I did not apply this criticism to you; I
regarded your new departure not as a folly, but as a mistake.I doubt
even now whether it has made you happier than you were, and I fancy
I detect here and there in your letters a touch of sadness and
regret--of which perhaps you are unconscious--that you should have cut
yourself away from the busy life of multitudes of people.However, it
is not my purpose now to enlarge upon this theme.The history I am
about to relate is personal to myself and to Reginald, whose destiny
it has been to come into close contact with a family, the head of
which, Gabriel Carew, affords a psychological study as strange
probably as was ever presented to the judgment of mankind.There are various reasons for my undertaking a task which will occupy
a great deal of time and entail considerable labour.The labour will
be interesting to me, and its products no less interesting to you, who
were always fond of the mystical.I have leisure to apply myself to
it.Reginald is not at present with me; he has left me for a few weeks
upon a mission of sunshine.This will sound enigmatical to you, but
you must content yourself with the gradual and intelligible unfolding
of the wonderful story I am about to narrate.Like a skilful narrator
I shall not weaken the interest by giving information and presenting
pictures to you in the wrong places.The history is one which it is my
opinion should not be lost to the world; its phases are so remarkable
that it will open up a field of inquiry which may not be without
profitable results to those who study psychological mysteries.A few
years hence I should not be able to recall events in their logical
order; I therefore do so while I possess the power and while my memory
is clear with respect to them.You will soon discover that neither I nor Reginald is the principal
character in this drama of life.Gabriel Carew, the owner of an estate in the county of Kent, known as
Rosemullion.My labours will be thrown away unless you are prepared to read what I
shall write with unquestioning faith.I shall set down nothing but the
truth, and you must accept it without a thought of casting doubt upon
it.That you will wonder and be amazed is certain; it would, indeed,
be strange otherwise; for in all your varied experiences (you led a
busy and eventful life before you left us) you met with none so
singular and weird as the events which I am about to bring to your
knowledge.You must accept also--as the best and most suitable form
through which you will be made familiar not only with the personality
of Gabriel Carew, but with the mysterious incidents of his life--the
methods I shall adopt in the unfolding of my narrative.They are such
as are frequently adopted with success by writers of fiction, and as
my material is fact, I am justified in pressing it into my service.I
am aware that objection may be taken to it on the ground that I shall
be presenting you with conversations between persons of which I was
not a witness, but I do not see in what other way I could offer you an
intelligent and intelligible account of the circumstances of the
story.All that I can therefore do is to promise that I will keep a
strict curb upon my imagination and will not allow it to encroach upon
the domains of truth.With this necessary prelude I devote myself to
my task.Before, however, myself commencing the work there is something
essential for you to do.Accompanying my own manuscript is a packet,
carefully sealed and secured, on the outer sheet of which is written,
"Not to be disturbed or opened until instructions to do so are given
by Abraham Sandival to his friend Maximilian Gallenofa."The
precaution is sufficient to whet any man's curiosity, but is not taken
to that end.It is simply in pursuance of the plan I have designed, by
which you will become possessed of all the details and particulars for
the proper understanding of what I shall impart to you.The packet, my
dear Max, is neither more nor less than a life record made by Gabriel
Carew himself up to within a few months of his marriage, which took
place twenty years ago in the village of Nerac.The lady Gabriel Carew
married was the daughter of Doctor Louis, a gentleman of rare
acquirements, and distinguished both for his learning and benevolence.There is no evidence in the record as to whether its recital was
spread over a number of years, or was begun and finished within a few
months; but that matters little.It bears the impress of absolute
truth and candour, and apart from its startling revelations you will
recognise in it a picturesqueness of description hardly to be expected
from one who had not made a study of literature.Its perusal will
perplexedly stir your mind, and in the feelings it will excite towards
Gabriel Carew there will most likely be an element of pity, the reason
for which you will find it difficult to explain."Season your
admiration for a while;" before I am at the end of my task the riddle
will be solved.As I pen these words I can realise your perplexity during your perusal
of the record as to the manner in which my son Reginald came be
associated with so strange a man as the writer.But this is a world of
mystery, and we can never hope to find a key to its spiritual
workings.With respect to this particular mystery nothing shall be
hidden from you.You will learn how I came to be mixed up in it; you
will learn how vitally interwoven it threatened to be in Reginald's
life; you will learn how Gabriel Carew's manuscript fell into my
hands; and the mystery of his life will be revealed to you.Now, my dear Max, you can unfasten the packet, and read the record.I assume that you are now familiar with the story of Gabriel Carew's
life up to the point, or within a few months, of his marriage with
Lauretta, and that you have formed some opinion of the different
persons with whom he came in contact in Nerac.Outside Nerac there was
only one person who can be said to have been interested in his fate;
this was his mother's nurse, Mrs.Fortress, and you must be deeply
impressed by the part she played in the youthful life of Gabriel
Carew.Of her I shall have to speak in due course.I transport you in fancy to Nerac, my dear Max, where I have been not
very long ago, and where I conversed with old people who to this day
remember Gabriel Carew and his sweet wife Lauretta, whom he brought
with him to England some little time after their marriage.It is not
likely that the incidents in connection with Gabriel Carew and his
wife will be forgotten during this generation or the next in that
loveliest of villages.When you laid aside Carew's manuscript he had received the sanction of
Lauretta's mother to his engagement with the sweet maid, and the good
woman had given her children her blessing.Thereafter Gabriel Carew
wrote: "These are my last written words in the record I have kept.He kept his word with respect to
his resolve not to add another word to the record.He sealed it up and
deposited it in his desk; and it is my belief that from that day he
never read a line of its contents.We are, then, my dear Max, in Nerac, you and I in spirit, in the
holiday time of the open courtship of Gabriel Carew and Lauretta.Carew is occupying the house of which it was his intention to make
Lauretta the mistress, and there are residing in it, besides the
ordinary servants, Martin Hartog, the gardener, and his daughter, with
whom, from Carew's record, Emilius was supposed to be carrying on an
intrigue of a secret and discreditable nature.It is evident, from the
manner in which Carew referred to it, that he considered it
dishonourable.There remain to be mentioned, as characters in the drama then being
played, Doctor Louis, Eric, and Father Daniel.The crimes of the two ruffians who had attempted to enter Doctor
Louis's house remained for long fresh in the memories of the
villagers.They were both dead, one murdered, the other executed for a
deed of which only one person in Nerac had an uneasy sense of his
innocence--Father Daniel.The good priest, having received from the
unfortunate man a full account of his life from childhood, journeyed
shortly afterwards to the village in which he had been born and was
best known, for the purpose of making inquiries into its truth.He
found it verified in every particular, and he learnt, moreover, that
although the hunchback had been frequently in trouble, it was rather
from sheer wretchedness and poverty than from any natural brutality of
disposition that he had drifted into crime.It stood to his credit
that Father Daniel could trace to him no acts of cruel violence;
indeed, the priest succeeded in bringing to light two or three
circumstances in the hunchback's career which spoke well for his
humanity, one of them being that he was kind to his bedridden mother.Father Daniel returned to Nerac much shaken by the reflection that in
this man's case justice had been in error.But if this were so, if the
hunchback were innocent, upon whom to fix the guilt?A sadness weighed
upon the good priest's heart as he went about his daily duties, and
gazed upon his flock with an awful suspicion in his mind that there
was a murderer among them, for whose crime an innocent man had been
executed.The gloom of his early life, which threatened
to cast dark shadows over all his days, seemed banished for ever.He
was liked and respected in the village in which he had found his
happiness; his charities caused men and women to hold him in something
like affectionate regard; he was Father Daniel's friend, and no case
of suffering or poverty was mentioned to him which he was not ready to
relieve; in Doctor Louis's home he held an honoured place; and he was
loved by a good and pure woman, who had consented to link her fate
with his.Surely in this prospect there was nothing that could be
productive of aught but good.The sweetness and harmony of the time, however, were soon to be
disturbed.After a few weeks of happiness, Gabriel Carew began to be
troubled.In his heart he had no love for the twin brothers, Eric and
Emilius; he believed them to be light-minded and unscrupulous, nay,
more, he believed them to be treacherous in their dealings with both
men and women.These evil qualities, he had decided with himself, they
had inherited from their father, Silvain, whose conduct towards his
unhappy brother Kristel had excited Gabriel Carew's strong abhorrence.As is shown in the comments he makes in his record, all his sympathy
was with Kristel, and he had contracted a passionate antipathy against
Silvain, whom he believed to be guilty of the blackest treachery in
his dealings with Avicia.This antipathy he now transferred to
Silvain's sons, Eric and Emilius, and they needed to be angels, not
men, to overcome it.Not that they tried to win Carew's good opinion.Although his feelings
for them were not openly expressed, they made themselves felt in the
consciousness of these twin brothers, who instinctively recognised
that Gabriel Carew was their enemy.Therefore they held off from him,
and repaid him quietly in kind.But this was a matter solely and
entirely between themselves and known only to themselves.The three
men knew what deep pain and grief it would cause not only Doctor Louis
and his wife, but the gentle Lauretta, to learn that they were in
enmity with each other, and one and all were animated by the same
desire to keep this antagonism from the knowledge of the family.This
was, indeed, a tacit understanding between them, and it was so
thoroughly carried out that no member of Doctor Louis's family
suspected it; and neither was it suspected in the village.To all
outward appearance Gabriel Carew and Eric and Emilius were friends.It was not the brothers but Carew who, in the first instance, was to
blame.He was the originator and the creator of the trouble, for it is
scarcely to be doubted that had he held out the hand of a frank
friendship to them, they would have accepted it, even though their
acceptance needed some sacrifice on their parts.The reason for this
qualification will be apparent to you later on in the story, and you
will then also understand why I do not reveal certain circumstances
respecting the affection of Eric and Emilius for Martin Hartog's
daughter, Patricia, and for the female members of the family of Doctor
Louis.I am relating the story in the
order in which it progressed, and, so far as my knowledge of it goes,
according to the sequence of time.Certainly the dominant cause of Gabriel Carew's hatred for the
brothers sprang from his jealousy of them with respect to Lauretta.They and she had been friends from childhood, and they were regarded
by Doctor Louis and his wife as members of their family.This in
itself was sufficient to inflame so exacting a lover as Carew.He
interpreted every innocent little familiarity to their disadvantage,
and magnified trifles inordinately.They saw his sufferings and were,
perhaps, somewhat scornful of them.He had already shown them how deep
was his hatred of them, and they not unnaturally resented it.After
all, he was a stranger in Nerac, a come-by-chance visitor, who had
usurped the place which might have been occupied by one of them had
the winds been fair.Instead of being overbearing and arrogant he
should have been gracious and conciliating.It was undoubtedly his
duty to be courteous and mannerly from the first day of their
acquaintance; instead of which he had, before he saw them, contracted
a dislike for them which he had allowed to swell to monstrous and
unjustifiable proportions.Gabriel Carew, however, justified himself to himself, and it may be
at once conceded that he had grounds for his feelings which were to
him--and would likely have been to some other men--sufficient.When a lover's suspicious and jealous nature is aroused it does not
from that moment sleep.There is no rest, no repose for it.If it
require opportunities for confirmation or for the infliction of
self-suffering, it is never difficult to find them.Imagination steps
in and supplies the place of fact.Every hour is a torture; every
innocent look and smile is brooded over in secret.A most prolific,
unreasonable, and cruel breeder of shadows is jealousy, and the evil
of it is that it breeds in secret.Gabriel Carew set himself to watch, and from the keen observance of a
nature so thorough and intense as his nothing could escape.He was an
unseen witness of other interviews between Patricia Hartog and
Emilius; and not only of interviews between her and Emilius but
between her and Eric.The brothers were
playing false to each other, and the girl was playing false with both.This was of little account; he had no more than a passing interest in
Patricia, and although at one time he had some kind of intention of
informing Martin Hartog of these secret interviews, and placing the
father on his guard--for the gardener seemed to be quite unaware that
an intrigue was going on--he relinquished the intention, saying that
it was no affair of his.But it confirmed the impressions he had
formed of the character of Eric and Emilius, and it strengthened him
in his determination to allow no intercourse between them and the
woman he loved.An additional torture was in store for him, and it fell upon him like
a thunderbolt.One day he saw Emilius and Lauretta walking in the
woods, talking earnestly and confidentially together.His blood
boiled; his heart beat so violently that he could scarcely distinguish
surrounding objects.So violent was his agitation that it was many
minutes before he recovered himself, and then Lauretta and Emilius had
passed out of sight.He went home in a wild fury of despair.He had not been near enough to hear one word of the conversation, but
their attitude was to him confirmation of his jealous suspicion that
the young man was endeavouring to supplant him in Lauretta's
affections.In the evening he saw Lauretta in her home, and she
noticed a change in him."No," he replied, "I am quite well.The bitterness in his voice surprised her, and she insisted that he
should seek repose."To get me out of the way," he thought; and then,
gazing into her solicitous and innocent eyes, he mutely reproached
himself for doubting her.No, it was not she who was to blame; she was
still his, she was still true to him; but how easy was it for a friend
so close to her as Emilius to instil into her trustful heart evil
reports against himself!"That is the first step," he thought.These men, these villains, are capable of any
treachery.Honour is a stranger to their scheming natures.To meet them openly, to accuse them openly, may be my ruin.They are too firmly fixed in the affections of Doctor Louis and his
wife--they are too firmly fixed in the affections of even Lauretta
herself--for me to hope to expose them upon evidence so slender.Not
slender to me, but to them.These treacherous brothers are conspiring
secretly against me.I will wait and watch till I have the strongest proof
against them, and then I will expose their true characters to Doctor
Louis and Lauretta."Having thus resolved, he was not the man to swerve from the plan he
laid down.The nightly vigils he had kept in his young life served him
now, and it seemed as if he could do without sleep.The stealthy
meetings between Patricia and the brothers continued, and before long
he saw Eric and Lauretta in the woods together.In his espionage he
was always careful not to approach near enough to bring discovery upon
himself.In an indirect manner, as though it was a matter which he deemed of
slight importance, he questioned Lauretta as to her walks in the woods
with Eric and Emilius."Yes," she said artlessly, "we sometimes meet there.""Not always by accident," replied Lauretta."Remember, Gabriel, Eric
and Emilius are as my brothers, and if they have a secret----" And
then she blushed, grew confused, and paused.These signs were poisoned food indeed to Carew, but he did not betray
himself."It was wrong of me to speak," said Lauretta, "after my promise to say
nothing to a single soul in the village.""And most especially," said Carew, hitting the mark, "to me.""Only," he continued, with slight persistence, "that it must be a
heart secret."She was silent, and he dropped the subject.From the interchange of these few words he extracted the most
exquisite torture.There was, then, between Lauretta and the brothers
a secret of the heart, known only to themselves, to be revealed to
none, and to him, Gabriel Carew, to whom the young girl was affianced,
least of all.It must be well understood, in this explanation of what
was occurring in the lives of these young people at that momentous
period, that Gabriel Carew never once suspected that Lauretta was
false to him.His great fear was that Eric and Emilius were working
warily against him, and were cunningly fabricating some kind of
evidence in his disfavour which would rob him of Lauretta's love.They
were conspiring to this end, to the destruction of his happiness, and
they were waiting for the hour to strike the fatal blow.Well, it was
for him to strike first.His love for Lauretta was so all-absorbing
that all other considerations--however serious the direct or indirect
consequences of them--sank into utter insignificance by the side of
it.He did not allow it to weigh against Lauretta that she appeared to
be in collusion with Eric and Emilius, and to be favouring their
schemes.Her nature was so guileless and unsuspecting that she could
be easily led and deceived by friends in whom she placed a trust.It
was this that strengthened Carew in his resolve not to rudely make the
attempt to open her eyes to the perfidy of Eric and Emilius.She would
have been incredulous, and the arguments he should use against his
enemies might be turned against himself.Therefore he adhered to the
line of action he had marked out.He waited, and watched, and
suffered.Meanwhile, the day appointed for his union with Lauretta was
approaching.Within a fortnight of that day Gabriel Carew's passions were roused to
an almost uncontrollable pitch.It was evening, and he saw Eric and Emilius in the woods.They were
conversing with more than ordinary animation, and appeared to be
discussing some question upon which they did not agree.Carew saw
signs which he could not interpret--appeals, implorings, evidences of
strong feeling on one side and of humbleness on the other, despair
from one, sorrow from the other; and then suddenly a phase which
startled the watcher and filled him with a savage joy.Eric, in a
paroxysm, laid hands furiously upon his brother, and it seemed for a
moment as if a violent struggle were about to take place.It was to the restraint and moderation of Emilius that this
unbrotherly conflict was avoided.He did not meet violence with
violence; after a pause he gently lifted Eric's hands from his
shoulders, and with a sad look turned away, Eric gazing at his
retreating figure in a kind of bewilderment.Presently Emilius was
gone, and only Eric remained.From an opposite direction to that taken by
Emilius the watcher saw approaching the form of the woman he loved,
and to whom he was shortly to be wed.That her coming was not
accidental, but in fulfilment of a promise was clear to Gabriel Carew.Eric expected her, and welcomed her without surprise.Then the two
began to converse.Carew's heart beat tumultuously; he would have given worlds to hear
what was being said, but he was at too great a distance for a word to
reach his ears.For a time Eric was the principal speaker, Lauretta,
for the most part, listening, and uttering now and then merely a word
or two.In her quiet way she appeared to be as deeply agitated as the
young man who was addressing her in an attitude of despairing appeal.Again and again it seemed as if he had finished what he had to say,
and again and again he resumed, without abatement of the excitement
under which he was labouring.At length he ceased, and then Lauretta
became the principal actor in the scene.She spoke long and forcibly,
but always with that gentleness of manner which was one of her
sweetest characteristics.In her turn she seemed to be appealing to
the young man, and to be endeavouring to impress upon him a sad and
bitter truth which he was unwilling, and not in the mood, to
recognise.For a long time she was unsuccessful; the young man walked
impatiently a few steps from her, then returned, contrite and humble,
but still with all the signs of great suffering upon him.At length
her words had upon him the effect she desired; he wavered, he held out
his hands helplessly, and presently covered his face with them and
sank to the ground.Then, after a silence, during which Lauretta gazed
compassionately upon his convulsed form, she stooped and placed her
hand upon his shoulder.He lifted his eyes, from which the tears were
flowing, and raised himself from the earth.He stood before her with
bowed head, and she continued to speak.The pitiful sweetness of her
face almost drove Carew mad; it could not be mistaken that her heart
was beating with sympathy for Eric's sufferings.A few minutes more
passed, and then it seemed as if she had prevailed.Eric accepted the
hand she held out to him, and pressed his lips upon it.Had he at that
moment been within Gabriel Carew's reach, it would have fared ill with
both these men, but Heaven alone knows whether it would have averted
what was to follow before the setting of another sun, to the
consternation and grief of the entire village.After pressing his lips
to Lauretta's hand, the pair separated, each going a different way,
and Gabriel Carew ground his teeth as he observed that there were
tears in Lauretta's eyes as well as in Eric's.A darkness fell upon
him as he walked homewards.V.


The following morning Nerac and the neighbourhood around were agitated
by news of a tragedy more thrilling and terrible than that in which
the hunchback and his companion in crime were concerned.In attendance
upon this tragedy, and preceding its discovery, was a circumstance
stirring enough in its way in the usually quiet life of the simple
villagers, but which, in the light of the mysterious tragedy, would
have paled into insignificance had it not been that it appeared to
have a direct bearing upon it.Martin Hartog's daughter, Patricia, had
fled from her home, and was nowhere to be discovered.This flight was made known to the villagers early in the morning by
the appearance among them of Martin Hartog, demanding in which house
his daughter had taken refuge.The man was distracted; his wild words
and actions excited great alarm, and when he found that he could
obtain no satisfaction from them, and that every man and woman in
Nerac professed ignorance of his daughter's movements, he called down
heaven's vengeance upon the man who had betrayed her, and left them to
search the woods for Patricia.The words he had uttered in his imprecations when he called upon a
higher power for vengeance on a villain opened the villagers' eyes.Who was the monster who had
worked this evil?While they were talking excitedly together they saw Gabriel Carew
hurrying to the house of Father Daniel.He was admitted, and in the
course of a few minutes emerged from it in the company of the good
priest, whose troubled face denoted that he had heard the sad news of
Patricia's flight from her father's home.The villagers held aloof
from Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew, seeing that they were in earnest
converse.Carew was imparting to the priest his suspicions of Eric and
Emilius in connection with this event; he did not mention Lauretta's
name, but related how on several occasions he had been an accidental
witness of meetings between Patricia and one or other of the brothers."It was not for me to place a construction upon these meetings," said
Carew, "nor did it appear to me that I was called upon to mention it
to any one.It would have been natural for me to suppose that Martin
Hartog was fully acquainted with his daughter's movements, and that,
being of an independent nature, he would have resented any
interference from me.He is Patricia's father, and it was believed by
all that he guarded her well.Had he been my equal I might have
incidentally asked whether there was anything serious between his
daughter and these brothers, but I am his master, and therefore was
precluded from inviting a confidence which can only exist between men
occupying the same social condition.There is, besides, another reason
for my silence which, if you care to hear, I will impart to you.""Nothing should be concealed from me," said Father Daniel."Although," said Gabriel Carew, "I have been a resident here now for
some time, I felt, and feel, that a larger knowledge of me is
necessary to give due and just weight to the unfavourable opinion I
have formed of two men with whom you have been acquainted from
childhood, and who hold a place in your heart of which they are
utterly unworthy.Not alone in your heart, but in the hearts of my
dearest friends, Doctor Louis and his family."You refer to Eric and Emilius," said the priest."What you have already said concerning them has deeply pained me.Their meetings with Hartog's daughter were,
I am convinced, innocent.They are incapable of an act of baseness;
they are of noble natures, and it is impossible that they should ever
have harboured a thought of treachery to a young maiden.""I am more than justified," said Gabriel Carew, "by the expression of
your opinion, in the course I took.You would have listened with
impatience to me, and what I should have said would have recoiled on
myself.Yet now I regret that I did not interfere; this calamity might
have been avoided, and a woman's honour saved.Let us seek Martin
Hartog; he may be in possession of information to guide us."From the villagers they learnt that Hartog had gone to the woods, and
they were about to proceed in that direction when another, who had
just arrived, informed them that he had seen Hartog going to Gabriel
Carew's house.Thither they proceeded, and found Hartog in his
cottage.He was on his knees, when they entered, before a box in which
his daughter kept her clothes.This he had forced open, and was
searching.He looked wildly at Father Daniel and Carew, and
immediately resumed his task, throwing the girl's clothes upon the
floor after examining the pockets.In his haste and agitation he did
not observe a portrait which he had cast aside, Carew picked it up and
handed it to Father Daniel."Who is the more
likely to be right in our estimate of these brothers, you or I?"Father Daniel, overwhelmed by the evidence, did not reply.By this
time Martin Hartog had found a letter which he was eagerly perusing."If there is justice in heaven he has
met with his deserts.If he still lives he shall die by my hands!""Vengeance is not yours to deal
out.Pray for comfort--pray for mercy."If the monster be not already smitten, Lord, give him into
my hands!The
cunning villain has not even signed his name!"Father Daniel took the letter from his unresisting hand, and as his
eyes fell upon the writing he started and trembled.It was indeed the writing of Emilius.Martin Hartog had heard Carew's
inquiry and the priest's reply.And without another word he rushed
from the cottage.Carew and the priest hastily followed him, but he
outstripped them, and was soon out of sight."There will be a deed of violence done," said Father Daniel, "if the
men meet.I must go immediately to the house of these unhappy brothers
and warn them."Carew accompanied him, but when they arrived at the house they were
informed that nothing had been seen of Eric and Emilius since the
previous night.Neither of them had been home nor slept in his bed.This seemed to complicate the mystery in Father Daniel's eyes,
although it was no mystery to Carew, who was convinced that where
Patricia was there would Emilius be found.Father Daniel's grief and
horror were clearly depicted.He looked upon the inhabitants of Nerac
as one family, and he regarded the dishonour of Martin Hartog's
daughter as dishonour to all.Carew, being anxious to see Lauretta,
left him to his inquiries.Louis and his family were already
acquainted with the agitating news."Dark clouds hang over this once happy village," said Doctor Louis to
Carew.He was greatly shocked, but he had no hesitation in declaring that,
although circumstances looked black against the twin brothers, his
faith in them was undisturbed.Lauretta shared his belief, and
Lauretta's mother also.Gabriel Carew did not combat with them; he
held quietly to his views, convinced that in a short time they would
think as he did.Lauretta was very pale, and out of consideration for
her Gabriel Carew endeavoured to avoid the all-engrossing subject.Nothing else could be thought or spoken
of.Once Carew remarked
to Lauretta, "You said that Eric and Emilius had a secret, and you
gave me to understand that you were not ignorant of it.Has it any
connection with what has occurred?""I must not answer you, Gabriel," she replied; "when we see Emilius
again all will be explained."Little did she suspect the awful import of those simple words.In
Carew's mind the remembrance of the story of Kristel and Silvain was
very vivid."Were Eric and Emilius true friends?"Lauretta looked at him piteously; her lips quivered."They are
brothers," she said.She gazed at him in tender surprise; for weeks past he had not been so
happy.The trouble by which he had been haunted took flight."And yet," he could not help saying, "you have a secret, and you keep
it from me!"His voice was almost gay; there was no touch of reproach in it."The secret is not mine, Gabriel," she said, and she allowed him to
pass his arm around her; her head sank upon his breast."When you know
all, you will approve," she murmured."As I trust you, so must you
trust me."Their lips met; perfect confidence and faith were established between
them, although on Lauretta's side there had been no shadow on the love
she gave him.It was late in the afternoon when Carew was informed that Father
Daniel wished to speak to him privately.He kissed Lauretta and went
out to the priest, in whose face he saw a new horror."I should be the first to tell them," said Father Daniel in a husky
voice, "but I am not yet strong enough."No," replied the priest, "but Eric is.I would not have him removed
until the magistrate, who is absent and has been sent for, arrives.In a state of wonder Carew accompanied Father Daniel out of Doctor
Louis's house, and the priest led the way to the woods."We have passed the
house in which the brothers live."The sun was setting, and the light was quivering on the tops of the
distant trees.Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew plunged into the woods.There were scouts on the outskirts, to whom the priest said, "Has the
magistrate arrived?""No, father," was the answer, "we expect him every moment."From that moment until they arrived at the spot to which Father Daniel
led him, Carew was silent.What had passed between him and Lauretta
had so filled his soul with happiness that he bestowed but little
thought upon a vulgar intrigue between a peasant girl and men whom he
had long since condemned.They no longer troubled him; they had passed
for ever out of his life, and his heart was at rest.Father Daniel and
he walked some distance into the shadows of the forest and the night.Before him he saw lights in the hands of two villagers who had
evidently been stationed there to keep guard."Yes," he replied, "it is I."He conducted Gabriel Carew to a spot, and pointed downwards with his
finger; and there, prone and still upon the fallen leaves, lay the
body of Eric stone dead, stabbed to the heart!"Martin Hartog," said the priest, "is in custody on suspicion of this
ruthless murder.""What evidence is there to incriminate
him?""When the body was first discovered," said the priest, "your gardener
was standing by its side.Upon being questioned his answer was, 'If
judgment has not fallen upon the monster, it has overtaken his
brother.The brood should be wiped off the face of the earth.'Gabriel Carew was overwhelmed by the horror of this discovery.The
meeting between the brothers, of which he had been a secret witness on
the previous evening, and during which Eric had laid violent hands on
Emilius, recurred to him.He had not spoken of it, nor did he mention
it now.If Martin Hartog confessed his guilt
the matter was settled; if he did not, the criminal must be sought
elsewhere, and it would be his duty to supply evidence which would
tend to fix the crime upon Emilius.He did not believe Martin Hartog
to be guilty; he had already decided within himself that Emilius had
murdered Eric, and that the tragedy of Kristel and Silvain had been
repeated in the lives of Silvain's sons.There was a kind of
retribution in this which struck Gabriel Carew with singular force."Useless," he thought, "to fly from a fate which is preordained.When
he recovered from the horror which had fallen on him upon beholding
the body of Eric, he asked Father Daniel at what hour of the day the
unhappy man had been killed."That," said Father Daniel, "has yet to be determined.No doctor has
seen the body, but the presumption is that when Martin Hartog,
animated by his burning craving for vengeance, of which we were both a
witness, rushed from his cottage, he made his way to the woods, and
that he here unhappily met the brother of the man whom he believed to
be the betrayer of his daughter.The arrival of the magistrate put a stop to the conversation.He
listened to what Father Daniel had to relate, and some portions of the
priest's explanations were corroborated by Gabriel Carew.The
magistrate then gave directions that the body of Eric should be
conveyed to the courthouse; and he and the priest and Carew walked
back to the village together."The village will become notorious," he remarked."Is there an
epidemic of murder amongst us that this one should follow so closely
upon the heels of the other?"Then, after a pause, he asked Father
Daniel whether he believed Martin Hartog to be guilty."I believe no man to be guilty," said the priest, "until he is proved
so incontrovertibly."I bear in remembrance," said the magistrate, "that you would not
subscribe to the general belief in the hunchback's guilt.""Nor do I now," said Father Daniel."And you," said the magistrate, turning to Gabriel Carew, "do you
believe Hartog to be guilty?""This is not the time or place," said Carew, "for me to give
expression to any suspicion I may entertain.The first thing to be
settled is Hartog's complicity in this murder.""Father Daniel believes," continued Carew, "that Eric was murdered
to-day, within the last hour or two."The doctors will decide that," said the magistrate."If the deed was
not, in your opinion, perpetrated within the last few hours, when do
you suppose it was done?""Have you any distinct grounds for the belief?"You have asked me a question which I have answered.There is no
matter of absolute knowledge involved in it; if there were I should be
able to speak more definitely.Until the doctors pronounce there is
nothing more to be said.But I may say this: if Hartog is proved to be
innocent, I may have something to reveal in the interests of justice."The magistrate nodded and said, "By the way, where is Emilius, and
what has he to say about it?""Neither Eric nor Emilius," replied Father Daniel, "slept at home last
night, and since yesterday evening Emilius has not been seen.""Nothing is known of him," said Father Daniel."Inquiries have been
made, but nothing satisfactory has been elicited."The magistrate glanced at Carew, and for a little while was silent.Shortly after they reached the court-house the doctors presented their
report.In their opinion Eric had been dead at least fourteen or
fifteen hours, certainly for longer than twelve.This disposed of the
theory that he had been killed in the afternoon.Their belief was that
the crime was committed shortly after midnight.In that case Martin
Hartog must be incontestably innocent.He was able to account for
every hour of the previous day and night.He was out until near
midnight; he was accompanied home, and a friend sat up with him till
late, both keeping very quiet for fear of disturbing Patricia, who was
supposed to be asleep in her room, but who before that time had most
likely fled from her home.Moreover, it was proved that Martin Hartog
rose in the morning at a certain time, and that it was only then that
he became acquainted with the disappearance of his daughter.Father
Daniel and Gabriel Carew were present when the magistrate questioned
Hartog.The man seemed indifferent as to his fate, but he answered
quite clearly the questions put to him.He had not left his cottage
after going to bed on the previous night; he believed his daughter to
be in her room, and only this morning discovered his mistake.After
his interview with Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew he rushed from the
cottage in the hope of meeting with Emilius, whom he intended to kill;
he came upon the dead body of Eric in the woods, and his only regret
was that it was Eric and not Emilius."If the villain who has dishonoured me were here at this moment," said
Martin Hartog, "I would strangle him.No power should save him from my
just revenge!"The magistrate ordered him to be set at liberty, and he wandered out
of the court-house a hopeless and despairing man.Then the magistrate
turned to Carew, and asked him, now that Hartog was proved to be
innocent, what he had to reveal that might throw light upon the crime.Carew, after some hesitation, related what he had seen the night
before when Emilius and Eric were together in the forest."But," said the magistrate, "the brothers were known to be on the most
loving terms.""So," said Carew, "were their father, Silvain, and his brother Kristel
until a woman stepped between them.Upon this matter, however, it is
not for me to speak."I have heard something of the story of these hapless brothers," said
the magistrate, pondering, "but am not acquainted with all the
particulars.Carew then asked that he should be allowed to go for Doctor Louis, his
object being to explain to the doctor, on their way to the magistrate,
how it was that reference had been made to the story of Silvain and
Kristel which he had heard from the doctor's lips.He also desired to
hint to Doctor Louis that Lauretta might be in possession of
information respecting Eric and Emilius which might be useful in
clearing up the mystery."You have acted right," said Doctor Louis sadly to Gabriel Carew; "at
all risks justice must be done.And
is this to be the end of that fated family?I cannot believe that
Emilius can be guilty of a crime so horrible!"His distress was so keen that Carew himself, now that he was freed
from the jealousy by which he had been tortured with respect to
Lauretta, hoped also that Emilius would be able to clear himself of
the charge hanging over him.But when they arrived at the magistrate's
court they were confronted by additional evidence which seemed to tell
heavily against the absent brother.A witness had come forward who
deposed that, being out on the previous night very late, and taking a
short cut through the woods to his cottage, he heard voices of two men
which he recognised as the voices of Emilius and Eric.They were
raised in anger, and one--the witness could not say which--cried out,

"Well, kill me, for I do not wish to live!"Upon being asked why he did not interpose, his answer was that he did
not care to mix himself up with a desperate quarrel; and that as he
had a family he thought the best thing he could do was to hasten home
as quickly as possible.Having told all he knew he was dismissed, and
bade to hold himself in readiness to repeat his evidence on a future
occasion.Then the magistrate heard what Doctor Louis had to say, and summed up
the whole matter thus:

"The reasonable presumption is, that the brothers quarrelled over some
love affair with a person at present unknown; for although Martin
Hartog's daughter has disappeared, there is nothing as yet to connect
her directly with the affair.Whether premeditatedly, or in a fit of
ungovernable passion, Emilius killed his brother and fled.If he does
not present himself to-morrow morning in the village he must be sought
for.It was a melancholy night for all, to Carew in a lesser degree than to
the others, for the crime which had thrown gloom over the whole
village had brought ease to his heart.He saw now how unreasonable had
been his jealousy of the brothers, and he was disposed to judge them
more leniently.On that night Doctor Louis held a private conference with Lauretta,
and received from her an account of the unhappy difference between the
brothers.As Silvain and Kristel had both loved one woman, so had Eric
and Emilius, but in the case of the sons there had been no supplanting
of the affections.Emilius and Patricia had long loved each other, and
had kept their love a secret, Eric himself not knowing it.When
Emilius discovered that his brother loved Patricia his distress of
mind was very great, and it was increased by the knowledge that was
forced upon him that there was in Eric's passion for the girl
something of the fierce quality which had distinguished Kristel's
passion for Avicia.In his distress he had sought advice from
Lauretta, and she had undertaken to act as an intermediary, and to
endeavour to bring Eric to reason.On two or three occasions she
thought she had succeeded, but her influence over Eric lasted only as
long as he was in her presence.He made promises which he found it
impossible to keep, and he continued to hope against hope.Lauretta
did not know what had passed between the brothers on the previous
evening, in the interview of which I was a witness, but earlier in the
day she had seen Emilius, who had confided a secret to her keeping
which placed Eric's love for Patricia beyond the pale of hope.He was
secretly married to Patricia, and had been so for some time.When
Gabriel Carew heard this he recognised how unjust he had been towards
Emilius and Patricia in the construction he had placed upon their
secret interviews.Lauretta advised Emilius to make known his marriage
to Eric, and offered to reveal the fact to the despairing lover, but
Emilius would not consent to this being immediately done.He
stipulated that a week should pass before the revelation was made;
then, he said, it might be as well that all the world should know
it--a fatal stipulation, against which Lauretta argued in vain.Thus
it was that in the last interview between Eric and Lauretta, Eric was
still in ignorance of the insurmountable bar to his hopes.As it
subsequently transpired, Emilius had made preparations to remove
Patricia from Nerac that very night.Up to that point, and at that
time nothing more was known; but when Emilius was tried for the murder
Lauretta's evidence did not help to clear him, because it established
beyond doubt the fact of the existence of an animosity between the
brothers.On the day following the discovery of the murder, Emilius did not make
his appearance in the village, and officers were sent in search of
him.There was no clue as to the direction which he and Patricia had
taken, and the officers, being slow-witted, were many days before they
succeeded in finding him.Their statement, upon their return to Nerac
with their prisoner, was, that upon informing him of the charge
against him, he became violently agitated and endeavoured to escape.He denied that he made such an attempt, asserting that he was
naturally agitated by the awful news, and that for a few minutes he
scarcely knew what he was doing, but, being innocent, there was no
reason why he should make a fruitless endeavour to avoid an inevitable
inquiry into the circumstances of a most dreadful crime.No brother, he declared, had
ever been more fondly loved than Eric was by him, and he would have
suffered a voluntary death rather than be guilty of an act of violence
towards one for whom he entertained so profound an affection.In the
preliminary investigations he gave the following explanation of all
within his knowledge.What Lauretta had stated was true in every
particular; neither did he deny Carew's evidence nor the evidence of
the villager who had deposed that, late on the night of the murder,
high words had passed between him and Eric."The words," said Emilius, "'Well, kill me, for I do not wish to
live!'were uttered by my poor brother when I told him that Patricia
was my wife.For although I had not intended that this should be known
until a few days after my departure, my poor brother was so worked up
by his love for my wife, that I felt I dared not, in justice to him
and myself, leave him any longer in ignorance.For that reason, and
thus impelled, pitying him most deeply, I revealed to him the truth.Had the witness whose evidence, true as it is, seems to bear fatally
against me, waited and listened, he would have been able to testify in
my favour.My poor brother for a time was overwhelmed by the
revelation.His love for my wife perhaps did not die immediately away;
but, high-minded and honourable as he was, he recognised that to
persevere in it would be a guilty act.The force of his passion became
less; he was no longer violent--he was mournful.He even, in a
despairing way, begged my forgiveness, and I, reproachful that I had
not earlier confided in him, begged _his_ forgiveness for the
unconscious wrong I had done him.Then, after a while, we fell
into our old ways of love; tender words were exchanged; we clasped
each other's hand; we embraced.Truly you who hear me can scarcely
realise what Eric and I had always been to each other.More than
brothers--more like lovers.Heartbroken as he was at the conviction
that the woman he adored was lost to him, I was scarcely less
heartbroken that I had won her.And so, after an hour's loving
converse, I left him; and when we parted, with a promise to meet again
when his wound was healed, we kissed each other as we had done in the
days of our childhood."RICHARD CLAY AND SONS, LONDON AND BUNGAY.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Secret Inheritance  (Volume 2 of 3), by

    "This man is scarcely worthy aid;

          One loudly cried, "that speech we'll spare.But like the buttons on your back,
      We'll follow closely in your track,
    And do our part with willing hand,
    Without one doubting _if_ or _and_."Kind deeds the Brownies often do
      Unknown to me as well as you;
        The wounded hare, by hunters maimed,
          Is sheltered and supplied and tamed.The straying cat they sometimes find
                   Half-starved, and chased by dogs unkind,
                   And bring it home from many fears
                   To those who mourned its loss with tears.And to the bird so young and bare,
                                     With wings unfit to fan the air,
                                     That preying owls had thought to rend
                                     The Brownie often proves a friend.[Illustration]

                     Then bags and baskets were brought out
                     From barns and buildings round about,
                     With kettles, pans, and wooden-ware,
                     That prying eyes discovered there;
                     Nay, even blankets from the beds,
                     The pillow-slips, and table-spreads
    Were in some manner brought to light
    To render service through the night.[Illustration]

                   If there's a place where Brownies feel
                   At home with either hand or heel,
                   And seem from all restrictions free,
                   That place is in a branching tree.At times, with balance fair and fine
                   They held their stations in a line;
                   At times, in rivalry and pride
                   To outer twigs they scattered wide;
                   And oft with one united strain
                   They shook the tree with might and main,
    Till, swaying wildly to and fro,
    It rocked upon the roots below.So skilled at climbing were they all
    The sum of accidents was small:
    Some hats were crushed, some heads were sore,
    Some backs were blue, ere work was o'er;
                 For hands will slip and feet will slide,
                 And boughs will break and forks divide,
                 And hours that promise sport sublime
                 May introduce a limping time.So some who clambered up the tree
    With ready use of hand and knee,
    Found other ways they could descend
    Than by the trunk, you may depend.The startled birds of night came out
    And watched them as they moved about;
    Concluding thieves were out in force
    They cawed around the place till hoarse.But birds, like people, should be slow
    To judge before the facts they know;
                              For neither tramps nor thieves were here,
                              But Brownies, honest and sincere,
                              Who worked like mad to strip the trees
                              Before they felt the morning breeze.And well they gauged their task and time,
                              For ere the sun commenced to prime
                   The sky with faintest tinge of red
                   The Brownies from the orchard fled,
                   While all the fruit was laid with care
                   Beyond the reach of nipping air.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' [Illustration] YACHT-RACE.[Illustration]

    When fleets of yachts were sailing round
    The rippling bay and ruffled sound,
    And steering out where Neptune raves,
    To try their speed in rougher waves,
    The Brownies from a lofty place
    Looked out upon the novel race.Said one: "A race is under way.They'll start from somewhere in the bay,
    To leave the frowning forts behind,
    And Jersey headlands, as you'll find,
    And sail around, as I surmise,
    The light-ship that at anchor lies.All sails are spread, the masts will bend,
    For some rich prize they now contend--
    A golden cup or goblet fine,
    Or punch-bowl of antique design."Another said: "To-night, when all
    Have left the boats, we'll make a call,
    And boldly sail a yacht or two
    Around that ship, as people do.[Illustration]

    If I can read the signs aright
    That nature shows 'twill be a night
    When sails will stretch before the blast,
    And not hang idly round the mast."[Illustration]

    So thus they talked, and plans they laid,
    And waited for the evening shade.And when the lamps in city square
    And narrow street began to glare,
    The Brownies ventured from their place
    To find the yachts and sail their race.[Illustration]

    In equal numbers now the band,
    Divided up, the vessels manned.Short time they wasted in debate
    Who should be captain, cook, or mate;
    But it was settled at the start
    That all would take an active part,
    And be prepared to pull and haul
    If trouble came in shape of squall.For in the cunning Brownie crowd
    No domineering is allowed;
    All stand alike with equal power,
    And friendly feeling rules the hour.[Illustration]

    The Brownies' prophecy was true.That night the wind increased and blew,
    And dipped the sails into the wave,
    And work to every Brownie gave;
    Not one on board but had to clew,
    Or reef, or steer, or something do.Sometimes the yachts ran side by side
    A mile or more, then parted wide,
    Still tacking round and shifting sail
    To take advantage of the gale.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Sometimes a sloop beyond control
    At random ran, or punched a hole
    Clean through her scudding rival's jibs,
    Or thumped her soundly on the ribs.Of Brownies there were two or three
    Who tumbled headlong in the sea,
    While they performed some action bold,
    And failed to keep a proper hold.At first it seemed they would be lost;
    For here and there they pitched and tossed,
    Now on the crests of billows white,
    Now in the trough, clear out of sight,
    But all the while with valiant heart
    Performing miracles of art.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Some life-preservers soon were thrown;
    And ready hands let sails alone,
    And turned to render aid with speed
    To those who stood so much in need.But accident could not displace
    Or weaken interest in the race;
    And soon each active Brownie stood
    Where he could do the greatest good;
    It mattered not if shifting sail,
    Or at the helm, or on the rail.With arm to arm and hip to hip,
    They lay in rows to trim the ship.[Illustration]

    All hands were anxious to succeed
    And prove their yachts had greatest speed.But though we sail, or though we ride,
    Or though we sleep, the moments glide;
    And none must bear this fact in mind
    More constantly than Brownie kind.For stars began to lose their glow
    While Brownies still had miles to go.Said one, who scanned the eastern sky
    With doubtless an experienced eye:
    "We'll crowd all sail, for fear the day
    Will find us still upon the bay--
    Since it would prove a sad affair
    If morning light should find us there."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    But when the winds began to fail
    And lightly pressed the flapping sail,
    It was determined by the band
    To run their yachts to nearest land,
    So they could reach their hiding-place
    Before the sun revealed his face.[Illustration]

    By happy chance a cove they reached
    Where high and dry the boats were beached,
    And all in safety made their way
    To secret haunts without delay.[Illustration]




[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AT ARCHERY.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          One night the Brownies strayed around
          A green and level stretch of ground,
          Where young folk oft their skill displayed
          At archery, till evening's shade.The targets standing in the park,
          With arrows resting in the mark,
    Soon showed the cunning Brownie band
    The skill of those who'd tried a hand.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          A few in outer rings were fast,
          Some pierced the "gold," and more had passed
          Without a touch, until they sank
          In trunk of tree or grassy bank.Said one: "On page and parchment old,
          The story often has been told,
          How men of valor bent the bow
          To spread confusion through the foe.And even now, in later times
          (As travelers find in distant climes),
    Some savage tribes on plain and hill
    Can make it interesting still."Another spoke: "A scene like this,
    Reminds me of that valiant Swiss,
    Who in the dark and trying hour
    Revealed such nerve and matchless power,
          And from the head of his brave son
          The apple shot, and freedom won!While such a chance is offered here,
          We'll find the bows that must be near,
          And as an hour or two of night
          Will bring us 'round the morning light,
          We'll take such targets as we may,
            To safer haunts, some miles away.Then at our leisure we can shoot
            At bull's-eyes round or luscious fruit,
            Till like the Swiss of olden time,
            With steady nerves and skill sublime,
            Each one can split an apple fair
            On every head that offers there."[Illustration]

    Now buildings that were fastened tight
    Against the prowlers of the night,
    At the wee Brownies' touch and call
    Soon opened and surrendered all.So some with bulky targets strode,
    That made for eight or ten a load.And called for engineering skill
    To steer them up or down the hill;
    Some carried bows of rarest kind,
    That reached before and trailed behind.The English "self-yew" bow was there,
    Of nicest make and "cast" so rare,
    Well tipped with horn, the proper thing,
    With "nocks," or notches, for the string.Still others formed an "arrow line"
    That bristled like the porcupine.[Illustration]

    When safe within the forest shade,
    The targets often were displayed.At first, however near they stood,
    Some scattered trouble through the wood.The trees were stripped of leaves and bark,
    With arrows searching for the mark.The hares to other groves withdrew,
    And frighted birds in circles flew.But practice soon improves the art
        Of all, however dull or smart;
                             And there they stood to do their best,
                             And let all other pleasures rest,
                             While quickly grew their skill and power,
                             And confidence, from hour to hour.[Illustration]

    When targets seemed too plain or wide,
    A smaller mark the Brownies tried.By turns each member took his stand
    And risked his head to serve the band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For volunteers would bravely hold
    A pumpkin till in halves it rolled;
    And then a turnip, quince, or pear,
    Would next be shot to pieces there;
    Till not alone the apples flew
    In halves before their arrows true,
    But even plums and cherries too.For Brownies, as we often find,
    Can soon excel the human kind,
    And carry off with effort slight
    The highest praise and honors bright.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES FISHING.[Illustration]

    When glassy lakes and streams about
    Gave up their bass and speckled trout,
    The Brownies stood by water clear
    As shades of evening gathered near.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                          Said one: "Now country lads begin
                          To trim the rod and bend the pin
                          To catch the frogs and minnows spry
                          That in the brooks and ditches lie.While city chaps with reels come down,
                          And line enough to gird the town,
                          And flies of stranger shape and hue
                          Than ever Mother Nature knew--
                          With horns like crickets, tails like mice,
                          And plumes like birds of Paradise.Thus well prepared for sunny sky
              Or cloudy weather, wet or dry,
              They take the fish from stream and pool
              By native art and printed rule."Another said: "With peeping eyes
              I've watched an angler fighting flies,
              And thought, when thus he stood to bear
              The torture from those pests of air,
              There must indeed be pleasure fine
              Behind the baited hook and line.Now, off like arrows from the bow
    In search of tackle some must go;
    While others stay to dig supplies
    Of bait that anglers highly prize,--
    Such kind as best will bring the pout
    The dace, the chub, and'shiner' out;
    While locusts gathered from the grass
    Will answer well for thorny bass."Then some with speed for tackle start,
    And some to sandy banks depart,
              And some uplift a stone or rail
              In search of cricket, grub, or snail;
    While more in dewy meadows draw
    The drowsy locust from the straw.Nor is it long before the band
    Stands ready for the sport in hand.It seemed the time of all the year
    When fish the starving stage were near:
              They rose to straws and bits of bark,
              To bubbles bright and shadows dark,
              And jumped at hooks, concealed or bare,
              While yet they dangled in the air.Some Brownies many trials met
              Almost before their lines were wet;
              For stones below would hold them fast,
    And limbs above would stop the cast,
    And hands be forced to take a rest,
    At times when fish were biting best.Some stumbled in above their boots,
    And others spoiled their finest suits;
    But fun went on; for many there
    Had hooks that seemed a charm to bear,
    And fish of various scale and fin
    On every side were gathered in.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The catfish left his bed below,
    With croaks and protests from the go;
    And nerve as well as time it took
    From such a maw to win the hook.With horns that pointed every way,
    And life that seemed to stick and stay,
    Like antlered stag that stands at bay,
    He lay and eyed the Brownie band,
    And threatened every reaching hand.The gamy bass, when playing fine,
    Oft tried the strength of hook and line,
    And strove an hour before his mind
    To changing quarters was resigned.Some eels proved more than even match
    For those who made the wondrous catch,
        And, like a fortune won with ease,
        They slipped through fingers by degrees,
        And bade good-bye to margin sands,
        In spite of half a dozen hands.The hungry, wakeful birds of air
        Soon gathered 'round to claim their share,
        And did for days themselves regale
        On fish of every stripe and scale.Thus sport went on with laugh and shout,
        As hooks went in and fish came out,
        While more escaped with wounded gill,
        And yards of line they're trailing still;
        But day at length began to break,
        And forced the Brownies from the lake.[Illustration]




[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AT NIAGARA FALLS.[Illustration]

    The Brownies' Band, while passing through
    The country with some scheme in view,
    Paused in their race, and well they might,
    When broad Niagara came in sight.Said one: "Give ear to what I say,
    I've been a traveler in my day;
    I've waded through Canadian mud
    To Montmorenci's tumbling flood.Niagara is the fall
    That truly overtops them all--
    The children prattle of its tide,
    And age repeats its name with pride
    The school-boy draws it on his slate,
    The preacher owns its moral weight;
    The tourist views it dumb with awe,
    The Indian paints it for his squaw,
    And tells how many a warrior true
    Went o'er it in his bark canoe,
    And never after friend or foe
    Got sight of man or boat below."Another said: "The Brownie Band
    Upon the trembling brink may stand,
    Where kings and queens have sighed to be,
    But dare not risk themselves at sea."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        Some played along the shelving ledge
        That beetled o'er the river's edge;
        Some gazed in meditation deep
        Upon the water's fearful leap;
        Some went below, to crawl about
        Behind the fall, that shooting out
        Left space where they might safely stand
        And view the scene so wild and grand.Some climbed the trees of cedar kind,
        That o'er the rushing stream inclined,
    To find a seat, to swing and frisk
    And bend the boughs at fearful risk;
    Until the rogues could dip and lave
    Their toes at times beneath the wave.Still more and more would venture out
        In spite of every warning shout.At last the weight that dangled there
        Was greater than the tree could bear.And then the snapping roots let go
        Their hold upon the rocks below,
        And leaping out away it rode
        Upon the stream with all its load!Then shouts that rose above the roar
        Went up from tree-top, and from shore,
        When it was thought that half the band
        Was now forever leaving land.It chanced, for reasons of their own,
        Some men around that tree had thrown
        A lengthy rope that still was strong
        And stretching fifty feet along.Before it disappeared from sight,
        The Brownies seized it in their might,
        And then a strain for half an hour
        Went on between the mystic power
        Of Brownie hands united all,
        And water rushing o'er the fall.But true to friends the
        Brownies strained,
        And inch by inch the tree was gained.Across the awful bend it passed
        With those in danger clinging fast,
        And soon it reached the rocky shore
        With all the Brownies safe once more.And then, as morning showed her face,
        The Brownies hastened from the place.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' GARDEN.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                One night, as spring began to show
                In buds above and blades below,
                The Brownies reached a garden square
                That seemed in need of proper care.Said one, "Neglected ground like this
                Must argue some one most remiss,
                Or beds and paths would here be found
                Instead of rubbish scattered round.Old staves, and boots, and woolen strings,
                With bottles, bones, and wire-springs,
    Are quite unsightly things to see
    Where tender plants should sprouting be.This work must be progressing soon,
    If blossoms are to smile in June."A second said, "Let all give heed:
    On me depend to find the seed.For, thanks to my foreseeing mind,
    To merchants' goods we're not confined.Last autumn, when the leaves grew sere
    And birds sought regions less severe,
    One night through gardens fair I sped,
    And gathered seeds from every bed;
    Then placed them in a hollow tree,
    Where still they rest.So trust to me
    To bring supplies, while you prepare
    The mellow garden-soil with care."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Another cried, "While some one goes
    To find the shovels, rakes, and hoes,
    That in the sheds are stowed away,
    We'll use this plow as best we may.Our arms, united at the chain,
                Will not be exercised in vain,
                But, as if colts were in the trace,
    We'll make it dance around the place.I know how deep the share should go,
    And how the sods to overthrow.So not a patch of ground the size
    Of this old cap, when flat it lies,
    But shall attentive care receive,
                    And be improved before we leave."Then some to guide the plow began,
                    Others the walks and beds to plan.And soon they gazed with anxious eyes
                    For those who ran for seed-supplies.But, when they came, one had his say,
                    And thus explained the long delay:
                    "A woodchuck in the tree had made
                    His bed just where the seeds were laid.We wasted half an hour at least
                    In striving to dislodge the beast;
          Until at length he turned around,
          Then, quick as thought, without a sound,
          And ere he had his bearings got,
          The rogue was half across the lot."Then seed was sown in various styles,
    In circles, squares, and single files;
    While here and there, in central parts,
    They fashioned diamonds, stars, and hearts,
    Some using rake, some plying hoe,
    Some making holes where seed should go;
    While some laid garden tools aside
    And to the soil their hands applied.To stakes and racks more were assigned,
    That climbing-vines support might find.Cried one, "Here, side by side, will stand
    The fairest flowers in the land.The thrifty bees for miles around
    Ere long will seek this plot of ground,
    And be surprised to find each morn
    New blossoms do each bed adorn.And in their own peculiar screed
    Will bless the hands that sowed the seed."And while that night they labored there,
    The cunning rogues had taken care
    With sticks and strings to nicely frame
    In line the letters of their name.That when came round the proper time
    For plants to leaf and vines to climb,
    The Brownies would remembered be,
    If people there had eyes to see.But morning broke (as break it will
    Though one's awake or sleeping still),
    And then the seeds on every side
    The hurried Brownies scattered wide.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration: BROWNIE]

    Along the road and through the lane
    They pattered on the ground like rain,
    Where Brownies, as away they flew,
    Both right and left full handfuls threw,
    And children often halted there
    To pick the blossoms, sweet and fair,
    That sprung like daisies from the mead
    Where fleeing Brownies flung the seed.[Illustration]

[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' CELEBRATION.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        One night the Brownies reached a mound
        That rose above the country round.Said one, as seated on the place
        He glanced about with thoughtful face:
        "If almanacs have matters right
    The Fourth begins at twelve to-night,--
    A fitting time for us to fill
    Yon cannon there and shake the hill,
    And make the people all about
    Think war again has broken out.I know where powder may be found
              Both by the keg and by the pound;
              Men use it in a tunnel near
              For blasting purposes, I hear.To get supplies all hands will go,
    And when we come we'll not be slow
    To teach the folks the proper way
    To honor Independence Day."Then from the muzzle broke the flame,
                And echo answered to the sound
                That startled folk for miles around.'Twas lucky for the Brownies' Band
                They were not of the mortal brand,
                Or half the crew would have been hurled
                In pieces to another world.For when at last the cannon roared,
                So huge the charge had Brownies poured,
    The metal of the gun rebelled
    And threw all ways the load it held.The pieces clipped the daisy-heads
    And tore the tree-tops into shreds.But Brownies are not slow to spy
    A danger, as are you and I.[Illustration:

                For they through strange and mystic art
                Observed it as it flew apart,
                And ducked and dodged and flattened out,
                To shun the fragments flung about.Some rogues were lifted from their feet
    And, turning somersaults complete,
    Like leaves went twirling through the air
    But only to receive a scare;
    And ere the smoke away had cleared
    In forest shade they disappeared.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES IN THE SWIMMING-SCHOOL.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    While Brownies passed along the street,
    Commenting on the summer's heat
    That wrapped the city day and night,
    A swimming-bath appeared in sight.Said one: "Of all the sights we've found,
    Since we commenced to ramble round,
    This seems to better suit the band
    Than anything, however grand.We'll rest awhile and find our way
    Inside the place without delay,
    And those who understand the art,
    Can knowledge to the rest impart;
        For every one should able be,
        To swim, in river, lake, or sea.We never know how soon we may,
        See some one sinking in dismay,--
        And then, to have the power to save
    A comrade from a watery grave,
    Will be a blessing sure to give
    Us joy the longest day we live."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The doors soon opened through the power
    That lay in Brownie hands that hour.When once within the fun began,
    As here and there they quickly ran;
    Some up the stairs made haste to go,
    Some into dressing-rooms below,
    In bathing-trunks to reappear
    And plunge into the water clear;
    Some from the spring-board leaping fair
    Would turn a somersault in air;
    More to the bottom like a stone,
    Would sink as soon as left alone,
    While others after trial brief
    Could float as buoyant as a leaf.[Illustration]

    Some all their time to others gave
    Assisting them to ride the wave,
    Explaining how to catch the trick,
    Both how to strike and how to kick;
    And still keep nose above the tide,
    That lungs with air might be supplied.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Thus diving in and climbing out,
    Or splashing round with laugh and shout,
    The happy band in water played
    As long as Night her scepter swayed.They heard the clocks in chapel towers
    Proclaim the swiftly passing hours.But when the sun looked from his bed
    To tint the eastern sky with red,
    In haste the frightened Brownies threw
    Their clothes about them and withdrew.[Illustration: TIME FLIES]




THE BROWNIES [Illustration] AND THE WHALE.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As Brownies chanced at eve to stray
    Around a wide but shallow bay,
    Not far from shore, to their surprise,
    They saw a whale of monstrous size,
      That, favored by the wind and tide,
      Had ventured in from ocean wide,
      But waves receding by-and-by,
      Soon left him with a scant supply.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            At times, with flaps and lunges strong
            He worked his way some yards along,
            Till on a bar or sandy marge
            He grounded like a leaden barge."A chance like this for all the band,"
            Cried one, "but seldom comes to hand.I know the bottom of this bay
            Like those who made the coast survey.'Tis level as a threshing-floor
            And shallow now from shore to shore;
            That creature's back will be as dry
    As hay beneath a                  tropic sky,
    Till morning tide                 comes full and free
    And gives him aid                 to reach the sea."another cried;
    "Let all make haste               to gain his side
            Then clamber up as best we may,
            And ride him round till break of day."At once, the band in great delight
                         Went splashing through the water bright,
                         And soon to where he rolled about
                         They lightly swam, or waded out.Now climbing up, the Brownies tried
            To take position for the ride.Some lying down a hold maintained;
            More, losing place as soon as gained,
            Were forced a dozen times to scale
            The broad side of the stranded whale.Now half-afloat and half-aground
            The burdened monster circled round,
    Still groping clumsily about
    As if to find the channel out,
    And Brownies clustered close, in fear
    That darker moments might be near.And soon the dullest in the band
    Was sharp enough to understand
    The creature was no longer beached,
    But deeper water now had reached.For plunging left, or plunging right,
    Or plowing downward in his might,
    The fact was plain, as plain could be--
    The whale was working out to sea![Illustration]

    A creeping fear will seize the mind
    As one is leaving shores behind,
    And knows the bark whereon he sails
    Is hardly fit to weather gales.Soon Fancy, with a graphic sweep,
    Portrays the nightmares of the deep;
    While they can see, with living eye,
    The terrors of the air sweep by.[Illustration]

        For who would not a fierce bird dread,
        If it came flying at his head?And these were hungry, squawking things,
        With open beaks and flapping wings.They made the Brownies dodge and dip,
        Into the sea they feared to slip.The birds they viewed with chattering teeth,
    Yet dreaded more the foes beneath.The lobster, with his ready claw;
    The fish with sword, the fish with saw;
    The hermit-crab, in coral hall,
    Averse to every social call;
    The father-lasher, and the shrimp,
    The cuttle-fish, or ocean imp,
    All these increase the landsman's fright,
    As shores are fading out of sight.Such fear soon gained complete command
    Of every Brownie in the band.They looked behind, where fair and green
    The grassy banks and woods were seen.They looked ahead, where white and cold
    The foaming waves of ocean rolled,
    And then, with woful faces drew
    Comparisons between the two.[Illustration]

    Some blamed themselves for action rash
    Against all reason still to dash
    In danger's way, and never think
    Until they stood on ruin's brink.While others threw the blame on those
    Who did the risky trip propose.But meantime deep and deeper still
    The whale was settling down until
    His back looked like an island small
    That scarce gave standing-room to all.But, when their chance seemed slight indeed
    To sport again o'er dewy mead,
    The spouting whale, with movement strong,
    Ran crashing through some timbers long
    That lumbermen had strongly tied
    In cribs and rafts, an acre wide.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    'Twas then, in such a trying hour,
    The Brownies showed their nerve and power.The diving whale gave little time
    For them to choose a stick to climb,--
    But grips were strong; no hold was lost,
    However high the logs were tossed;
    By happy chance the boom remained
    That to the nearest shore was chained,
    And o'er that bridge the Brownies made
    A safe retreat to forest shade.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' KITES.[Illustration]

    The sun had hardly taken flight
    Unto the deepest caves of night;
    Or fowls secured a place of rest
    Where Reynard's paw could not molest,
    When Brownies gathered to pursue
    Their plans regarding pleasures new.Said one: "In spite of hand or string,
        Now hats fly round like crows in spring,
        Exposing heads to gusts of air,
    That ill the slightest draught can bear;
    While, high above the tallest tower,
    At morning, noon, and evening hour,
    The youngsters' kites with streaming tails
    Are riding out the strongest gales.The doves in steeples hide away
        Or keep their houses through the day,
        Mistaking every kite that flies
        For bird of prey of wondrous size."[Illustration]

        "You're not alone," another cried,
        "In taking note.I, too, have spied
        The boys of late, in street and court,
        Or on the roofs, at this fine sport;
        But yesternight I chanced to see
        A kite entangled in a tree.The string was nowhere to be found;
        The tail about a bough was wound.Some birds had torn the paper out,
        To line their nests, in trees about,
        But there beside the wreck I staid,
        Until I learned how kites are made.On me you safely may depend,
        To show the way to cut and bend.So let us now, while winds are high,
        Our hands at once to work apply;
        And from the hill that lifts its crown
        So far above the neighboring town,
        We'll send our kites aloft in crowds,
        To lose themselves among the clouds."A smile on every face was spread,
        At thought of fun like this, ahead;
        And quickly all the plans were laid,
        And work for every Brownie made.Some to the kitchens ran in haste,
        To manufacture pots of paste.Some ran for tacks or shingle-nails,
        And some for rags to make the tails,
        While more with loads of paper came,
        Or whittled sticks to make the frame.The strings, that others gathered, soon
        Seemed long enough to reach the moon.But where such quantities they found,
        'Tis not so easy to expound;--
        Perhaps some twine-shop, standing nigh,
        Was raided for the large supply;
        Perhaps some youthful angler whines
        About his missing fishing-lines.But let them find                   things where they will,
    The Brownies must                   be furnished still;
    And those who can't                 such losses stand,
    Will have to charge                 it to the Band.With busy fingers,                  well applied,
    They clipped and                    pasted, bent and tied;
    With paint and                      brush some ran about
    From kite to kite,                  to fit them out.On some they paint                  a visage fair,
    While others would                  affright a bear,
        Nor was it long (as one might guess
        Who knows what skill their hands possess)
        Before the kites, with string and tail,
        Were all prepared to ride the gale;
        And oh, the climax of their glee
        Was reached when kites were floating free!So quick they mounted through the air
        That tangling strings played mischief there,
    And threatened to remove from land
    Some valued members of the band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The birds of night were horrified
    At finding kites on every side,
    And netted strings, that seemed to be
    Designed to limit action free.But Brownies stood or ran about,
    Now winding up, now letting out;
    Now giving kites more tail or wing,
    Now wishing for a longer string;
    Until they saw the hints of day
    Approaching through the morning gray.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' DANCING-SCHOOL.[Illustration]

    When flitting bats commenced to wheel
    Around the eaves to find their meal,
    And owls to hoot in forests wide,
    To call their owlets to their side,
    The Brownie Band, in full array,
    Through silent streets pursued their way.But as they neared a building high,
    Surprise was shown in every eye.They heard the strains of music sweet,
    And tripping of the dancers' feet;
    While o'er the tap of heel and toe,
    The twang of harp and scrape of bow,
    Arose the clear and ringing call
    Of those who had control of all.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The Brownies slackened their swift pace,
    Then gathered closely round the place,
            To study out some way to win
            A peep or two at those within.Said one: "In matters of this kind
            Opinions differ, you will find.And some might say, with sober thought,
            That children should not thus be taught
            To hop around on toe and heel
            So actively to fiddle's squeal,
                For fear 'twould turn their minds away
                From graver duties of the day."Another said: "The dancing art
                Doth ease to every move impart.It gives alike to city-bred
                And country-born a graceful tread,
            And helps them bear themselves along
            Without offense in greatest throng.The nimble step, the springing knee,
    And balanced body all agree.The feet, my friends, may glide with grace
    As well as trudge from place to place.And in the parlor or without
    They best can stand or walk about
    Who found in early life a chance
    To mingle in the sprightly dance."[Illustration]

    The Brownies need no ladders long,
    No hoists, nor elevators strong,
    To lift them to an upper flight,
    A window-sill, or transom light.The weather-vane upon the spire,
    That overlooks the town entire,
    Is not too high above the base
    If fancy leads them to the place.'Tis said the very fleecy clouds
    They can bestride in eager crowds,
    Around the world their way to find,
    And leave the lagging winds behind.Said one: "We've scaled the dizzy heights
    Of mountain-peaks on other nights,
    And crossed the stream from shore to shore
    Where but the string-piece stretched before;
    And cunning Brownies, never fear,
    Will find some way to enter here."[Illustration]

    When once the Brownies' plans were laid,
    No formal, tiresome speech was made.In mystic ways, to Brownies known,
    They clambered up the walls of stone.They clung to this and that, like briers,
    They climbed the smooth electric wires;
    Some members lending ready aid
    To those who weaker nerves displayed.And in five minutes at the most,
    By vine, by bracket, and by post,
    By every scroll, and carving bold,
    That toes could touch or fingers hold
    They made their way, and gained a chance
    To view, unnoticed, every dance.Said one: "How pleasant is the sight
    To see those children young and bright
    While skipping blithely to and fro,
    Now joined in pairs, now in a row,
    Or formed in circles, hand in hand,
    And lightly moving at command--

[Illustration]

        Like butterflies through balmy air
        When summer spreads attractions fair,
    And blends with every whispering breeze
    The drowsy hum of working bees."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Another said: "When this is o'er
    The Brownie Band will take the floor.We'll bide our time and not be slow
            To take possession when they go.Then up and down the spacious hall
              We'll imitate the steps of all.We'll show that not in Frenchmen's bones
              Lies all the grace that nature owns;
              That others at the waltz can shine
              As well as Germans from the Rhine;
            That we some capers can enjoy
            As well as natives of Savoy."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            While thus they talked, the moments flew,
            And soon the master's task was through.When children's cloaks were wrapped around,
    And heavier shoes their feet had found
    They hastened home; but while they slept
    The Brownies in that building crept
    To take their turn at lively reel,
            At graceful glide, or dizzy wheel,
            Till all the dances people know,
              From Cuba's palms to Russia's snow
              Were tried, and soon in every case
              Were mastered with surprising grace.Imagine how they skipped about,
              And how they danced, with laugh and shout![Illustration]

[Illustration]

    No sooner had the Brownies run
    Into the hall than 'twas begun.Some round the harp, with cunning stroke,
    The music in the strings awoke.The violins to others fell,
    Who scraped, and sawed, and fingered well,
    Until the sweet and stirring air
    Would rouse the feet of dullest there.Like people in the spring of life,
    Of joys and countless blessings rife,
    Who yield themselves to Pleasure's hand--
    So danced that night the Brownie Band.First one would take his place to show
    The special step for heel or toe,
    Just how to edge about with care,
    And help around the partner fair,
    Nor plant his feet upon a dress--
    To cause confusion and distress.Then more would play the master's part,
    And give some lessons in the art:

[Illustration]

        Would show the rest some figures new
        From Turkey, China, or Peru.Now smoothly glide, as if on wings,
    Then bob around, as if on springs,
    Until the sprightly steps would call
    Loud acclamations from them all.They danced in twos with skip and bound,
    They danced in circles, round and round;
    They danced in lines that coiled about
    As runs the serpent in and out,
    Some moving slow, some standing still--
    More cutting capers with a will.At length, by joining hand in hand,
    The set included all the band.A happier crowd was never seen
    On ball-room floor or village green.By turns they danced, by turns would go
    And try their skill at string and bow--
    They almost sawed the fiddle through,
    So fast the bow across it flew.And louder still the harp would ring,
    As nimbler fingers plucked the string.Alike they seemed a skillful band
    Upon the floor or music-stand.The night wore on, from hour to hour,
    And still they danced with vim and power;
    For supple-kneed and light of toe
    The Brownies are, as well you know,
    And such a thing as tiring out
    Gives them but small concern, no doubt.As long as darkness hung her pall
    In heavy folds around the hall,
    The Brownies stayed to dance and play,
    Until the very break of day.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    To dance the figures o'er and o'er,
    They lingered on the polished floor;
    No sooner was one party done
    Than others the position won.They chose their partners for the set,
    And bowed, and scraped, and smiling, met.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As night advanced, and morning gray
    Nigh and still nigher cast its ray,
    The lively Brownies faster flew,
    Across and back, around and through;
    Now down the center, up the side,
    Then back to place with graceful glide--
                  Until it seemed that even day
                  Would hardly drive the band away.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                  At length some, more upon their guard
                  Against surprises, labored hard
    To urge their comrades from the place
    Before the sun would show his face.They pulled and hauled with all their might
    At those half crazy with delight,
                  Who still would struggle for a chance
                  To have, at least, another dance--
                  Some figure that was quite forgot,
                          Although "the finest of the lot."Another wished to linger still--
                          In spite of warning words--until
                          Each member present on the floor
                          Had been his partner twice or more.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Meantime, outside, the tell-tale dyes
                Of morn began to paint the skies,
                And, one by one, the stars of night
                Grew pale before the morning's light.Alone, bright Venus, in the west,
                Upheld her torch and warned the rest;
                While from the hedge the piping note
                Of waking birds began to float;
    And crows upon the wooded hills
    Commenced to stir and whet their bills,
    When Brownies scampered from the place,
    And undertook the homeward race.Nor made a halt in street or square,
    Or verdant park, however fair;
    But farther from the sight of man
    And light of day, they quickly ran.They traveled at their highest speed,
    And swiftly must they go, indeed;
    For, like the spokes of some great wheel,
    The rays of light began to steal
    Still higher up the eastern sky,
    And showed the sun was rolling nigh.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' CANDY-PULL.[Illustration]

    One evening, while the Brownies sat
    Enjoying free and friendly chat,
    Some on the trees, some on the ground,
    And others perched on fences round--
    One Brownie, rising in his place,
    Addressed the band with beaming face.The listeners gathered with delight
    Around the member, bold and bright,
    To hear him tell of scenes he'd spied
    While roaming through the country wide."Last eve," said he, "to shun the blast,
    Behind a cottage fence I passed.While there, I heard a merry rout,
    And as the yard was dark without,
    I crawled along through weeds and grass,
    Through melon-vines and broken glass,
    Until I might, unnoticed, win
    A glimpse of all the sport within.At length, below the window-pane,
                    To reach the sill I stretched in vain;
                    But, thanks to my inquiring mind
                    And sundry bricks, I chanced to find
    The facts I can relate in full
    About that lively candy-pull.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    "An hour or more, I well believe,
    I stood, their actions to perceive,
    With elbows resting on the sill,
    And nose against the window still.I watched them closely at their fun,
    And learned how everything was done.The younger members took the lead,
    And carried on the work with speed.With nimble feet they ran about
    From place to place, with laugh and shout;
    But older heads looked on the while,
    And cheered the youngsters with a smile,
    And gave advice in manner kind
    To guide the inexperienced mind.They placed the sugar in a pot,
    And stirred it round till boiling hot;
    Then rolled and worked it in their hands,
    And stretched it out in shining bands,
    Until it reached across the floor,
    From mantel-piece to kitchen door."These eyes of mine for many a night
    Have not beheld a finer sight.To pull the candy was the part
    Of some who seemed to know the art.The moon had slipped behind the hill,
    And hoarse had grown the whip-poor-will;
    But still, with nose against the pane,
    I kept my place through wind and rain.There, perched upon the shaky pile,
    With bated breath I gazed the while.I watched them with the sharpest sight
    That I might tell the tale aright;
    For all the active youngsters there
    Appeared to have of work their share.Some put fresh sugar in the pot,
    Some kept the fire blazing hot,
    And worked away as best they could
    To keep the stove well filled with wood.Indeed, ourselves, with all our skill,
    At moving here and there at will,
    Would have to 'lively' be and 'tear
    Around' to beat those children there!Some cut it up, more passed it round,
    While others ate it by the pound!"[Illustration]

    At this, a murmur of surprise
    On every side began to rise;
    Then smiles o'er every visage flitted,
    As wide as cheeks and ears permitted,
    That told what train of thought had sped
    At once through every Brownie's head--
    A thought of pleasure near at hand
    That well would suit the cunning band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            The Brownies act without delay
            When new ideas cross their way,
            And soon one raised a finger small
            And close attention gained from all.They crowded near with anxious glance
            To learn what scheme he could advance--
    What methods mention or employ
    To bring about the promised joy.Said he: "A vacant house is near.The owner leaves it every year
    For several months, and pleasure seeks
    On ocean waves or mountain peaks.The range is there against the wall,
            The pots, the pans, the spoons, and all,
            While cans of syrup may be found
            In every grocer's store around.The Brownie must be dull and tame,
            And scarce deserves to bear the name,
            Who will not join with heart and hand
            To carry out a scheme so grand."[Illustration]

    Another cried: "When to his bed
    The sun to-morrow stoops his head,
    Again we'll muster in full force
    And to that building turn our course."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            Next eve they gained the street at last
            That through the silent city passed;
            And soon they paused, their eyes they raised
            And on the vacant mansion gazed.In vain the miser hides his store,
    In vain the merchant bars his door,
    In vain the locksmith changes keys--
    The Brownies enter where they please.Through iron doors, through gates of brass,
    And walls of stone they safely pass,
    And smile to think how soon they can
    Upset the studied schemes of man.Within that house, without delay,
    Behind the guide they worked their way,
    More happy far and full of glee
    Than was the owner, out at sea.The whale, the shark, or fish that flies
    Had less attraction for his eyes
    Than had the shining candy-balls
    For Brownies, swarming through his halls.Soon coal was from the cellar brought
    And kindling wood came, quick as thought;
    Then pots and pans came rattling in
    And syrup sweet, in cans of tin.Just where the syrup had been found
    It matters not.The cunning band was soon possessed
    Of full supplies and of the best;
    Next tablespoons of silver fine
    In every hand appeared to shine,
    And ladles long, of costly ware,
    That had been laid away with care.No sooner was the syrup hot
    Than some around the kettle got,
    And dabbed away in eager haste
    To be the first to get a taste.Then some were scalded when the spoon
    Let fall its contents all too soon,
            And gave the tongue too warm a mess
            To carry without some distress.Then steps were into service brought
            That dancing-masters never taught,
            And smothered cries and swinging hand
            Would wake the wonder of the band.And when the candy boiled until
            It could be pulled and hauled at will,
    Take every shape or twist, and seem
    As free as fancy in a dream,
    The busy, happy-hearted crew
    Enjoyed the moments as they flew.The Brownies in the building stayed
    And candy ate as fast as made.But when at length the brightening sky
    Gave warning they must homeward fly,
    They quickly sought the open air
    And had but little time to spare.The shortest way, as often found,
    Was o'er the roughest piece of ground,
    Where rocks as large as houses lay
    All scattered round in wild array.Some covered o'er with clinging vines,
    Some bearing up gigantic pines,
    Or spreading oaks, that rooted fast,
    For centuries had stood the blast.But over all the rugged ground
    The Brownies passed with lightsome bound,
    Now jumping clear from block to block,
    Now sliding down the shelving rock,
    Or cheering on the lagging kind
    Who here and there would fall behind.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AND THE LOCOMOTIVE.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                One night the Brownies found their way
                To where some tracks and switches lay,
                And buildings stood, such as are found
    In every town on railroad ground.They moved about from place to place,
    With prying eyes and cautious pace
    They peeped in shops and gained a view,
    Where cars were standing bright and new;
    While others, that had service known,
    And in some crash were overthrown,
    On jack-screws, blocks, and such affairs,
    Were undergoing full repairs.The table that turns end for end
            Its heavy load, without a bend,
            Was next inspected through and through
            And tested by the wondering crew.They scanned the signal-lights with care
            That told the state of switches there,--
            Showed whether tracks kept straight ahead,
            Or simply to some siding led.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Then round a locomotive strong
                They gathered in an earnest throng,
                Commenting on the style it showed,
                Its strength and speed upon the road.Said one: "That 'pilot' placed before
                Will toss a cow a block or more;
            You'd hardly find a bone intact
            When such a thing her frame has racked--
            Above the fence, and, if you please,
            Above the smoke-stack and the trees
            Will go the horns and heels in air,
            When hoisted by that same affair.""Sometimes it saves," another cried,
            "And throws an object far aside
            That would to powder have been ground,
            If rushing wheels a chance had found.I saw a goat tossed from the track
            And landed on a farmer's stack,
            And though surprised at fate so strange,
            He seemed delighted at the change;
            And lived content, on best of fare,
            Until the farmer found him there."Another said: "We'll have some fun
    And down the road this engine run.The steam is up, as gauges show;
    She's puffing, ready now to go;
    The fireman and the engineer
    Are at their supper, in the rear
    Of yonder shed.I took a peep,
    And found the watchman fast asleep.So now's our time, if we but haste,
    The joys of railway life to taste.I know the engine-driver's art,
    Just how to stop, reverse, and start;
    I've watched them when they little knew
    From every move I knowledge drew;
    We'll not be seen till under way,
    And then, my friends, here let me say,
    The man or beast will something lack
    Who strives to stop us on the track."Then some upon the engine stepped,
    And some upon the pilot crept,
    And more upon the tender found
    A place to sit and look around.And soon away the engine rolled
    At speed 'twas fearful to behold;
    It seemed they ran, where tracks were straight,
    At least at mile-a-minute rate;
    And even where the curves were short
    The engine turned them with a snort
    That made the Brownies' hearts the while
    Rise in their throats, for half a mile.But travelers many dangers run
    On safest roads beneath the sun.They ran through yards, where dogs came out
    To choke with dust that whirled about,
    And so could neither growl nor bark
    Till they had vanished in the dark;
    Some pigs that wandered late at night,
    And neither turned to left nor right,
        But on the crossing held debate
        Who first should squeeze beneath the gate,
        Were helped above the fence to rise
        Ere they had time to squeal surprise,
        And never after cared to stray
        Along the track by night or day.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        But when a town was just in sight,
        And speed was at its greatest height,--
        Alas!that such a thing should be,--
        An open switch the Brownies see.Then some thought best at once to go
                        Into the weeds and ditch below;
                        But many on the engine stayed
                        And held their grip, though much dismayed.And waited for the shock to fall
                        That would decide the fate of all.In vain reversing tricks were tried,
                        And brakes to every wheel applied;
                        The locomotive forward flew,
                        In spite of all that skill could do.But just as they approached the place
                Where trouble met them face to face,
    Through some arrangement, as it seemed,
    Of which the Brownies never dreamed,
    The automatic switch was closed,
    A safety signal-light exposed,
    And they were free to roll ahead,
    And wait for those who'd leaped in dread;
    Although the end seemed near at hand
    Of every Brownie in the band,
    And darkest heads through horrid fright
    Were in a moment changed to white,
    The injuries indeed were small.A few had suffered from their fall,
    And some were sprained about the toes,
    While more were scraped upon the nose;
    But all were able to succeed
    In climbing to a place with speed,
    And there they stayed until once more
    They passed the heavy round-house door.Then jumping down on every side
    The Brownies scampered off to hide;
    And as they crossed the trestle high
    The sun was creeping up the sky,
    And urged them onward in their race
    To find some safe abiding place.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' FANCY BALL.[Illustration]

    It was the season of the year
    When people, dressed in fancy gear,
    From every quarter hurried down
    And filled the largest halls in town;
    And there to flute and fiddle sweet
    Went through their sets with lively feet.The Brownies were not slow to note
    That fun indeed was now afloat;
    And ere the season passed away,
    Of longest night and shortest day,
    They looked about to find a hall
    Where they could hold their fancy ball.Said one: "A room can soon be found
    Where all the band can troop around;
    But want of costumes, much I fear,
    Will bar our pleasure all the year."My eyes have not been shut of late,--
    Don't show a weak and hopeless mind
    Because your knowledge is confined,--

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For I'm prepared to take the band
    To costumes, ready to the hand,
    Of every pattern, new or old:
    The kingly robes, with chains of gold,
    The cloak and plume of belted knight,
    The pilgrim's hat and stockings white,
    The dresses for the ladies fair,
    The gems and artificial hair,
    The soldier-suits in blue and red,
    The turban for the Tartar's head,
    All can be found where I will lead,
    If friends are willing to proceed."[Illustration]

    Those knowing best the Brownie way
    Will know there was no long delay,
    Ere to the town he made a break
    With all the Brownies in his wake.It mattered not that roads were long,
    That hills were high or winds were strong;
    Soon robes were found on peg and shelf,
    And each one chose to suit himself.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The costumes, though a world too wide,
    And long enough a pair to hide,
    Were gathered in with skill and care,
    That showed the tailor's art was there.Then out they started for the hall,
    In fancy trappings one and all;
    Some clad like monks in sable gowns;
    And some like kings; and more like clowns;
    And Highlanders, with naked knees;
    And Turks, with turbans like a cheese;
    While many members in the line
    Were dressed like ladies fair and fine,
    And swept along the polished floor
    A train that reached a yard or more.[Illustration]

    By happy chance some laid their hand
    Upon the outfit of a band;
    The horns and trumpets took the lead,
    Supported well by string and reed;
    And violins, that would have made
    A mansion for the rogues that played,
    With flute and clarionet combined
    In music of the gayest kind.In dances wild and strange to see
    They passed the hours in greatest glee;
    Familiar figures all were lost
    In flowing robes that round them tossed;
    And well-known faces hid behind
    Queer masks that quite confused the mind.The queen and clown, a loving pair,
    Enjoyed a light fandango there;
    While solemn monks of gentle heart,
    In jig and scalp-dance took their part.The grand salute, with courteous words,
                The bobbing up and down, like birds,
                The lively skip, the stately glide,
                The double turn, and twist aside
                Were introduced in proper place
                And carried through with ease and grace.So great the pleasure proved to all,
    Too long they tarried in the hall,
    And morning caught them on the fly,
    Ere they could put the garments by!Then dodging out in great dismay,
            By walls and stumps they made their way;
            And not until the evening's shade
            Were costumes in their places laid.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AND THE TUGBOAT.[Illustration]

    While Brownies strayed along a pier
    To view the shipping lying near,
    A tugboat drew their gaze at last;
    'Twas at a neighboring wharf made fast.Cried one: "See what in black and red
    Below the pilot-house is spread!In honor of the Brownie Band,
    It bears our name in letters grand.Through all the day she's on the go;
    Now with a laden scow in tow,
    And next with barges two or three,
    Then taking out a ship to sea,
    Or through the Narrows steaming round
    In search of vessels homeward bound;
    She's stanch and true from stack to keel,
    And we should highly honored feel."Another said: "An hour ago,
    The men went up to see a show,
    And left the tugboat lying here.The steam is up, our course is clear,
    We'll crowd on board without delay
    And run her up and down the bay.We have indeed a special claim,
    Because she bears the 'Brownie' name.Before the dawn creeps through the east
    We'll know about her speed at least,
    And prove how such a craft behaves
    When cutting through the roughest waves.Behind the wheel I'll take my stand
    And steer her round with skillful hand,
    Now down the river, now around
    The bay, or up the broader sound;
    Throughout the trip I'll keep her clear
    Of all that might awaken fear.When hard-a-port the helm I bring,
    Or starboard make a sudden swing,
    The Band can rest as free from dread
    As if they slept on mossy bed.I something know about the seas,
    I've boxed a compass, if you please,
    And so can steer her east or west,
    Or north or south, as suits me best.Without the aid of twinkling stars
    Or light-house lamps, I'll cross the bars.I know when north winds nip the nose,
    Or sou'-sou'-west the 'pig-wind' blows,
    As hardy sailors call the gale
    That from that quarter strikes the sail."A third replied: "No doubt you're smart
    And understand the pilot's art,
    But more than one a hand should take,
    For all our lives will be at stake.In spite of eyes and ears and hands,
    And all the skill a crew commands,
    How oft collisions crush the keel
    And give the fish a sumptuous meal!Too many rocks around the bay
    Stick up their heads to bar the way.Too many vessels, long and wide,
    At anchor in the channel ride
    For us to show ourselves unwise
    And trust to but one pair of eyes."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long the tugboat swinging clear
    Turned bow to stream and left the pier,
    While many Brownies, young and old,
    From upper deck to lower hold
    Were crowding round in happy vein
    Still striving better views to gain.Some watched the waves around them roll;
    Some stayed below to shovel coal,
    From hand to hand, with pitches strong,
    They passed the rattling loads along.Some at the engine took a place,
    More to the pilot-house would race
    To keep a sharp lookout ahead,
    Or man the wheel as fancy led.But accidents we oft record,
    However well we watch and ward,
    And vessels often go to wreck
    With careful captains on the deck;
    They had mishaps that night, for still,
    In spite of all their care and skill,
    While running straight or turning round
    In river, bay, or broader sound,
    At times they ran upon a rock,
    And startled by the sudden shock
    Some timid Brownies, turning pale,
    Would spring at once across the rail;
    And then, repenting, find all hope
    Of life depended on a rope,
    That willing hands were quick to throw
    And hoist them from the waves below.Sometimes too near a ship they ran
    For peace of mind; again, their plan
    Would come to naught through lengthy tow
    Of barges passing to and fro.The painted buoys around the bay
    At times occasioned some dismay--
    They took them for torpedoes dread
    That might the boat in fragments spread,
    Awake the city's slumbering crowds,
    And hoist the band among the clouds.But thus, till hints of dawn appeared
    Now here, now there, the boat was steered
    With many joys and many fears,
    That some will bear in mind for years;
    But at her pier once more she lay
    When night gave place to creeping day.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' TALLY-HO.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As shades of evening closed around,
        The Brownies, from some wooded ground,
        Looked out to view with staring eye
        A Tally-Ho, then passing by.Around the park they saw it roll,
    Now sweeping round a wooded knoll,
    Now rumbling o'er an arching bridge,
    Now hid behind a rocky ridge,
    Now wheeling out again in view
    To whirl along some avenue.They hardly could restrain a shout
    When they observed the grand turnout.The long, brass horn, that trilled so loud,
    The prancing horses, and the crowd
                    Of people perched so high in air
                    Pleased every wondering Brownie there.Said one: "A rig like this we see
    Would suit the Brownies to a T!And I'm the one, here let me say,
    To put such pleasures in our way:
    I know the very place to go
    To-night to find a Tally-Ho.It never yet has borne a load
                    Of happy hearts along the road;
                    But, bright and new in every part
                    'Tis ready for an early start.The horses in the stable stand
                    With harness ready for the hand;
                    If all agree, we'll take a ride
                    For miles across the country wide."Another said: "The plan is fine;
                    You well deserve to head the line;
                    But, on the road, the reins I'll draw;
    I know the way to 'gee' and 'haw,'
    And how to turn a corner round,
    And still keep wheels upon the ground."Another answered: "No, my friend,
    We'll not on one alone depend;
    But three or four the reins will hold,
                    That horses may be well controlled.The curves are short, the hills are steep,
                    The horses fast, and ditches deep,
                    And at some places half the band
                    May have to take the lines in hand."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    That night, according to their plan,
    The Brownies to the stable ran;
    Through swamps they cut to reach the place,
    And cleared the fences in their race
      As lightly as the swallow flies
        To catch its morning meal supplies.Though, in the race, some clothes were soiled,
            And stylish shoes completely spoiled,
    Across the roughest hill or rock
    They scampered like a frightened flock,
    Now o'er inclosures knee and knee,
    With equal speed they clambered free
    And soon with faces all aglow
    They crowded round the Tally-Ho;
    But little time they stood to stare
    Or smile upon the strange affair.As many hands make labor light,
    And active fingers win the fight,
    Each busy Brownie played his part,
    And soon 't was ready for the start.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    But ere they took their seats to ride
    By more than one the horns were tried,
    Each striving with tremendous strain
    The most enlivening sound to gain,
    And prove he had a special right
    To blow the horn throughout the night.[Illustration]

    Though some were crowded in a seat,
    And some were forced to keep their feet
    Or sit upon another's lap,
    And some were hanging to a strap,
    With merry laugh and ringing shout,
    And tooting horns, they drove about.A dozen miles, perhaps, or more,
    The lively band had traveled o'er,
    Commenting on their happy lot
    And keeping horses on the trot,
    When, as they passed a stunted oak
    A wheel was caught, the axle broke![Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some went out with sudden pitch,
    And some were tumbled in the ditch,
    And one jumped off to save his neck,
    While others still hung to the wreck.Confusion reigned, for coats were rent,
    And hats were crushed, and horns were bent,
    And what began with fun and clatter
    Had turned to quite a serious matter.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                        Some blamed the drivers, others thought
                        The tooting horns the trouble brought.More said, that they small wisdom showed,
                        Who left the root so near the road.But while they talked about their plight
                        Upon them burst the morning light
                        With all the grandeur and the sheen
                          That June could lavish on the scene.So hitching horses where they could,
                                  The Brownies scampered for the wood.And lucky were the Brownies spry:
                                  A dark and deep ravine was nigh
                                  That seemed to swallow them alive
    So quick were they to jump and dive,
    To safely hide from blazing day
    That fast had driven night away,
    And forced them to leave all repairs
    To other heads and hands than theirs.THE BROWNIES ON

THE RACE-TRACK.[Illustration]

    While Brownies moved around one night
                    A seaside race-track came in sight."'T is here," said one, "the finest breed
                    Of horses often show their speed;
                    Here, neck and neck, and nose and nose,
                    Beneath the jockeys' urging blows,
                    They sweep around the level mile
                    The people shouting all the while;
    And climbing up or crowding through
    To gain a better point of view,
    So they can see beyond a doubt
    How favorites are holding out."Another said: "I know the place
    Where horses wait to-morrow's race;
    We'll strap the saddles on their back,
    And lead them out upon the track.Then some will act the jockey's part,
    And some, as judges, watch the start,
    And drop the crimson flag to show
    The start is fair and all must go."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long, the Brownies turned to haul
    Each wondering race-horse from his stall.They bridled them without delay,
        And saddles strapped in proper way.Some restless horses rearing there
        Would toss their holders high in air,
        And test the courage and the art
        Of those who took an active part.Said one: "I've lurked in yonder wood,
          And watched the races when I could.I know how all is done with care
              When thus for racing they prepare;
                How every buckle must be tight,
                And every strap and stirrup right,
    Or jockeys would be on the ground
    Before they circled half way round."When all was ready for the show
    Each Brownie rogue was nowise slow
    At climbing up to take a place
    And be a jockey in the race.Full half a dozen Brownies tried
    Upon one saddle now to ride;
    But some were into service pressed
    As judges to control the rest--
    To see that rules were kept complete,
    And then decide who won the heat.A dozen times they tried to start;
    Some shot ahead like jockeys smart,
    And were prepared to take the lead
    Around the track at flying speed.But others were so far behind,
    On horses of unruly mind,
    The judges from the stand declare
    The start was anything but fair.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        So back they'd jog at his command,
        In better shape to pass the stand.Indeed it was no simple trick
        To ride those horses, shy and quick,
        And only for the mystic art
        That is the Brownies' special part,
    A dozen backs, at least, had found
    A resting-place upon the ground.The rules of racing were not quite
    Observed in full upon that night.Around and round the track they flew,
    In spite of all the judge could do.The race, he tried to let them know,
    Had been decided long ago.But still the horses kept the track,
    With Brownies clinging to each back.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            Some racers of the jumping kind
            At times disturbed the riders' mind
            When from the track they sudden wheeled,
            And over fences took the field,
            As if they hoped in some such mode
            To rid themselves of half their load.But horses, howsoever smart,
        Are not a match for Brownie art,
    For still the riders stuck through all,
    In spite of fence, or ditch, or wall.Some clung to saddle, some to mane,
    While others tugged at bridle rein.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    So all the steeds found it would pay
    To let the Brownies have their way,
    Until a glimpse of rising sun
    Soon made them leave the place and run.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' BIRTHDAY DINNER.[Illustration]

    When people through the county planned
    To give their public dinners grand,
    The Brownies met at day's decline
    To have a birthday banquet fine."The proper things," a speaker cried,
    "Await us here on every side;
    We simply have to reach and take
    And choose a place to boil and bake.With meal and flour at our feet,
    And wells of water pure and sweet,
    That Brownie must be dull indeed
    Who lacks the gumption to proceed.We'll peel the pumpkins, ripened well,
    And scoop them hollow, like a shell,
    Then slice them up the proper size
    To make at length those famous pies,
    For which the people, small and great,
    Are ever quick to reach a plate."[Illustration]

    This pleased them all; so none were slow
    In finding work at which to go.A stove that chance threw in their way
    Was put in shape without delay.Though doors were cracked, and legs were rare,
                    The spacious oven still was there,
                    Where pies and cakes and puddings wide
                    Might bake together side by side.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

              The level top, though incomplete,
              Gave pots and pans a welcome seat,
              Where stews could steam and dumplings found
              A fitting place to roll around.Some lengths of pipe were raised on high
    That made the soot and cinders fly,
    And caused a draught throughout the wreck
    That door or damper failed to check.The rogues who undertook the part,
              That tries the cook's delightful art,
              Had smarting hands and faces red
              Before the table-cloth was spread;
                      But what cared they at such an hour
                      For singeing flame or scalding shower?Such ills are always reckoned slight
                      When great successes are in sight.There cakes and tarts and cookies fine,
                      Of both the "leaf" and "notched" design,
                      Were ranged in rows around the pan
                    That into heated ovens ran;
                    Where, in what seemed a minute's space,
                    Another batch would take their place;
                    While birds, that had secured repose
                    Above the reach of Reynard's nose,
                    Without the aid of wings came down
                    To be at midnight roasted brown.They found some boards and benches laid
                    Aside by workmen at their trade,
                    And these upon the green were placed
                    By willing hands with proper haste.Said one, who board and bench combined:
                    "All art is not to cooks confined,
                    And some expertness we can show
                    As well as those who mix the dough."And all was as the speaker said;
                In fact, they were some points ahead;
              For when the cooks their triumphs showed,
            The table waited for its load.The knives and forks and dishes white
        By secret methods came to light.Much space would be required to tell
    Just how the table looked so well;
    But kitchen cupboards, three or four,
    Must there have yielded up their store;
    For all the guests on every side
    With full equipments were supplied.When people find a carver hacked,
    A saucer chipped, or platter cracked,
    They should be somewhat slow to claim
    That servants are the ones to blame;
        For Brownies may have used the ware
      And failed to show the proper care.[Illustration]

     A few, as waiters, passed about
    New dishes when the old gave out,
     And saw the plates, as soon as bare,
      Were heaped again with something rare.No member, as you may believe,
        Was anxious such a place to leave,
                Until he had a taste at least
                Of all the dishes in the feast.The Brownies, when they break their fast,
                Will eat as long as viands last,
                And even birds can not depend
                On crumbs or pickings at the end:
                The plates were scraped, the kettles clean,
                And not a morsel to be seen,
                Ere Brownies from that table ran
                To shun the prying eyes of man.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' HALLOW-EVE.[Illustration]

    On Hallow-eve, that night of fun,
     When elves and goblins frisk and run,
       And many games and tricks are tried
         At every pleasant fireside,
        The Brownies halted to survey
       A village that below them lay,
      And wondered as they rested there
    To hear the laughter fill the air
    That from the happy children came
    As they enjoyed some pleasant game.Said one: "What means this merry flow
    That comes so loudly from below,
    Uncommon pleasures must abound
    Where so much laughter can be found."Another said: "Now, by your leave,
    I'll tell you 't is All-Hallow-eve,
    When people meet to have their sport
    At curious games of every sort;
    I know them all from first to last,
    And now, before the night has passed,
    For some convenient place we'll start
    Without delay to play our part."Two dozen mouths commenced to show
    Their teeth in white and even row;
    Two dozen voices cried with speed,
    "The plan is good we're all agreed."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    And in a trice four dozen feet
    Went down the hill with even beat.Without a long or wearying race
    The Brownies soon secured a place
    That answered well in every way
    For all the games they wished to play.There tubs of water could be found,
    By which to stoop or kneel around,
    And strive to bring the pennies out
    That on the bottom slipped about.Then heads were wet and shoulders, too,
    Where some would still the coin pursue,
    And mouth about now here and there
    Without a pause or breath of air
    Until in pride, with joyful cries,
    They held aloft the captured prize.More stood the tempting bait beneath,
    And with a hasty snap of teeth
    The whirling apple thought to claim
    And shun the while the candle's flame,--
    But found that with such pleasure goes
    An eye-brow singed, or blistered nose.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    More named the oats as people do
    To try which hearts are false, which true,
    And on the griddle placed the pair
    To let them part or smoulder there;
    And smiled to see, through woe or weal,
    How often hearts were true as steel.Still others tried to read their fate
    Or fortune in a dish or plate,
    Learn whether they would ever wed,
    Or lead a single life instead;
    Or if their mate would be a blessing,
    Or prove a partner most distressing.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then others in the open air,
    Of fun and frolic had their share;
    Played "hide and seek," and "blindman's buff,"
    And "tag" o'er places smooth or rough,
    And "snap the whip" and "trip the toe,"
    And games that none but Brownies know.As if their lives at stake were placed,
    They jumped around and dodged and raced,
    And tumbled headlong to the ground
    When feet some hard obstruction found;
    At times across the level mead,
    Some proved their special claims to speed,
    And as reward of merit wore
    A wreath of green till sport was o'er.The hours flew past as hours will
    When joys do every moment fill;
    The moon grew weak and said good-night,
    And turned her pallid face from sight;
    Then weakening stars began to fail,
    But still the Brownies kept the vale;
    Full many a time had hours retired
    Much faster than the band desired,
    And pleasure seemed too sweet to lay
    Aside, because of coming day,
      But never yet with greater pain
        Did they behold the crimson stain
          That morning spread along the sky,
            And told them they must homeward fly




THE BROWNIES' [Illustration] FLAG-POLE.[Illustration]

    The Brownies through a village bound,
    Paused in their run to look around,
    And wondered why the central square
    Revealed no flag-pole tall and fair.Said one: "Without delay we'll go
    To woods that stand some miles below.The tall spruce lifts its tapering crest
    So straight and high above the rest,
    We soon can choose a flag-pole there
    To ornament this village square.Then every one a hand will lend
    To trim it off from end to end,
    To peel it smooth and paint it white,
    And hoist it in the square to-night."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then to the woods the Brownies ran
    At once to carry out their plan;
    While some ran here and there with speed
    For implements to serve their need,
    Some rambled through the forest free
    To find the proper kind of tree,
    Then climbed the tree while yet it stood
    To learn if it was sound and good,
                                   Without a flaw, a twist, or bend,
                                   To mar its looks from end to end.When one was found that suited well,
                                   To work the active Brownies fell;
      And soon with sticks beneath their load,
      The band in grand procession strode;
        It gave them quite enough to do
        To safely put the project through,
        But when they reached the square, at last,
        Some ropes around the pole were passed
        And from the tops of maples tall
        A crowd began to pull and haul,
        While others gathered at the base
        Until the flag-pole stood in place.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For Brownies seldom idle stand
    When there is fun or work on hand.At night when darkness wraps us round
    They come from secret haunts profound,
    With brushes, pots of paint, and all,
    They clamber over fence and wall;
    And soon on objects here and there
    That hold positions high in air,
    And most attract the human eye,
    The marks of Brownie fingers lie.Sometimes with feet that never tire
    They climb the tall cathedral spire;
    When all the town is still below,
    Save watchmen pacing to and fro,
    By light of moon, and stars alone,
    They dust the marble and the stone,
          And with their brushes, small and great,
          They paint and gild the dial-plate;
          And bring the figures plain in sight
          That all may note Time's rapid flight.And accidents they often know
          While through the heavy works they go,
          Where slowly turning wheels at last
          In bad position hold them fast.But Brownies, notwithstanding all
          The hardships that may them befall,
          Still persevere in every case
          Till morning drives them from the place.And then with happy hearts they fly
          To hide away from human eye.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES ON THE CANAL.[Illustration]

    One night the Brownies stood beside
    A long canal, whose silent tide
    Connected seaboard cities great
    With inland sections of the state.The laden boats, so large and strong,
    Were tied to trees by hawsers long;
    No boatmen stood by helm or oar,
    No mules were tugging on the shore;
    All work on land and water too
    Had been abandoned by the crew.Said one: "We see, without a doubt,
    What some dispute has brought about.Perhaps a strike for greater pay,
    For even rates, or shorter day,
    Has caused the boats to loiter here
    With cargoes costing some one dear.These cabbages so large and round
    Should, long ere this, the dish have found,
    Upon some kitchen-stove or range
    To spread an odor rich and strange;
    Those squashes, too, should not be lost
    By long exposure to the frost,
    When they would prove so great a prize
    To old and young, if baked in pies.And then those pippins, ripe and fair,
    From some fine orchard picked with care,
                    Should not to rot and ruin go,
                    Though work is hard or wages low,
                    When thousands would be glad to stew
                    The smallest apples there in view."[Illustration]

    Another said: "We lack the might
    To set the wrongs of labor right,
    But by the power within us placed
    We'll see that nothing goes to waste.So every hand must be applied
    That boats upon their way may glide."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some ran here and there with speed
    To find a team to suit their need.A pair of mules, that grazed about
    The grassy banks, were fitted out
                With straps and ropes without delay
                To start the boats upon their way;
                And next some straying goats were found,
                Where in a yard they nibbled round
                Destroying plants of rarest kind
                That owners in the town could find.Soon, taken from their rich repast,
    They found themselves in harness fast;
    Then into active service pressed
    They trod the tow-path with the rest.[Illustration]

    On deck some Brownies took their stand
    To man the helm, or give command,
    And oversee the work; while more
    Stayed with the teams upon the shore.At times the rope would drag along
            And catch on snags or branches long,
                    And cause delays they ill could bear,
                    For little time they had to spare.[Illustration]

            With accidents they often met,
            And some were bruised and more were wet;
            Some tumbled headlong down the hold;
            And some from heaping cargoes rolled.But what care Brownies for a bruise,
            Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,
            When enterprises bold and new
    Must ere the dawn be carried through?If half the band were drenched, no doubt
    The work would still be carried out,
    For extra strength would then be found
    In those who still were safe and sound.was the shout
    They stood and stared or ran about
    Till in the water, heels o'er head,
    Some members of the band were spread.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    A few could swim, and held their own;
    But more went downward like a stone
    Until, without the plummet's aid,
            They learned how deep canals are made.In spite of all the kicks and flings
            That fright at such a moment brings,
    Through lack of art, or weight of fear,
    It looked as if their end was near.The order now to stop the team
    Would pass along with sign and scream,
    And those on land would know by this
    That something startling was amiss;
    And those on board could plainly see
    Unless assistance there could be,
    In shape of ropes and fingers strong,
    There'd be some vacancies, ere long![Illustration]

    By chance a net was to be had,
    That boatmen used for catching shad--
    A gill-net of the strongest kind,
    For heavy catches well designed;
    Few shad against its meshes ran
    But left their bones on some one's pan,
    This bulky thing the active crew
    Far overboard with promptness threw.A hold at once some Brownies found,
    While others in its folds were bound,
    Until like fish in great dismay
    Inside the net they struggling lay.But willing hands were overhead,
    And quickly from the muddy bed
    Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled
    The dripping net was upward hauled,
    With all the Brownies clinging fast,
    Till safe on deck they stood at last.[Illustration]

                    Sometimes a mule fell off the road
                    And in the stream with all its load.Then precious time would be consumed
    Before the trip could be resumed.Thus on they went from mile to mile,
    With many strange mishaps the while,
    But working bravely through the night
    Until the city came in sight.Said one: "Now, thanks to bearded goats
    And patient mules, the heavy boats
    For hours have glided on their way,
    And reached the waters of the bay.But see, the sun's about to show
    His colors to the world below,
    And other birds than those of night
    Begin to take their morning flight.Our time is up; we've done our best;
    The ebbing tide must do the rest;
    Now drifting downward to their pier
    Let barges unassisted steer,
    While we make haste, with nimble feet,
    To find in woods a safe retreat."[Illustration]

[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES IN THE STUDIO.The Brownies once approached in glee
    A slumbering city by the sea."In yonder town," the leader cried,
    "I hear the artist does reside
    Who pictures out, with patient hand,
    The doings of the Brownie band.""I'd freely give," another said,
    "The cap that now protects my head,
    To find the room, where, day by day,
    He shows us at our work or play."A third replied: "Your cap retain
    To shield your poll from snow or rain.His studio is farther down,
    Within a corner-building brown.So follow me a mile or more
    And soon we'll reach the office door."[Illustration]

    Then through the park, around the square,
    And down the broadest thoroughfare,
    The anxious Brownies quickly passed,
    And reached the building huge at last.[Illustration]

        They paused awhile to view the sight,
        To speak about its age and height,
        And read the signs, so long and wide,
        That met the gaze on every side.But little time was wasted there,
                For soon their feet had found the stair.And next the room, where oft are told
                Their funny actions, free and bold,
                Was honored by a friendly call
                From all the Brownies, great and small.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Then what a gallery they found,
                As here and there they moved around--
                For now they gaze upon a scene
                That showed them sporting on the green;
                Then, hastening o'er the fields with speed
                To help some farmer in his need.Said one, "Upon this desk, no doubt,
                Where now we cluster round about,
                Our doings have been plainly told
    From month to month, through heat and cold.And there's the ink, I apprehend,
    On which our very lives depend.Be careful, moving to and fro,
    Lest we upset it as we go.For who can tell what tales untold
            That darksome liquid may unfold!"[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            A telephone gave great delight
            To those who tried it half the night,
            Some asking after fresh supplies;
    Or if their stocks were on the rise;
    What ship was safe; what bank was firm;
    Or who desired a second term.Thus messages ran to and fro
    With "Who are you?"And all the repetitions known
    To those who use the telephone.[Illustration]

    "Oh, here's the pen, as I opine,"
    Said one, "that's written every line;
    Indebted to this pen are we
    For all our fame and history.""See here," another said, "I've found
    The pointed pencil, long and round,
    That pictures all our looks so wise,
            Our smiles so broad and staring eyes;
            'Tis well it draws us all aright,
            Or we might bear it off to-night.But glad are we to have our name
            In every region known to fame,
            To know that children lisp our praise,
            And on our faces love to gaze."Old pistols that brave service knew
    At Bunker Hill, were brought to view
    In mimic duels on the floor,
    And snapped at paces three or four;
    While from the foils the Brownies plied,
    The sparks in showers scattered wide,
    As thrust and parry, cut and guard,
    In swift succession followed hard.The British and Mongolian slash
    Were tried in turn with brilliant dash,
    Till foils, and skill, and temper too,
    Were amply tested through and through.[Illustration]

    They found old shields that bore the dint
    Of spears and arrow-heads of flint,
    And held them up in proper pose;
    Then rained upon them Spartan blows.[Illustration]

    Lay figures, draped in ancient styles,
    From some drew graceful bows and smiles,
    Until the laugh of comrades nigh
    Led them to look with sharper eye.A portrait now they criticize,
    Which every one could recognize:
    The features, garments, and the style,
    Soon brought to every face a smile.Some tried a hand at painting there,
    And showed their skill was something rare;
    While others talked and rummaged through
    The desk to find the stories new,
    That told about some late affair,
    Of which the world was not aware.But pleasure seemed to have the power
    To hasten every passing hour,
    And bring too soon the morning chime,
    However well they note the time.Now, from a chapel's brazen bell,
    The startling hint of morning fell,
    And Brownies realized the need
    Of leaving for their haunts with speed.So down the staircase to the street
    They made their way with nimble feet,
    And ere the sun could show his face,
    The band had reached a hiding-place.Her brown eyes
are ablaze with excitement, and her cheeks aglow.“And I’ll be there
to watch dad too, you know,” she adds persuasively in a voice which
expresses the belief that not much danger can possibly come to dad
while his little girl is near.Dick has brought Smuttie round to the garden-gate, and in a moment he
and his little mistress are off, cantering as fast as Smuttie can be
got to go, to the scene of the fire.Those who have witnessed a fire in the bush will never forget it.The
first spark, induced sometimes by a fallen match, ignited often by the
excessive heat of the sun’s rays, gains ground with appalling rapidity,
and where the growth is dry, large tracts of ground have often been
laid waste.In excessively hot weather this is more particularly the
case, and it is then found almost impossible to extinguish the fire.“Look at it!” Dick cries excitedly.“Goin’ like a steam-engine just.Wish we hadn’t brought Smuttie, Miss Ruby.He’ll maybe be frightened at
the fire.they’ve got the start of it.Do you see that other fire
on ahead?That’s where they’re burning down!”

Ruby looks.Yes, there _are_ two fires, both, it seems, running, as
Dick has said, “like steam-engines.”

“My!” the boy cries suddenly; “it’s the old wicked one’s house.It’s it
that has got afire.There’s not enough
of them to do that, and to stop the fire too.And it’ll be on to your
pa’s land if they don’t stop it pretty soon.I’ll have to help them,
Miss Ruby.You’ll have to get off Smuttie and hold
him in case he gets scared at the fire.”

“Oh, Dick!” the little girl cries.Her face is very pale, and her eyes
are fixed on that lurid light, ever growing nearer.“Do you think
he’ll be dead?Do you think the old man’ll be dead?”

“Not him,” Dick returns, with a grin.“He’s too bad to die, he is.but I wish he was dead!” the boy ejaculates.“It would be a good
riddance of bad rubbish, that’s what it would.”

“Oh, Dick,” shivers Ruby, “I wish you wouldn’t say that.I’ve never been kind!” Ruby
breaks out in a wail, which Dick does not understand.They are nearing the scene of the fire now.Luckily the cottage is
hard by the river, so there is no scarcity of water.Stations are scarce and far between in the
Australian bush, and the inhabitants not easily got together.There are
two detachments of men at work, one party endeavouring to extinguish
the flames of poor old Davis’s burning cottage, the others far in
the distance trying to stop the progress of the fire by burning down
the thickets in advance, and thus starving the main fire as it gains
ground.This method of “starving the fire” is well known to dwellers in
the Australian bush, though at times the second fire thus given birth
to assumes such proportions as to outrun its predecessor.“It’s not much use.It’s too dry,” Dick mutters.“I don’t like leaving
you, Miss Ruby; but I’ll have to do it.Even a boy’s a bit of help in
bringing the water.You don’t mind, do you, Miss Ruby?I think, if I
was you, now that you’ve seen it, I’d turn and go home again.Smuttie’s
easy enough managed; but if he got frightened, I don’t know what you’d
do.”

“I’ll get down and hold him,” Ruby says.“I want to watch.” Her heart
is sick within her.She has never seen a fire before, and it seems so
fraught with danger that she trembles when she thinks of dad, the being
she loves best on earth.“Go you away to the fire, Dick,” adds Ruby,
very pale, but very determined.“I’m not afraid of being left alone.”

The fire is gaining ground every moment, and poor old Davis’s desolate
home bids fair to be soon nothing but a heap of blackened ruins.Dick gives one look at the burning house, and another at his little
mistress.There is no time to waste if he is to be of any use.“I don’t like leaving you, Miss Ruby,” says Dick again; but he goes all
the same.Ruby, left alone, stands by Smuttie’s head, consoling that faithful
little animal now and then with a pat of the hand.It is hot,
scorchingly hot; but such cold dread sits at the little girl’s heart
that she does not even feel the heat.In her ears is the hissing of
those fierce flames, and her love for dad has grown to be a very agony
in the thought that something may befall him.“Ruby!” says a well-known voice, and through the blaze of sunlight she
sees her father coming towards her.His face, like Ruby’s, is very
pale, and his hands are blackened with the grime and soot.“You ought
not to be here, child.Away home to your mother,
and tell her it is all right, for I know she will be feeling anxious.”

“But is it all right, dad?” the little girl questions anxiously.Her
eyes flit from dad’s face to the burning cottage, and then to those
other figures in the lurid light far away.“And mamma _will_ be
frightened; for she’ll think you’ll be getting hurt.And so will I,”
adds poor Ruby with a little catch in her voice.“What nonsense, little girl,” says her father cheerfully.“There,
dear, I have no time to wait, so get on Smuttie, and let me see you
away.That’s a brave little girl,” he adds, stooping to kiss the small
anxious face.It is with a sore, sore heart that Ruby rides home lonely by the
river’s side.She has not waited for her trouble to come to her, but
has met it half way, as more people than little brown-eyed Ruby are too
fond of doing.Dad is the very dearest thing Ruby has in the whole wide
world, and if anything happens to dad, whatever will she do?“I just couldn’t bear it,” murmurs poor Ruby, wiping away a very big
tear which has fallen on Smuttie’s broad back.Ah, little girl with the big, tearful, brown eyes, you have still to
learn that any trouble can be borne patiently, and with a brave face to
the world, if only God gives His help![Illustration]

CHAPTER VI.“I CAN NEVER DO IT NOW!”

          “Then, darling, wait;
          Nothing is late,
  In the light that shines for ever!”


That is a long, long day to Ruby.From Glengarry they can watch far
away the flames, like so many forked and lurid tongues of fire, leaping
up into the still air and looking strangely out of place against
the hazy blue of the summer sky.The little girl leaves her almost
untouched dinner, and steals out to the verandah, where she sits, a
forlorn-looking little figure, in the glare of the afternoon sunshine,
with her knees drawn up to her chin, and her brown eyes following
eagerly the pathway by the river where she has ridden with Dick no
later than this morning.This morning!--to waiting Ruby it seems more
like a century ago.Jenny finds her there when she has washed up the dinner dishes, tidied
all for the afternoon, and come out to get what she expresses as a
“breath o’ caller air,” after her exertions of the day.The “breath
o’ air” Jenny may get; but it will never be “caller” nor anything
approaching “caller” at this season of the year.Poor Jenny, she may
well sigh for the fresh moorland breezes of bonnie Scotland with its
shady glens, where the bracken and wild hyacinth grow, and where the
very plash of the mountain torrent or “sough” of the wind among the
trees, makes one feel cool, however hot and sultry it may be.“Ye’re no cryin’, Miss Ruby?” ejaculates Jenny.“No but that the heat
o’ this outlandish place would gar anybody cry.What’s wrong wi’ ye, ma
lambie?” Jenny can be very gentle upon occasion.“Are ye no weel?” For
all her six years of residence in the bush, Jenny’s Scotch tongue is
still aggressively Scotch.Ruby raises a face in which tears and smiles struggle hard for mastery.“I’m not crying, _really_, Jenny,” she answers.“Only,” with a
suspicious droop of the dark-fringed eye-lids and at the corners of the
rosy mouth, “I was pretty near it.I can’t help watching the flames, and thinking that something might
perhaps be happening to him, and me not there to know.And then I began
to feel glad to think how nice it would be to see him and Dick come
riding home.Jenny, how _do_ little girls get along who have no
father?”

It is strange that Ruby never reflects that her own mother has gone
from her.“The Lord A’mighty tak’s care o’ such,” Jenny responds solemnly.“Ye’ll just weary your eyes glowerin’ awa’ at the fire like that, Miss
Ruby.They say that ‘a watched pot never boils,’ an’ I’m thinkin’ your
papa’ll no come a meenit suner for a’ your watchin’.Gae in an’ rest
yersel’ like the mistress.She’s sleepin’ finely on the sofa.”

Ruby gives a little impatient wriggle.“How can I, Jenny,” she exclaims
piteously, “when dad’s out there?I don’t know whatever I would do
if anything was to happen to dad.”

“Pit yer trust in the Lord, ma dearie,” the Scotchwoman says
reverently.“Ye’ll be in richt gude keepin’ then, an’ them ye love as
weel.”

But Ruby only wriggles again.She does not want Jenny’s solemn talk.Dad, whom she loves so dearly, and whose little
daughter’s heart would surely break if aught of ill befell him.So the long, long afternoon wears away, and when is an afternoon so
tedious as when one is eagerly waiting for something or some one?Jenny goes indoors again, and Ruby can hear the clatter of plates and
cups echoing across the quadrangle as she makes ready the early tea.The child’s eyes are dim with the glare at which she has so long been
gazing, and her limbs, in their cramped position, are aching; but Ruby
hardly seems to feel the discomfort from which those useful members
suffer.She goes in to tea with a grudge, listens to her stepmother’s
fretful little complaints with an absent air which shows how far away
her heart is, and returns as soon as she may to her point of vantage.“Oh, me!” sighs the poor little girl.“Will he never come?”

Out in the west the red sun is dying grandly in an amber sky, tinged
with the glory of his life-blood, when dad at length comes riding home.Ruby has seen him far in the distance, and runs out past the gate to
meet him.“Oh, dad darling!” she cries.“I did think you were never coming.Oh,
dad, are you hurt?” her quick eyes catching sight of his hand in a
sling.“Only a scratch, little girl,” he says.“Don’t
frighten the mother about it.Poor little Ruby red, were you
frightened?Did you think your old father was to be killed outright?”

“I didn’t know,” Ruby says.“And mamma was
frightened too.And when even Dick didn’t come back.Oh, dad, wasn’t it
just dreadful--the fire, I mean?”

Black Prince has been put into the paddock, and Ruby goes into the
house, hanging on her father’s uninjured arm.The child’s heart has
grown suddenly light.The terrible fear which has been weighing her
down for the last few hours has been lifted, and Ruby is her old joyous
self again.“Dad,” the little girl says later on.They are sitting out on the
verandah, enjoying the comparative cool of the evening.“What will
he do, old Davis, I mean, now that his house is burnt down?It won’t
hardly be worth while his building another, now that he’s so old.”

Dad does not answer just for a moment, and Ruby, glancing quickly
upwards, almost fancies that her father must be angry with her; his
face is so very grave.Perhaps he does not even wish her to mention the
name of the old man, who, but that he is “so old,” should now have been
in prison.“Old Davis will never need another house now, Ruby,” Dad answers,
looking down into the eager little upturned face.God has taken him away, dear.”

“He’s dead?” Ruby questions with wide-open, horror-stricken eyes.The little girl hardly hears her father as he goes on to tell her how
the old man’s end came, suddenly and without warning, crushing him in
the ruins of his burning cottage, where the desolate creature died
as he had lived, uncared for and alone.Into Ruby’s heart a great,
sorrowful regret has come, regret for a kind act left for ever undone,
a kind word for ever unspoken.“And I can never do it now!” the child sobs.“He’ll never even know I
wanted to be kind to him!”

“Kind to whom, little girl?” her father asks wonderingly.And it is in those kind arms that Ruby sobs out her story.“I can never
do it now!” that is the burden of her sorrow.The late Australian twilight gathers round them, and the stars twinkle
out one by one.But, far away in the heaven which is beyond the stars
and the dim twilight of this world, I think that God knows how one
little girl, whose eyes are now dim with tears, tried to be “kind,”
and it may be that in His own good time--and God’s time is always the
best--He will let old Davis “know” also.[Illustration]




CHAPTER VII.“There came a glorious morning, such a one
  As dawns but once a season.Mercury
  On such a morning would have flung himself
  From cloud to cloud, and swum with balanced wings
  To some tall mountain: when I said to her,
  ‘A day for gods to stoop,’ she answered ‘Ay,
  And men to soar.’”

                                          TENNYSON.Ruby goes about her work and play very gravely for the next few days.A great sorrow sits at her heart which only time can lighten and chase
away.She is very lonely, this little girl--lonely without even knowing
it, but none the less to be pitied on that account.To her step-mother
Ruby never even dreams of turning for comfort or advice in her small
troubles and griefs.Dad is his little girl’s _confidant_; but, then,
dad is often away, and in Mrs.Thorne’s presence Ruby never thinks of
confiding in her father.It is a hot sunny morning in the early months of the new year.Ruby is
riding by her father’s side along the river’s bank, Black Prince doing
his very best to accommodate his long steps to Smuttie’s slower amble.Far over the long flats of uncultivated bush-land hangs a soft blue
haze, forerunner of a day of intense heat.But Ruby and dad are early
astir this morning, and it is still cool and fresh with the beautiful
young freshness of a glorious summer morning.“It’s lovely just now,” Ruby says, with a little sigh of satisfaction.“I wish it would always stay early morning; don’t you, dad?It’s like
where it says in the hymn about ‘the summer morn I’ve sighed for.’
P’raps that means that it will always be morning in heaven.I hope it
will.”

“It will be a very fair summer morn anyway, little girl,” says dad, a
sudden far-away look coming into his brown eyes.At the child’s words, his thoughts have gone back with a sudden rush of
memory to another summer’s morning, long, long ago, when he knelt by
the bedside where his young wife lay gasping out her life, and watched
Ruby’s mother go home to God.“I’ll be waiting for you, Will,” she had
whispered only a little while before she went away.“It won’t be so
very long, my darling; for even heaven won’t be quite heaven to me with
you away.” And as the dawning rose over the purple hill-tops, and the
birds’ soft twitter-twitter gave glad greeting to the new-born day, the
angels had come for Ruby’s mother, and the dawning for her had been the
glorious dawning of heaven.Many a year has passed away since then, sorrowfully enough at first for
the desolate husband, all unheeded by the child, who never missed her
mother because she never knew her.Nowadays new hopes, new interests
have come to Will Thorne, dimming with their fresher links the dear old
days of long ago.He has not forgotten the love of his youth, never
will; but time has softened the bitterness of his sorrow, and caused
him to think but with a gentle regret of the woman whom God had called
away in the suntime of her youth.But Ruby’s words have come to him
this summer morning awakening old memories long slumbering, and his
thoughts wander from the dear old days, up--up--up to God’s land on
high, where, in the fair summer morning of Paradise, one is waiting
longingly, hopefully--one who, even up in heaven, will be bitterly
disappointed if those who in the old days she loved more than life
itself will not one day join her there.“Dad,” Ruby asks quickly, uplifting a troubled little face to that
other dear one above her, “what is the matter?You looked so sorry, so
very sorry, just now,” adds the little girl, with something almost like
a sob.Did I?” says the father, with a swift sudden smile.He bends
down to the little figure riding by his side, and strokes the soft,
brown hair.“I was thinking of your mother, Ruby,” dad says.“But
instead of looking sorry I should have looked glad, that for her all
tears are for ever past, and that nothing can ever harm her now.I was
thinking of her at heaven’s gate, darling, watching, as she said she
would, for you and for me.”

“I wonder,” says Ruby, with very thoughtful brown eyes, “how will I
know her?God will have to tell her,
won’t He?And p’raps I’ll be quite grown up ’fore I die, and mother
won’t think it’s her own little Ruby at all.I wish I knew,” adds the
child, in a puzzled voice.“God will make it all right, dear.I have no fear of that,” says the
father, quickly.It is not often that Ruby and he talk as they are doing now.Like all
true Scotchmen, he is reticent by nature, reverencing that which is
holy too much to take it lightly upon his lips.As for Ruby, she has
never even thought of such things.In her gay, sunny life she has had
no time to think of the mother awaiting her coming in the land which
to Ruby, in more senses than one, is “very far off.”

Far in the distance the early sunshine gleams on the river, winding out
and in like a silver thread.The tall trees stand stiffly by its banks,
their green leaves faintly rustling in the soft summer wind.And above
all stretches the blue, blue sky, flecked here and there by a fleecy
cloud, beyond which, as the children tell us, lies God’s happiest land.It is a fair scene, and one which Ruby’s eyes have gazed on often,
with but little thought or appreciation of its beauty.But to-day her
thoughts are far away, beyond another river which all must pass, where
the shadows only fall the deeper because of the exceeding brightness
of the light beyond.And still another river rises before the little
girl’s eyes, a river, clear as crystal, the “beautiful, beautiful
river” by whose banks the pilgrimage of even the most weary shall one
day cease, the burden of even the most heavy-laden, one day be laid
down.On what beauties must not her mother’s eyes be now gazing!But
even midst the joy and glory of the heavenly land, how can that fond,
loving heart be quite content if Ruby, one far day, is not to be with
her there?All the way home the little girl is very thoughtful, and a strange
quietness seems to hang over usually merry Ruby for the remainder of
the day.But towards evening a great surprise is in store for her.Dick, whose
duty it is, when his master is otherwise engaged, to ride to the
nearest post-town for the letters, arrives with a parcel in his bag,
addressed in very big letters to “Miss Ruby Thorne.” With fingers
trembling with excitement the child cuts the string.Within is a long
white box, and within the box a doll more beautiful than Ruby has ever
even imagined, a doll with golden curls and closed eyes, who, when
set upright, discloses the bluest of blue orbs.She is dressed in the
daintiest of pale blue silk frocks, and tiny bronze shoes encase her
feet.She is altogether, as Ruby ecstatically exclaims, “a love of a
doll,” and seems but little the worse for her long journey across the
briny ocean.“It’s from Jack!” cries Ruby, her eyes shining.“Oh, and here’s a
letter pinned to dolly’s dress!What a nice writer he is!” The child’s
cheeks flush redly, and her fingers tremble even more as she tears the
envelope open.“I’ll read it first to myself, mamma, and then I’ll give
it to you.”

    “MY DEAR LITTLE RUBY” (so the letter runs),

    “I have very often thought of you since last we parted, and now do
    myself the pleasure of sending madam across the sea in charge of
    my letter to you.She is the little bird I would ask to whisper
    of me to you now and again, and if you remember your old friend
    as well as he will always remember you, I shall ask no more.How
    are the dollies?Bluebell and her other ladyship--I have forgotten
    her name.I often think of you this bleak, cold weather, and envy
    you your Australian sunshine just as, I suppose, you often envy
    me my bonnie Scotland.I am looking forward to the day when you
    are coming home on that visit you spoke of.We must try and have
    a regular jollification then, and Edinburgh, your mother’s home,
    isn’t so far off from Greenock but that you can manage to spend
    some time with us.My mother bids me say that she will expect you
    and your people.Give my kindest regards to your father and mother,
    and, looking forward to next Christmas,

                          “I remain, my dear little Ruby red,
                                                “Your old friend,
                                                             “JACK.”

“Very good of him to take so much trouble on a little girl’s account,”
remarks Mrs.Thorne, approvingly, when she too has perused the letter.It is the least you can do, after his kindness, and I am
sure he would like to have a letter from you.”

“I just love him,” says Ruby, squeezing her doll closer to her.“I wish
I could call the doll after him; but then, ‘Jack’ would never do for
a lady’s name.I know what I’ll do!” with a little dance of delight.“I’ll call her ‘May’ after the little girl who gave Jack the card, and
I’ll call her ‘Kirke’ for her second name, and that’ll be after Jack.I’ll tell him that when I write, and I’d better send him back his card
too.”

That very evening, Ruby sits down to laboriously compose a letter to
her friend.“MY DEAR JACK” (writes Ruby in her large round hand),

[“I don’t know what else to say,” murmurs the little girl, pausing with
her pen uplifted.“I never wrote a letter before.”

“Thank him for the doll, of course,” advises Mrs.Thorne, with an
amused smile.“That is the reason for your writing to him at all, Ruby.”

So Ruby, thus adjured, proceeds--]

    “Thank you very much for the doll.I am calling her ‘May Kirke,’ after the name on your card, and
    after your own name; because I couldn’t call her ‘Jack.’ We are
    having very hot weather yet; but not so hot as when you were here.The dolls are not quite well, because Fanny fell under old Hans’
    waggon, and the waggon went over her face and squashed it.I am
    very sorry, because I liked her, but your doll will make up.Thank
    you for writing me.Mamma says I am to send her kindest regards to
    you.It won’t be long till next Christmas now.I am sending you
    back your card.“With love, from your little friend,
                                                               “RUBY.“P.S.--Dad has come in now, and asks me to remember him to you.I
    have had to write this all over again; mamma said it was so badly
    spelt.”

Jack Kirke’s eyes soften as he reads the badly written little letter,
and it is noticeable that when he reaches a certain point where two
words, “May Kirke,” appear, he stops and kisses the paper on which they
are written.Such are the excessively foolish antics of young men who happen to be
in love.[Illustration]

CHAPTER VIII.“The Christmas bells from hill to hill
  Answer each other in the mist.”

                               TENNYSON.Christmas Day again; but a white, white Christmas this time--a
Christmas Day in bonnie Scotland.In the sitting-room of an old-fashioned house in Edinburgh a little
brown-haired, brown-eyed girl is dancing about in an immense state
of excitement.She is a merry-looking little creature, with rosy
cheeks, and wears a scarlet frock, which sets off those same cheeks to
perfection.“Can’t you be still even for a moment, Ruby?”

“No, I can’t,” the child returns.“And neither could you, Aunt Lena,
if you knew my dear Jack.Oh, he’s just a dear!I wonder what’s keeping
him?What if he’s just gone on straight home to Greenock without
stopping here at all.what if there’s been a collision.Dad says there are quite often collisions in Scotland!” cries Ruby,
suddenly growing very grave.“What if the skies were to fall?Just about as probable, you wild
little Australian,” laughs the lady addressed as Aunt Lena, who bears
sufficient resemblance to the present Mrs.Thorne to proclaim them
to be sisters.“You must expect trains to be late at Christmas time,
Ruby.But of course you can’t be expected to know that, living in the
Australian bush all your days.Poor, dear Dolly, I wonder how she ever
survived it.”

“Mamma was very often ill,” Ruby returns very gravely.“She didn’t
like being out there at all, compared with Scotland.‘Bonnie Scotland’
Jenny always used to call it.But I do think,” adds the child, with
a small sigh and shiver as she glances out at the fast-falling snow,
“that Glengarry’s bonnier.There are so many houses here, and you can’t
see the river unless you go away up above them all.P’raps though in
summer,” with a sudden regret that she has possibly said something
not just quite polite.“And then when grandma and you are always used
to it.It’s different with me; I’ve been always used to Glengarry.Oh,” cries Ruby, with a sudden, glad little cry, and dash to the
front door, “here he is at last!Oh, Jack, Jack!” Aunt Lena can hear
the shrill childish voice exclaiming.“I thought you were just never
coming.I thought p’raps there had been a collision.” And presently
the dining-room door is flung open, and Ruby, now in a high state of
excitement, ushers in her friend.Miss Lena Templeton’s first feeling is one of surprise, almost of
disappointment, as she rises to greet the new-comer.The “Jack” Ruby
had talked of in such ecstatic terms had presented himself before the
lady’s mind’s eye as a tall, broad-shouldered, handsome man, the sort
of man likely to take a child’s fancy; ay, and a woman’s too.But the real Jack is insignificant in the extreme.At such a man one
would not bestow more than a passing glance.So thinks Miss Templeton
as her hand is taken in the young Scotchman’s strong grasp.His face,
now that the becoming bronze of travel has left it, is colourlessly
pale, his merely medium height lessened by his slightly stooping form.It is his eyes which suddenly and irresistibly
fascinate Miss Lena, seeming to look her through and through, and when
Jack smiles, this young lady who has turned more than one kneeling
suitor from her feet with a coldly-spoken “no,” ceases to wonder how
even the child has been fascinated by the wonderful personality of
this plain-faced man.“I am very glad to make your acquaintance, Miss Templeton,” Jack Kirke
says.“It is good of you to receive me for Ruby’s sake.” He glances
down at the child with one of his swift, bright smiles, and squeezes
tighter the little hand which so confidingly clasps his.“I’ve told Aunt Lena all about you, Jack,” Ruby proclaims in her shrill
sweet voice.“She said she was quite anxious to see you after all I had
said.Jack, can’t you stay Christmas with us?It would be lovely if
you could.”

“We shall be very glad if you can make it convenient to stay and eat
your Christmas dinner with us, Mr.Kirke,” Miss Templeton says.“In
such weather as this, you have every excuse for postponing your journey
to Greenock for a little.”

“Many thanks for your kindness, Miss Templeton,” the young man
responds.“I should have been most happy, but that I am due at Greenock
this afternoon at my mother’s.She is foolish enough to set great store
by her unworthy son, and I couldn’t let her have the dismal cheer
of eating her Christmas dinner all alone.Two years ago,” the young
fellow’s voice softens as he speaks, “there were two of us.Nowadays
I must be more to my mother than I ever was, to make up for Wat.He
was my only brother”--all the agony of loss contained in that “was” no
one but Jack Kirke himself will ever know--“and it is little more than
a year now since he died.My poor mother, I don’t know how I had the
heart to leave her alone last Christmas as I did; but I think I was
nearly out of my mind at the time.Anyway I must try to make it up to
her this year, if I possibly can.”

“Was Wat like you?” Ruby asks very softly.She has climbed on her
long-lost friend’s knee, a habit Ruby has not yet grown big enough to
be ashamed of, and sits, gazing up into those other brown eyes.“I wish
I’d known him too,” Ruby says.“A thousand times better,” Wat’s brother returns with decision.“He was
the kindest fellow that ever lived, I think, though it seems queer to
be praising up one’s own brother.If you had known Wat, Ruby, I would
have been nowhere, and glad to be nowhere, alongside of such a fellow
as him.Folks said we were like in a way, to look at; though it was a
poor compliment to Wat to say so; but there the resemblance ended.This
is his photograph,” rummaging his pocket-book--“no, not that one, old
lady,” a trifle hurriedly, as one falls to the ground.“Mayn’t I see it, Jack?” she
petitions.Jack Kirke grows rather red and looks a trifle foolish; but it is
impossible to refuse the child’s request.Had Ruby’s aunt not been
present, it is possible that he might not have minded quite so much.“I like her face,” Ruby determines.“It’s a nice face.”

It is a nice face, this on the photograph, as the child has said.The
face of a girl just stepping into womanhood, fair and sweet, though
perhaps a trifle dreamy, but with that shining in the eyes which tells
how to their owner belongs a gift which but few understand, and which,
for lack of a better name, the world terms “Imagination.” For those
who possess it there will ever be an added glory in the sunset, a
softly-whispered story in each strain of soon-to-be-forgotten music,
a reflection of God’s radiance upon the very meanest things of this
earth.A gift which through all life will make for them all joy
keener, all sorrow bitterer, and which they only who have it can fully
comprehend and understand.“And this is Wat,” goes on Jack, thus effectually silencing the
question which he sees hovering on Ruby’s lips.“I like him, too,” Ruby cries, with shining eyes.“Look, Aunt Lena,
isn’t he nice?Doesn’t he look nice and kind?”

There is just the faintest resemblance to the living brother in the
pictured face upon the card, for in his day Walter Kirke must indeed
have been a handsome man.But about the whole face a tinge of sadness
rests.In the far-away land of heaven God has wiped away all tears for
ever from the eyes of Jack’s brother.In His likeness Walter Kirke has
awakened, and is satisfied for ever.Kirke?” says Ruby’s mother, fluttering into the
room.Thorne is a very different woman from the languid
invalid of the Glengarry days.The excitement and bustle of town life
have done much to bring back her accustomed spirits, and she looks more
like pretty Dolly Templeton of the old days than she has done since
her marriage.We have been out calling on a few
friends, and got detained.Isn’t it a regular Christmas day?I hope
that you will be able to spend some time with us, now that you are
here.”

“I have just been telling Miss Templeton that I have promised to eat
my Christmas dinner in Greenock,” Jack Kirke returns, with a smile.“Business took me north, or I shouldn’t have been away from home in
such weather as this, and I thought it would be a good plan to break my
journey in Edinburgh, and see how my Australian friends were getting
on.My mother intends writing you herself; but she bids me say that
if you can spare a few days for us in Greenock, we shall be more than
pleased.I rather suspect, Ruby, that she has heard so much of you,
that she is desirous of making your acquaintance on her own account,
and discovering what sort of young lady it is who has taken her son’s
heart so completely by storm.”

“Oh, and, Jack,” cries Ruby, “I’ve got May with me.I thought it would be nice to let her see bonnie Scotland again,
seeing she came from it, just as I did when I was ever so little.Can’t
I bring her to Greenock when I come?Because, seeing she is called
after you, she ought really and truly to come and visit you.Oughtn’t
she?” questions Ruby, looking up into the face of May’s donor with very
wide brown eyes.“Of course,” Jack returns gravely.“It would never do to leave May
behind in Edinburgh.” He lingers over the name almost lovingly; but
Ruby does not notice that then.“Dad,” Ruby cries as her father comes into the room, “do you know what?We’re all to go to Greenock to stay with Jack.Isn’t it lovely?”

“Not very flattering to us that you are in such a hurry to get away
from us, Ruby,” observes Miss Templeton, with a slight smile.“Whatever else you have accomplished, Mr.Kirke, you seem to have
stolen one young lady’s heart at least away.”

“I like him,” murmurs Ruby, stroking Jack’s hair in rather a babyish
way she has.“I wouldn’t like never to go back to Glengarry, because I
like Glengarry; but _I should_ like to stay always in Scotland because
Jack’s here.”

CHAPTER IX.“As the stars for ever and ever.”


“Jack,” Ruby says very soberly, “I want you to do something for me.”

Crowning joy has come at last to Ruby.Kirke’s expected letter,
backed by another from her son, has come, inviting the Thornes to spend
the first week of the New Year with them.And now Ruby’s parents have
departed to pay some flying visits farther north, leaving their little
girl, at Mrs.Kirke’s urgent request, to await their return in Greenock.“For Jack’s sake I should be so glad if you could allow her,” Jack’s
mother had said.“It makes everything so bright to have a child’s
presence in the house, and Jack and I have been sad enough since Walter
died.”

Sad enough!Few but Jack could have told
how sad.“Fire away, little Ruby red,” is Jack’s rejoinder.They are in the smoking-room, Jack stretched in one easy chair, Ruby
curled up in another.Jack has been away in dreamland, following with
his eyes the blue wreaths of smoke floating upwards from his pipe to
the roof; but now he comes back to real life--and Ruby.“This is it,” Ruby explains.“You know the day we went down to
Inverkip, dad and I?Well, we went to see mamma’s grave--my own mamma,
I mean.Dad gave me a shilling before he went away, and I thought
I should like to buy some flowers and put them there.It looked so
lonely, and as if everybody had forgotten all about her being buried
there.And she was my own mamma,” adds the little girl, a world of
pathos in her young voice.“So there’s nobody but me to do it.So,
Jack, would you mind?”

“Taking you?” exclaims the young man.“Of course I will, old lady.It’ll be a jolly little excursion, just you and I together.No, not
exactly jolly,” remembering the intent of their journey, “but very
nice.We’ll go to-morrow, Ruby.Luckily the yard’s having holidays just
now, so I can do as I like.As for the flowers, don’t you bother about
them.I’ll get plenty for you to do as you like with.”

“Oh, you are good!” cries the little girl, rising and throwing her arms
round the young man’s neck.“I wish you weren’t so old, Jack, and I’d
marry you when I grew up.”

“But I’m desperately old,” says Jack, showing all his pretty, even,
white teeth in a smile.“Twenty-six if I’m a day.I shall be quite an
old fogey when you’re a nice young lady, Ruby red.Thank you all the
same for the honour,” says Jack, twirling his moustache and smiling to
himself a little.“But you’ll find some nice young squatter in the days
to come who’ll have two words to say to such an arrangement.”

“I won’t ever like anybody so well as you, anyway,” decides Ruby,
resolutely.In the days to come Jack often laughingly recalls this
asseveration to her.“And I don’t think I’ll ever get married.I
wouldn’t like to leave dad.”

The following day sees a young man and a child passing through the
quaint little village of Inverkip, lying about six miles away from the
busy seaport of Greenock, on their way to the quiet churchyard which
encircles the little parish kirk.As Ruby has said, it looks painfully
lonely this winter afternoon, none the less so that the rain and thaw
have come and swept before them the snow, save where it lies in
discoloured patches here and there about the churchyard wall.“I know it by the tombstone,” observes Ruby, cheerfully, as they close
the gates behind them.“It’s a grey tombstone, and mamma’s name below
a lot of others.This is it, I think,” adds the child, pausing before
a rather desolate-looking grey slab.“Yes, there’s her name at the
foot, ‘Janet Stuart,’ and dad says that was her favourite text that’s
underneath--‘Surely I come quickly.Even so come, Lord Jesus.’
I’ll put down the flowers.I wonder,” says Ruby, looking up into Jack’s
face with a sudden glad wonder on her own, “if mamma can look down from
heaven, and see you and me here, and be glad that somebody’s putting
flowers on her grave at last.”

“She will have other things to be glad about, I think, little Ruby,”
Jack Kirke says very gently.“But she will be glad, I am sure, if she
sees us--and I think she does,” the young man adds reverently--“that
through all those years her little girl has not forgotten her.”

“But I don’t remember her,” says Ruby, looking up with puzzled eyes.“Only dad says that before she died she said that he was to tell me
that she would be waiting for me, and that she had prayed the Lord
Jesus that I might be one of His jewels.I’m not!” cries
Ruby, with a little choke in her voice.“And if I’m not, the Lord Jesus
will never gather me, and I’ll never see my mamma again.Even up in
heaven she might p’raps feel sorry if some day I wasn’t there too.”

“I know,” Jack says quickly.He puts his arm about the little girl’s
shoulders, and his own heart goes out in a great leap to this child who
is wondering, as he himself not so very long ago, in a strange mazed
way, wondered too, if even ’midst heaven’s glories another will “feel
sorry” because those left behind will not one far day join them there.“I felt that too,” the young man goes on quietly.“But it’s all right
now, dear little Ruby red.Everything seemed so dark when Wat died,
and I cried out in my misery that the God who could let such things be
was no God for me.But bit by bit, after a terrible time of doubt, the
mists lifted, and God seemed to let me know that He had done the very
best possible for Wat in taking him away, though I couldn’t understand
just yet why.The one thing left for me to do now was to make quite
sure that one day I should meet Wat again, and I couldn’t rest till
I made sure of that.It’s so simple, Ruby, just to believe in the
dear Lord Jesus, so simple, that when at last I found out about it, I
wondered how I could have doubted so long.I can’t speak about such
things,” the young fellow adds huskily, “but I felt that if you feel
about your mother as I did about Wat, that I must help you.Don’t you
see, dear, just to trust in Christ with all your heart that He is able
to save you, and He _will_.It was only for Wat’s sake that I tried to
love Him first; but now I love Him for His own.”

It has cost Ruby’s friend more than the child knows to make even this
simple confession of his faith.But I think that in heaven’s morning
Jack’s crown will be all the brighter for the words he spoke to a
doubting little girl on a never-to-be-forgotten winter’s day.For it is
said that even those who but give to drink of a cup of cold water for
the dear Christ’s sake shall in no wise lose their reward.“I love you, Jack,” is all Ruby says, with a squeeze of her friend’s
hand.“And if I do see mamma in heaven some day, I’ll tell her how
good you’ve been to me.Jack, won’t it be nice if we’re all there
together, Wat and you, and dad and mamma and me?”

Jack does not answer just for a moment.The young fellow’s heart has
gone out with one of those sudden agonizing rushes of longing to the
brother whom he has loved, ay, and still loves, more than life itself.It _must_ be better for Wat--of that Jack with all his loyal heart
feels sure; but oh, how desolately empty is the world to the brother
Jack left behind!One far day God will let they two meet again;
that too Jack knows; but oh, for one hour of the dear old here and
now!In the golden streets of the new Jerusalem Jack will look into
the sorrowless eyes of one whom God has placed for ever above all
trouble, sorrow, and pain; but the lad’s heart cries out with a fierce
yearning for no glorified spirit with crown-decked brow, but the dear
old Wat with the leal home love shining out of his eyes, and the warm
hand-clasp of brotherly affection.Fairer than all earthly music the
song of the redeemed may ring throughout the courts of heaven; but
sweeter far in those fond ears will sound the well-loved tones which
Jack Kirke has known since he was a child.“Yes, dear,” Jack says, with a swift, sudden smile for the eager little
face uplifted to his, “it _will_ be nice.So we must make sure that we
won’t disappoint them, mustn’t we?”

Another face than Ruby’s uprises before the young man’s eyes as he
speaks, the face of the brother whose going had made all the difference
to Jack’s life; but who, up in heaven, had brought him nearer to God
than he ever could have done on earth.Not a dead face, as Jack had
looked his last upon it, but bright and loving as in the dear old days
when the world seemed made for those two, who dreamed such great things
of the wonderful “may be” to come.But now God has raised Wat higher
than even his airy castles have ever reached--to heaven itself, and
brought Jack, by the agony of loss, very near unto Himself.No, Jack
determines, he must make sure that he will never disappoint Wat.The red sun, like a ball of fire, is setting behind the dark, leafless
tree-tops when at last they turn to go, and everything is very still,
save for the faint ripple of the burn through the long flats of field
as it flows out to meet the sea.Fast clasped in Jack’s is Ruby’s
little hand; but a stronger arm than his is guiding both Jack and
Ruby onward.In the dawning, neither Wat nor Ruby’s mother need fear
disappointment now.“I’m glad I came,” says Ruby in a very quiet little voice as the train
goes whizzing home.“There was nobody to come but me, you see, me and
dad, for dad says that mamma had no relations when he married her.They
were all dead, and she had to be a governess to keep herself.Dad says
that he never saw any one so brave as my own mamma was.”

“See and grow up like her, then, little Ruby,” Jack says with one of
his bright, kindly smiles.“It’s the best sight in the world to see a
brave woman; at least _I_ think so,” adds the young man, smiling down
into the big brown eyes looking up into his.He can hardly help marvelling, even to himself, at the situation in
which he now finds himself.How Wat would have laughed in the old
days at the idea of Jack ever troubling himself with a child, Jack,
who had been best known, if not exactly as a child-hater, at least as
a child-avoider.Is it Wat’s mantle
dropped from the skies, the memory of that elder brother’s kindly
heart, which has softened the younger’s, and made him “kind,” as Ruby
one long gone day had tried to be, to all whom he comes in contact
with?For Wat’s sake Jack had first tried to do right; ay, but now it
is for a greater than that dear brother’s, even for Christ’s.Valiant-for-Truth of old renown, Wat has left as sword the legacy of
his great and beautiful charity to the young brother who is to succeed
him in the pilgrimage.“Jack,” Ruby whispers that evening as she kisses her friend good night,
“I’m going to try--you know.I don’t want to disappoint mamma.”

Up in heaven I wonder if the angels were glad that night.There is an old, old verse ringing in my ears, none the
less true that he who spoke it in the far away days has long since gone
home to God: “And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of
the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars
for ever and ever.”

Surely, in the dawning of that “summer morn” Jack’s crown will not be a
starless one.[Illustration]

CHAPTER X.

MAY.“For God above
    Is great to grant, as mighty to make,
  And creates the love to reward the love:
    I claim you still for my own love’s sake!”

                                     BROWNING.Ruby comes into the drawing-room one afternoon to find the facsimile of
the photograph in Jack’s pocket-book sitting with Mrs.“This is our little Australian, May,” the elder lady says, stretching
out her hand to Ruby.“Ruby, darling, this is Miss Leslie.Perhaps Jack
may have told you about her.”

“How do you do, dear?” Miss May Leslie asks.She has a sweet, clear
voice, and just now does not look half so dreamy as in her photograph,
Ruby thinks.Her dark green frock and black velvet hat with ostrich
tips set off her fair hair and delicately tinted face to perfection,
and her blue eyes are shining as she holds out her hand to the little
girl.“I’ve seen your photograph,” Ruby announces, looking up into the sweet
face above her.“It fell out of Jack’s pocket-book one day.He has it
there with Wat’s.I’m going to give him mine to carry there too; for
Jack says he only keeps the people he likes best in it.”

Miss Leslie grows suddenly, and to Ruby it seems unaccountably, as red
as her own red frock.But for all that the little girl cannot help
thinking that she does not look altogether ill-pleased.Kirke
smiles in rather an embarrassed way.“Have you been long in Scotland, Ruby?” the young lady questions, as
though desirous of changing the subject.“We came about the beginning of December,” Ruby returns.And then she
too puts rather an irrelevant question: “Are you May?”

“Well, yes, I suppose I am May,” Miss Leslie answers, laughing in spite
of herself.“But how did you know my name, Ruby?”

“Jack told her, I suppose.Was that it, Ruby?” says Jack’s mother.“And
this is a child, May, who, when she is told a thing, never forgets it.Isn’t that so, little girlie?”

“No, but Jack didn’t tell me,” Ruby answers, lifting wide eyes to her
hostess.“I just guessed that you must be May whenever I came in, and
then I heard auntie call you it.” For at Mrs.Kirke’s own request,
the little girl has conferred upon her this familiar title.“I’ve got
a dolly called after you,” goes on the child with sweet candour.“May
Kirke’s her name, and Jack says it’s the prettiest name he ever heard,
‘May Kirke,’ I mean.For you see the dolly came from Jack, and when I
could only call her half after him, I called her the other half after
you.”

“But, my dear little girl, how did you know my name?” May asks in some
amazement.Her eyes are sparkling as she puts the question.No one
could accuse May Leslie of being dreamy now.“It was on the card,” Ruby announces, triumphantly.Well is it for Jack
that he is not at hand to hear all these disclosures.“Jack left it
behind him at Glengarry when he stayed a night with us, and your name
was on it.Then I knew some other little girl must have given it to
Jack.I didn’t know then that she would be big and grown-up like you.”

“Ruby!I am afraid that you are a sad little tell-tale,” Mrs.It is rather a sore point with her that this pink-and-white
girl should have slighted her only son so far as to refuse his hand
and heart.Poor Jack, he had had more sorrows to bear than Walter’s
death when he left the land of his birth at that sad time.In the fond
mother’s eyes May is not half good enough for her darling son; but
May’s offence is none the more to be condoned on that account.“I must really be going, Mrs.Kirke,” the young lady says, rising.She
cannot bear that any more of Ruby’s revelations, however welcome to
her own ears, shall be made in the presence of Jack’s mother.“I have
inflicted quite a visitation upon you as it is.You will come and see
me, darling, won’t you?” this to Ruby.Kirke if she will be
so kind as to bring you some day.”

“And I’ll bring May Kirke too,” Ruby cries.It may have been the
firelight which sends an added redness to the other May’s cheeks, as
Ruby utters the name which Jack has said is “the prettiest he has ever
heard.”

Ruby escorts her new-found friend down to the hall door, issuing from
which Miss Leslie runs full tilt against a young man coming in.“Oh, Jack,” Ruby cries, “you’re just in time!Miss May’s just going
away.I’ve forgotten her other name, so I’m just going to call her Miss
May.”

“May I see you home?” Jack Kirke asks.“It is too dark now for you to
go by yourself.” He looks straight into the eyes of the girl he has
known since she was a child, the girl who has refused his honest love
because she had no love to give in return, and May’s eyes fall beneath
his gaze.“Very well,” she acquiesces meekly.Ruby, looking out after the two as they go down the dark avenue,
pities them for having to go out on such a dismal night.The little
girl does not know that for them it is soon to be illumined with a
light than which there is none brighter save that of heaven, the truest
land of love.It is rather a silent walk home, the conversation made up of the most
common of common-places--Jack trying to steel himself against this
woman, whom, try as he will, he cannot thrust out of his loyal heart;
May tortured by that most sorrowful of all loves, the love which came
too late; than which there is none sadder in this grey old world to-day.“What a nice little girl Ruby is,” says May at length, trying to fill
up a rather pitiful gap in the conversation.“Your mother seems so fond
of her.I am sure she will miss her when she goes.”

“She’s the dearest little girl in the world,” Jack Kirke declares.His
eyes involuntarily meet May’s blue ones, and surely something which was
not there before is shining in their violet depths--“except,” he says,
then stops.“May,” very softly, “will you let me say it?”

May answers nothing; but, though she droops her head, Jack sees her
eyes are shining.They say that silence gives consent, and evidently
in this case it must have done so, or else the young man in question
chooses to translate it in that way.So the stars smile down on an
old, old story, a story as old as the old, old world, and yet new and
fresh as ever to those who for the first time scan its wondrous pages;
a story than which there is none sweeter on this side of time, the
beautiful, glamorous mystery of “love’s young dream.”

“And are you sure,” Jack asks after a time, in the curious manner
common to young lovers, “that you really love me now, May?that I
shan’t wake up to find it all a mistake as it was last time.I’m very
dense at taking it in, sweetheart; but it almost seems yet as though it
was too good to be true.”

“Quite sure,” May says.She looks up into the face of the man beside
whom all others to her are but “as shadows,” unalterable trust in her
blue eyes.“Jack,” very low, “I think I have loved you all my life.”

       *       *       *       *       *

“_I_ said I would marry you, Jack,” Ruby remarks in rather an offended
voice when she hears the news.“But I s’pose you thought I was too
little.”

“That was just it, Ruby red,” Jack tells her, and stifles further
remonstrance by a kiss.PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED
  LONDON AND BECCLES.TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:


  Text in italics is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.We knew that the infantry was hastening to our
assistance, but unless they joined us before sunrise, our cavalry line
would be brushed away, and the rebels would escape after all our hard work
to head them off from Lynchburg.About daybreak I was aroused by loud
hurrahs, and was told that Ord's corps was coming up rapidly, and forming
in rear of our cavalry.Soon after we were in the saddle and moving
towards the Appomattox Court House road, where the firing was growing
lively; but suddenly our direction was changed, and the whole cavalry
corps rode at a gallop to the right of our line, passing between the
position of the rebels and the rapidly forming masses of our infantry, who
greeted us with cheers and shouts of joy as we galloped along their front.At several places we had to "run the gauntlet" of fire from the enemy's
guns posted around the Court House, but this only added to the interest
of the scene, for we felt it to be the last expiring effort of the enemy
to put on a bold front; we knew that we had them this time, and that at
last Lee's proud army of Northern Virginia was at our mercy.While moving
at almost a charging gait we were suddenly brought to a halt by reports of
a surrender.General Sheridan and his staff rode up, and left in hot haste
for the Court House; but just after leaving us, they were fired into by a
party of rebel cavalry, who also opened fire on us, to which we promptly
replied, and soon put them to flight.Our lines were then formed for a
charge on the rebel infantry; but while the bugles were sounding the
charge, an officer with a white flag rode out from the rebel lines, and we
halted.It was fortunate for us that we halted when we did, for had we
charged we would have been swept into eternity, as directly in our front
was a creek, on the other side of which was a rebel brigade, entrenched,
with batteries in position, the guns double shotted with canister.To have
charged this formidable array, mounted, would have resulted in almost
total annihilation.After we had halted, we were informed that
preliminaries were being arranged for the surrender of Lee's whole army.At this news, cheer after cheer rent the air for a few moments, when soon
all became as quiet as if nothing unusual had occurred.I rode forward
between the lines with Custer and Pennington, and met several old friends
among the rebels, who came out to see us.Among them, I remember Lee
(Gimlet), of Virginia, and Cowan, of North Carolina.I saw General Cadmus
Wilcox just across the creek, walking to and fro with his eyes on the
ground, just as was his wont when he was instructor at West Point.I
called to him, but he paid no attention, except to glance at me in a
hostile manner.While we were thus discussing the probable terms of the surrender, General
Lee, in full uniform, accompanied by one of his staff, and General
Babcock, of General Grant's staff, rode from the Court House towards our
lines.As he passed us, we all raised our caps in salute, which he
gracefully returned.Later in the day loud and continuous cheering was heard among the rebels,
which was taken up and echoed by our lines until the air was rent with
cheers, when all as suddenly subsided.The surrender was a fixed fact, and
the rebels were overjoyed at the very liberal terms they had received.Our
men, without arms, approached the rebel lines, and divided their rations
with the half-starved foe, and engaged in quiet, friendly conversation.There was no bluster nor braggadocia,--nothing but quiet contentment that
the rebellion was crushed, and the war ended.In fact, many of the rebels
seemed as much pleased as we were.Now and then one would meet a surly,
dissatisfied look; but, as a general thing, we met smiling faces and hands
eager and ready to grasp our own, especially if they contained anything to
eat or drink.After the surrender, I rode over to the Court House with
Colonel Pennington and others and visited the house in which the surrender
had taken place, in search of some memento of the occasion.We found that
everything had been appropriated before our arrival.Wilmer McLean, in
whose house the surrender took place, informed us that on his farm at
Manassas the first battle of Bull Run was fought.I asked him to write his
name in my diary, for which, much to his surprise.Others did the same, and I was told that he thus received quite a golden
harvest.While all of the regiments of the division shared largely in the glories
of these two days, none excelled the Second New York Cavalry in its record
of great and glorious deeds.Well might its officers and men carry their
heads high, and feel elated with pride as they received the
congratulations and commendations showered on them from all sides.They
felt they had done their duty, and given the "tottering giant" a blow that
laid him prostrate at their feet, never, it is to be hoped, to rise again.Cramping the Arab's
oar along the iron side, he bumped the landing-stage.Safe on deck, he
became in a moment stiff and haughty, greeting a fellow passenger here
and there with a half-military salute.All afternoon he sat or walked
alone, unapproachable, eyeing with a fierce and gloomy stare the
squalid front of wooden houses on the African side, the gray desert
glare of Asia, the pale blue ribbon of the great Canal stretching
southward into the unknown.He composed melancholy German verses in a note-book.He recalled famous
exiles--Camoens, Napoleon, Byron--and essayed to copy something of all
three in his attitude.He cherished the thought that he, clerk at
twenty-one, was now agent at twenty-two, and traveling toward a house
with servants, off there beyond the turn of the Canal, beyond the curve
of the globe.But for all this, Rudolph Hackh felt young, homesick,
timid of the future, and already oppressed with the distance, the age,
the manifold, placid mystery of China.Toward that mystery, meanwhile, the ship began to creep.Behind her,
houses, multi- funnels, scrubby trees, slowly swung to blot out
the glowing Mediterranean and the western hemisphere.Gray desert banks
closed in upon her strictly, slid gently astern, drawing with them to
the vanishing-point the bright lane of traversed water.She gained the
Bitter Lakes; and the red conical buoys, like beads a-stringing, slipped
on and added to the two converging dotted lines.As he mourned sentimentally at
this lengthening tally of their departure, and tried to quote
appropriate farewells, he was deeply touched and pleased by the sadness
of his emotions.The sombre glow of romantic sentiment faded, however, with the sunset.That evening, as the ship glided from ruby coal to ruby coal of the
gares, following at a steady six knots the theatric glare of her
search-light along arsenically green cardboard banks, Rudolph paced the
deck in a mood much simpler and more honest.In vain he tried the
half-baked philosophy of youth.It gave no comfort; and watching the
clear desert stars of two mysterious continents, he fell prey to the
unbounded and unintelligible complexity of man's world.His own career
seemed no more dubious than trivial.Succeeding days only strengthened this mood.The Red Sea passed in a
dream of homesickness, intolerable heat, of a pale blue surface
stretched before aching eyes, and paler strips of pink and gray coast,
faint and distant.Like dreams, too, passed Aden and Colombo; and then,
suddenly, he woke to the most acute interest.He had ignored his mess-mates at their second-class table; but when the
new passengers from Colombo came to dinner, he heard behind him the
swish of stiff skirts, felt some one brush his shoulder, and saw,
sliding into the next revolving chair, the vision of a lady in white."_Mahlzeit_" she murmured dutifully.Rudolph heard her subside with little flouncings, and felt his ears grow
warm and red.Delighted, embarrassed, he at last took sufficient courage
to steal side-glances.The first showed her to be young, fair-haired, and smartly attired in
the plainest and coolest of white; the second, not so young, but very
charming, with a demure downcast look, and a deft control of her spoon
that, to Rudolph's eyes, was splendidly fastidious; at the third, he was
shocked to encounter the last flitting light of a counter-glance, from
large, dark-blue eyes, not devoid of amusement.He was angry,
conscious of those unlucky wing-and-wing ears, vexed at his own
boldness.He generalized from
long inexperience of a subject to which he had given acutely interested
thought: "They always do."Anger did not prevent him, however, from noting that his neighbor
traveled alone, that she must be an Englishwoman, and yet that she
diffused, somehow, an aura of the Far East and of romance.He shot many
a look toward her deck-chair that evening, and when she had gone below,
strategically bought a cigar, sat down in the chair to light it, and by
a carefully shielded match contrived to read the tag that fluttered on
the arm: "B. Forrester, Hongkong."Afterward he remembered that by early daylight he might have read it for
nothing; and so, for economic penance, smoked to the bitter end, finding
the cigar disagreeable but manly.At all events, homesickness had
vanished in a curious impatience for the morrow.Miss Forrester: he
would sit beside Miss Forrester at table.If only they both were
traveling first-class!--then she might be a great lady.To be enamored
of a countess, now--A cigar, after all, was the proper companion of
bold thoughts.At breakfast, recalling her amusement, he remained silent and wooden."You speak English, I'm sure, don't you?"Miss Forrester was saying, in
a pleasant, rather drawling voice.Her eyes were quite serious now, and
indeed friendly."I have less English to amuse myself with the ladies," he answered
wildly.Next moment, however, he regained that painful mastery of the
tongue which had won his promotion as agent, and stammered: "Pardon.I
would mean, I speak so badly as not to entertain her.""Indeed, you speak very nicely," she rejoined, with such a smile as no
woman had ever troubled to bestow on him."That will be so pleasant,
for my German is shocking."Dazed by the compliment, by her manner of taking for granted that future
conversation which had seemed too good to come true, but above all by
her arch, provoking smile, Rudolph sat with his head in a whirl, feeling
that the wide eyes of all the second-cabiners were penetrating the
tumultuous secret of his breast.Again his English deserted, and left
him stammering.But Miss Forrester chatted steadily, appeared to
understand murmurs which he himself found obscure, and so restored his
confidence that before tiffin was over he talked no less gayly, his
honest face alight and glowing.She taught him the names of the strange
fruits before them; but though listening and questioning eagerly, he
could not afterward have told loquat from pumelo, or custard-apple
from papaya.Nor could this young man, of methodical habits, ever have told how long
their voyage lasted.It passed, unreal and timeless, in a glorious mist,
a delighted fever: the background a blur of glossy white bulkheads and
iron rails, awnings that fluttered in the warm, languorous winds, an
infinite tropic ocean poignantly blue; the foreground, Miss Forrester.Her white figure, trim and dashing; her round blue eyes, filled with coy
wonder, the arch innocence of a spoiled child; her pale, smooth cheeks,
rather plump, but coming oddly and enticingly to a point at the mouth
and tilted chin; her lips, somewhat too full, too red, but quick and
whimsical: he saw these all, and these only, in a bright focus,
listening meanwhile to a voice by turns languid and lively, with now and
then a curious liquid softness, perhaps insincere, yet dangerously
pleasant.Questioning, hinting, she played at motherly age and wisdom.As for him, he never before knew how well he could talk, or how
engrossing his sober life, both in his native village on the Baltic and
afterward in Bremen, could prove to either himself or a stranger.Yet he was not such a fool, he reflected, as to tell everything.So far
from trading confidences, she had told him only that she was bound
straight on to Hongkong; that curiosity alone had led her to travel
second-class, "for the delightful change, you know, from all such
formality"; and that she was "really more French than English."Her
reticence had the charm of an incognito; and taking this leaf from her
book, he gave himself out as a large, vaguely important person
journeying on a large, vague errand.she had said, as they sat together at tea.he ventured, wary and alarmed, wondering whether he could
claim this unknown term as in character with his part."I mean," Miss Forrester explained, smiling, "it is your first visit to
the Far East?""Oh, yes," he replied eagerly, blushing.He would have given worlds to
say, "No.""Griffins are such nice little monsters," she purred.Sometimes at night, waked by the snores of a fat Prussian in the upper
berth, he lay staring into the dark, while the ship throbbed in unison
with his excited thoughts.He
would never see her again; he was hurrying toward lonely and uncertain
shores; yet this brief voyage outvalued the rest of his life.In time, they had left Penang,--another unheeded background for her
arch, innocent, appealing face,--and forged down the Strait of Malacca
in a flood of nebulous moonlight.It was the last night out from
Singapore.That veiled brightness, as they leaned on the rail, showed
her brown hair fluttering dimly, her face pale, half real, half magical,
her eyes dark and undefined pools of mystery.It was late; they had been
silent for a long time; and Rudolph felt that something beyond the
territory of words remained to be said, and that the one brilliant epoch
of his life now drew madly to a close.the woman asked suddenly, gravely, as
though they had been isolated together in the deep spaces of the
same thought.She waved an eloquent little gesture toward the
azure-lighted gulf.Her tone, subdued and
musical, conveyed in the mere words their full enigma and full meaning.He took her seriously, and ransacked all his store of
second-hand philosophy for a worthy answer,--a musty store, dead and
pedantic, after the thrilling spirit of her words."Why, I think--it
is--is it not all now the sense-manifest substance of our duty?'_Das versinnlichte Material unserer Pflicht_' No?"She laughed again (but this time it was like the splash of water in a
deep well), and turned toward him that curiously tilted point of chin
and mouth, her eyes shadowy and mocking.She looked young again,--the
spirit of youth, of knowledge, of wonderful brightness and unbelief."Must we take it so very, very hard?""Isn't it just a place
to be happy in?"As through a tumult he heard, and recognized the wisdom of the ages."Because," she added, "it lasts such a little while--"

On the rail their hands suddenly touched.He was aware of nothing but
the nearness and pallor of her face, the darkness of her eyes shining up
at him.All his life seemed to have rushed concentrating into that one
instant of extreme trouble, happiness, trembling fascination.Footsteps sounded on the deck behind them; an unwelcome voice called
jocosely:--

"Good efening!"The ship's doctor advanced with a roguish, paternal air."You see at the phosphor, not?"Even as she whipped about toward the light, Rudolph had seen, with a
touch of wonder, how her face changed from a bitter frown to the most
friendly smile.The frown returned, became almost savage, when the fat
physician continued:--

"To see the phosphor is too much moon, Mrs.Had the steamer crashed upon a reef, he would hardly have noticed such a
minor shipwreck.why, then--When the doctor, after
ponderous pleasantries, had waddled away aft, Rudolph turned upon her a
face of tragedy.she asked, with baby eyes of wonder, which no longer
deceived, but angered."The tittle--the title
he gave you.""Don't be foolish," she cut in.From beneath her skirt the toe of a
small white shoe tapped the deck angrily.Of a sudden she laughed, and
raised a tantalizing face, merry, candid, and inscrutable."Why, you
never asked me, and--and of course I thought you were saying it all
along.You have such a dear, funny way of pronouncing, you know."He hesitated, almost believing; then, with a desperate gesture, wheeled
and marched resolutely aft.That night it was no Prussian snores which
kept him awake and wretched."Everything is finished," he thought
abysmally.He lay overthrown, aching, crushed, as though pinned under
the fallen walls of his youth.At breakfast-time, the ship lay still beside a quay where mad crowds of
brown and yellow men, scarfed, swathed, and turbaned in riotous colors,
worked quarreling with harsh cries, in unspeakable interweaving uproar.The air, hot and steamy, smelled of strange earth.As Rudolph followed a
Malay porter toward the gang-plank, he was painfully aware that Mrs.Forrester had turned from the rail and stood waiting in his path.The injured wonder in her
eyes he thought a little overdone.He could not halt, but, raising his cap stiffly, managed to
add, "A pleasant voyage," and passed on, feeling as though she had
murdered something.He found himself jogging in a rickshaw, while equatorial rain beat like
down-pouring bullets on the tarpaulin hood, and sluiced the Chinaman's
oily yellow back.Over the heavy-muscled shoulders he caught glimpses of
sullen green foliage, ponderous and drooping; of half-naked barbarians
that squatted in the shallow caverns of shops; innumerable faces, black,
yellow, white, and brown, whirling past, beneath other tarpaulin hoods,
or at carriage windows, or shielded by enormous dripping wicker hats, or
bared to the pelting rain.Curious odors greeted him, as of sour
vegetables and of unknown rank substances burning.He stared like a
visionary at the streaming multitude of alien shapes.The coolie swerved, stopped, tilted his shafts to the ground.Rudolph
entered a sombre, mouldy office, where the darkness rang with tiny
silver bells.Pig-tailed men in skull-caps, their faces calm as polished
ivory, were counting dollars endlessly over flying finger-tips.One of
these men paused long enough to give him a sealed dispatch,--the message
to which the ocean-bed, the Midgard ooze, had thrilled beneath his
tardy keel."Zimmerman recalled," the interpretation ran; "take his station; proceed
at once."He knew the port only as forlorn and insignificant.One consolation remained: he would never see her again.CHAPTER II


THE PIED PIPER

A gray smudge trailing northward showed where the Fa-Hien--Scottish
Oriental, sixteen hundred tons--was disappearing from the pale expanse
of ocean.The sampan drifted landward imperceptibly, seeming, with
nut-brown sail unstirred, to remain where the impatient steamer had met
it, dropped a solitary passenger overside, and cast him loose upon the
breadth of the antipodes.Rare and far, the sails of junks patched the
horizon with umber polygons.Rudolph, sitting among his boxes in the
sampan, viewed by turns this desolate void astern and the more desolate
sweep of coast ahead.His matting sail divided the shining bronze
outpour of an invisible river, divided a low brown shore beyond, and
above these, the strips of some higher desert country that shone like
snowdrifts, or like sifted ashes from which the hills rose black and
charred.Their savage, winter-blasted look, in the clear light of an
almost vernal morning, made the land seem fabulous.Yet here in reality,
thought Rudolph, as he floated toward that hoary kingdom,--here at last,
facing a lonely sea, reared the lifeless, inhospitable shore, the
sullen margin of China.The slow creaking of the spliced oar, swung in its lashing by a
half-naked yellow man, his incomprehensible chatter with some fellow
boatman hidden in the bows, were sounds lost in a drowsy silence,
rhythms lost in a wide inertia.Rudolph
nodded, slept, and waking, found the afternoon sped, the hills gone, and
his clumsy, time-worn craft stealing close under a muddy bank topped
with brown weeds and grass.They had left behind the silted roadstead,
and now, gliding on a gentle flood, entered the river-mouth.Here and
there, against the saffron tide, or under banks quaggy as melting
chocolate, stooped a naked fisherman, who--swarthy as his background but
for a loin-band of yellow flesh--shone wet and glistening while he
stirred a dip-net through the liquid mud.Faint in the distance harsh
cries sounded now and then, and the soft popping of small-arms,--tiny
revolts in the reign of a stillness aged and formidable.Crumbling walls
and squat ruins, black and green-patched with mould--old towers of
defense against pirates--guarded from either bank the turns of the
river.In one reach, a "war-junk," her sails furled, lay at anchor, the
red and white eyes staring fish-like from her black prow: a silly
monster, the painted tompions of her wooden cannon aiming drunkenly
askew, her crew's wash fluttering peacefully in a line of blue dungaree.Beyond the next turn, a fowling-piece cracked sharply, close at hand;
something splashed, and the ruffled body of a snipe bobbed in the bronze
flood alongside."The beggar was too--Hallo!Pick us up, there's a good chap!The bird
first, will you, and then me."A tall young man in brown holland and a battered _terai_ stood above on
the grassy brink."Took you for old Gilly, you know."He
snapped the empty shells from his gun, and blew into the breech, before
adding, "Would _you_ mind, then?That is, if you're bound up for
Stink-Chau.It's a beastly long tramp, and I've been shooting all
afternoon."Followed by three coolies who popped out of the grass with game-bags,
the young stranger descended, hopped nimbly from tussock to gunwale, and
perched there to wash his boots in the river."Might have known you weren't old Gilly," he said over his shoulder."Wutzler said the Fa-Hien lay off signaling for sampan before breakfast."I am agent," answered Rudolph, with a touch of pride, "for Fliegelman
and Sons."He swung his legs inboard, faced
about, and studied Rudolph with embarrassing frankness.He was a
long-limbed young Englishman, whose cynical gray eyes, and thin face
tinged rather sallow and Oriental, bespoke a reckless good humor.Then your name's--what is it again?--Hackh, isn't it?He's off already, and
good riddance.He _was_ a bounder!--Charming spot you've come to!I
daresay if your Fliegelmans opened a hong in hell, you might possibly
get a worse station."Without change of manner, he uttered a few gabbling, barbaric words.A
coolie knelt, and with a rag began to clean the boots, which, from the
expression of young Mr.Heywood's face, were more interesting than the
arrival of a new manager from Germany."It will be dark before we're in," he said."My place for the night, of
course, and let your predecessor's leavings stand over till daylight.Better like it, though, for you'll eat nothing else, term of
your life.""You are very kind," began Rudolph; but this bewildering off-hand
youngster cut him short, with a laugh:--

"No fear, you'll pay me!Much good
that ever did us, with old Zimmerman."The sampan now slipped rapidly on the full flood, up a narrow channel
that the setting of the sun had turned, as at a blow, from copper to
indigo.The shores passed, more and more obscure against a fading light.A star or two already shone faint in the lower spaces.A second war-junk
loomed above them, with a ruddy fire in the stern lighting a glimpse of
squat forms and yellow goblin faces."It is very curious," said Rudolph, trying polite conversation, "how
they paint so the eyes on their jonks.""No eyes, no can see; no can see, no can walkee," chanted Heywood in
careless formula."I say," he complained suddenly, "you're not going to
'study the people,' and all that rot?We're already fed up with
missionaries.Their cant, I mean; no allusion to cannibalism."After the blinding flare of the match, night
seemed to have fallen instantaneously.As their boat crept on to the
slow creaking sweep, both maintained silence, Rudolph rebuked and
lonely, Heywood supine beneath a comfortable winking spark."What I mean is," drawled the hunter, "we need all the good fellows we
can get.Oh, I forgot, you're a German, too.--A
sweet little colony!Gilly's the only gentleman in the whole half-dozen
of us, and Heaven knows he's not up to much.--Ah, we're in.On our
right, fellow sufferers, we see the blooming Village of Stinks."Beyond his shadow a few feeble lights burned
low and scattered along the bank.Strange cries arose, the bumping of
sampans, the mournful caterwauling of a stringed instrument."The native town's a bit above," he continued."We herd together here on
the edge.Their sampan grounded softly in malodorous ooze.Each mounting the bare
shoulders of a coolie, the two Europeans rode precariously to shore."My boys will fetch your boxes," called Heywood.The path, sometimes marshy, sometimes hard-packed clay or stone flags
deeply littered, led them a winding course in the night.Now and then
shapes met them and pattered past in single file, furtive and sinister.At last, where a wall loomed white, Heywood stopped, and, kicking at a
wooden gate, gave a sing-song cry.With rattling weights, the door
swung open, and closed behind them heavily.A kind of empty garden, a
bare little inclosure, shone dimly in the light that streamed from a
low, thick-set veranda at the farther end.Dogs flew at them, barking
outrageously."Be quiet, Flounce,
you fool!"On the stone floor of the house, they leaped upon him, two red chows and
a fox-terrier bitch, knocking each other over in their joy."Olo she-dog he catchee plenty lats," piped a little Chinaman, who
shuffled out from a side-room where lamplight showed an office desk."My compradore, Ah Pat," said Heywood to Rudolph."Ah Pat, my friend he
b'long number one Flickleman, boss man."The withered little creature bobbed in his blue robe, grinning at the
introduction."You welly high-tone man," he murmured amiably."Catchee goo' plice.""All the same, I don't half like it," was Heywood's comment later.He
had led his guest upstairs into a bare white-washed room, furnished in
wicker.Open windows admitted the damp sea breeze and a smell, like foul
gun-barrels, from the river marshes."Where should all the rats be
coming from?"He frowned, meditating on what Rudolph thought a trifle.Above the sallow brown face, his chestnut hair shone oddly,
close-cropped and vigorous."Maskee, can't be helped.--O Boy, one
sherry-bitters, one bamboo!""To our better acquaintance," said Rudolph, as they raised their
glasses.Oh, yes, thanks," the other laughed."Any one would know you for
a griffin here, Mr.When they had sat down to dinner in another white-washed room, and had
undertaken the promised rice and chicken, he laughed again,
somewhat bitterly.You'll be so well acquainted with us all
that you'll wish you never clapped eyes on us."He drained his whiskey
and soda, signaled for more, and added: "Were you ever cooped up,
yachting, with a chap you detested?That's the feeling you come to
have.--Here, stand by.Politeness had so far conquered habit, that he felt
uncommonly flushed, genial, and giddy."That," urged Heywood, tapping the bottle, "that's our only amusement.One good thing we can get is the liquor.'Nisi damnose
bibimus,'--forget how it runs: 'Drink hearty, or you'll die without
getting your revenge,'"

"You are then a university's-man?"On the instant his face had fallen as
impassive as that of the Chinese boy who stood behind his chair,
straight, rigid, like a waxen image of Gravity in a blue gown.--"Yes, of
sorts.--He rose with a laugh and an
impatient gesture.--"Come on.Might as well take in the club as to sit
here talking rot."Outside the gate of the compound, coolies crouching round a lantern
sprang upright and whipped a pair of sedan-chairs into position.Heywood, his feet elevated comfortably over the poles, swung in the
lead; Rudolph followed, bobbing in the springy rhythm of the long
bamboos.The lanterns danced before them down an open road, past a few
blank walls and dark buildings, and soon halted before a whitened front,
where light gleamed from the upper story.As they stumbled up the steep flight, Rudolph heard the click of
billiard balls.A pair of hanging lamps lighted the room into which he
rose,--a low, gloomy loft, devoid of comfort.At the nearer table, a
weazened little man bent eagerly over a pictorial paper; at the farther,
chalking their cues, stood two players, one a sturdy Englishman with a
gray moustache, the other a lithe, graceful person, whose blue coat,
smart as an officer's, and swarthy but handsome face made him at a
glance the most striking figure in the room.A little Chinese imp in
white, who acted as marker, turned on the new-comers a face of
preternatural cunning.The weazened reader rose in a nervous
flutter, underwent his introduction to Rudolph with as much bashful
agony as a school-girl, mumbled a few words in German, and instantly
took refuge in his tattered _Graphic_.The players, however, advanced in
a more friendly fashion.The Englishman, whose name Rudolph did not
catch, shook his hand heartily.Something in his voice, the tired look in his frank blue eyes and
serious face, at once engaged respect."For our sakes," he continued,
"we're glad to see you here.I am sure Doctor Chantel will agree
with me.""Ah, indeed," said the man in military blue, with a courtier's bow."Let's all have a drink," cried Heywood.Despite his many glasses at
dinner, he spoke with the alacrity of a new idea."O Boy, whiskey
_Ho-lan suey, fai di_!"Away bounded the boy marker like a tennis-ball."Hello, Wutzler's off already!"--The little old reader had quietly
disappeared, leaving them a vacant table.--"Isn't he weird?"laughed
Heywood, as they sat down."It is his Chinese wife," declared Chantel, preening his moustache."He
is always ashame to meet the new persons.""I know--feels himself an outcast and all
that.--The Chinese page, quick,
solemn, and noiseless, glided round the table with his tray.--"Ah, you
young devil!See those bead eyes
watching us, eh?A Gilpin Homer, you are, and some fine day we'll see
you go off in a flash of fire.If you don't poison us all first.--Well,
here's fortune!"As they set down their glasses, a strange cry sounded from below,--a
stifled call, inarticulate, but in such a key of distress that all four
faced about, and listened intently."Kom down," called a hesitating voice, "kom down and look-see."They sprang to the stairs, and clattered downward.Dim radiance flooded
the landing, from the street door.Outside, a smoky lantern on the
ground revealed the lower levels.In the wide sector of light stood Wutzler, shrinking and apologetic,
like a man caught in a fault, his wrinkled face eloquent of fear, his
gesture eloquent of excuse.Round him, as round a conjurer, scores of
little shadowy things moved in a huddling dance, fitfully hopping like
sparrows over spilt grain.Where the light fell brightest these became
plainer, their eyes shone in jeweled points of color."By Jove, Gilly, they are rats!"said Heywood, in a voice curiously
forced and matter-of-fact."Flounce killed several this afternoon,
so my--"

No one heeded him; all stared.The rats, like beings of incantation,
stole about with an absence of fear, a disregard of man's presence, that
was odious and alarming.The elder Englishman spoke as though afraid of disturbing
some one."No," he answered in the same tone.The rats, in all their weaving confusion, displayed one common impulse.They sprang upward continually, with short, agonized leaps, like
drowning creatures struggling to keep afloat above some invisible flood.The action, repeated multitudinously into the obscure background,
exaggerated in the foreground by magnified shadows tossing and falling
on the white walls, suggested the influence of some evil stratum, some
vapor subtle and diabolic, crawling poisonously along the ground.Wutzler stood abject, a
magician impotent against his swarm of familiars.Gradually the rats,
silent and leaping, passed away into the darkness, as though they heard
the summons of a Pied Piper.Heywood still used that curious
inflection."Then my brother Julien is still alive," retorted Doctor Chantel,
bitterly."The doctor's right, of course," he answered."I wish my wife weren't
coming back.""Dey are a remember," ventured Wutzler, timidly.The others, as though it had been a point of custom, ignored him.All
stared down, musing, at the vacant stones."Then the concert's off to-morrow night," mocked Heywood, with an
unpleasant laugh.Gilly caught him up, prompt and decided."We shall
need all possible amusements; also to meet and plan our campaign.Meantime,--what do you say, Doctor?--chloride of lime in pots?""That, evidently," smiled the handsome man."Yes, and charcoal burnt in
braziers, perhaps, as Pere Fenouil advises.--Satirical and
debonair, he shrugged his shoulders.--"What use, among these thousands
of yellow pigs?""I wish she weren't coming," repeated Gilly.Rudolph, left outside this conference, could bear the uncertainty no
longer."I am a new arrival," he confided to his young host."The plague, old chap," replied Heywood, curtly."These playful little
animals get first notice.You're not the only arrival to-night."CHAPTER III


UNDER FIRE

The desert was sometimes Gobi, sometimes Sahara, but always an infinite
stretch of sand that floated up and up in a stifling layer, like the
tide.Rudolph, desperately choked, continued leaping upward against an
insufferable power of gravity, or straining to run against the force of
paralysis.The desert rang with phantom voices,--Chinese voices that
mocked him, chanting of pestilence, intoning abhorrently in French.He woke to find a knot of bed-clothes smothering him.To his first
unspeakable relief succeeded the astonishment of hearing the voices
continue in shrill chorus, the tones Chinese, the words, in louder
fragments, unmistakably French.They sounded close at hand, discordant
matins sung by a mob of angry children.Once or twice a weary, fretful
voice scolded feebly: "Un-peu-de-s'lence!Un-peu-de-s'lence!"Rudolph
rose to peep through the heavy jalousies, but saw nothing more than
sullen daylight, a flood of vertical rain, and thin rivulets coursing
down a tiled roof below."Jolivet's kids wake you?"Heywood, in a blue kimono, nodded from the
doorway.Some bally
French theory, you know, sphere of influence, and that rot.Game played
out up here, long ago, but they keep hanging on.--Bath's ready, when you
like.""Did you climb into the water-jar,
yesterday, before dinner?You'll find the dipper
more handy.--How did you ever manage?Rudolph, blushing, prepared
to descend into the gloomy vault of ablution.Charcoal fumes, however,
and the glow of a brazier on the dark floor below, not only revived all
his old terror, but at the stair-head halted him with a new.An inaudible
mutter ended with, "Keep clean, anyway."At breakfast, though the acrid smoke was an enveloping reminder, he made
the only reference to their situation."Rain at last: too late, though, to flush out the gutters.We needed it
a month ago.--I say, Hackh, if you don't mind, you might as well cheer
up.From now on, it's pure heads and tails.Glancing out of window at the murky sky, he added
thoughtfully, "One excellent side to living without hope, maskee
fashion: one isn't specially afraid.I'll take you to your office, and
you can make a start.Dripping bearers and shrouded chairs received them on the lower floor,
carried them out into a chill rain that drummed overhead and splashed
along the compound path in silver points.The sunken flags in the road
formed a narrow aqueduct that wavered down a lane of mire.A few
grotesque wretches, thatched about with bamboo matting, like bottles, or
like rosebushes in winter, trotted past shouldering twin baskets.The
smell of joss-sticks, fish, and sour betel, the subtle sweetness of
opium, grew constantly stronger, blended with exhalations of ancient
refuse, and (as the chairs jogged past the club, past filthy groups
huddling about the well in a marketplace, and onward into the black yawn
of the city gate) assailed the throat like a bad and lasting taste.Now,
in the dusky street, pent narrowly by wet stone walls, night seemed to
fall, while fresh waves of pungent odor overwhelmed and steeped the
senses.Rudolph's chair jostled through hundreds and hundreds of
Chinese, all alike in the darkness, who shuffled along before with
switching queues, or flattened against the wall to stare, almost nose
to nose, at the passing foreigner.With chairpoles backing into one shop
or running ahead into another, with raucous cries from the coolies, he
swung round countless corners, bewildered in a dark, leprous, nightmare
bazaar.Overhead, a slit of cloudy sky showed rarely; for the most part,
he swayed along indoors, beneath a dingy lattice roof.All points of the
compass vanished; all streets remained alike,--the same endless vista of
mystic characters, red, black, and gold, on narrow suspended tablets,
under which flowed the same current of pig-tailed men in blue and dirty
white.From every shop, the same yellow faces stared at him, the same
elfin children caught his eye for a half-second to grin or grimace, the
same shaven foreheads bent over microscopical tasks in the dark.At
first, Rudolph thought the city loud and brawling; but resolving this
impression to the hideous shouts of his coolies parting the crowd, he
detected, below or through their noise, from all the long
cross-corridors a wide and appalling silence.Gradually, too, small
sounds relieved this: the hammering of brass-work, the steady rattle of
a loom, or the sing-song call and mellow bell of some burdened hawker,
bumping past, his swinging baskets filled with a pennyworth of trifles.But still the silence daunted Rudolph in this astounding vision, this
masque of unreal life, of lost daylight, of annihilated direction, of
placid turmoil and multifarious identity, made credible only by the
permanence of nauseous smells.Somewhere in the dark maze, the chairs halted, under a portal black and
heavy as a Gate of Dreams.And as by the anachronism of dreams
there hung, among its tortuous symbols, the small, familiar
placard--"Fliegelman and Sons, Office."Heywood led the way, past two
ducking Chinese clerks, into a sombre room, stone-floored, furnished
stiffly with a row of carved chairs against the wall, lighted coldly by
roof-windows of placuna, and a lamp smoking before some commercial god
in his ebony and tinsel shrine."There," he said, bringing Rudolph to an inner chamber, or dark little
pent-house, where another draughty lamp flickered on a European desk.--Wheeling in
the doorway, he tossed a book, negligently.--"Caught!You may as well
start in, eh?--'Cantonese Made Worse,'"

To his departing steps Rudolph listened as a prisoner, condemned, might
listen to the last of all earthly visitors.Peering through a kind of
butler's window, he saw beyond the shrine his two pallid subordinates,
like mystic automatons, nodding and smoking by the doorway.Beyond
them, across a darker square like a cavern-mouth, flitted the living
phantoms of the street."I am
lost," he thought; lost among goblins, marooned in the age of barbarism,
shut in a labyrinth with a Black Death at once actual and mediaeval: he
dared not think of Home, but flung his arms on the littered desk, and
buried his face.On the tin pent-roof, the rain trampled inexorably.At last, mustering a shaky resolution, he set to work ransacking the
tumbled papers.Happily, Zimmerman had left all in confusion.The very
hopelessness of his accounts proved a relief.Working at high tension,
Rudolph wrestled through disorder, mistakes, falsification; and little
by little, as the sorted piles grew and his pen traveled faster, the old
absorbing love of method and dispatch--the stay, the cordial flagon of
troubled man--gave him strength to forget.At times, felt shoes scuffed the stone floor without, and high, scolding
voices rose, exchanging unfathomable courtesy with his clerks.One after
another, strange figures, plump and portly in their  robes,
crossed his threshold, nodding their buttoned caps, clasping their hands
hidden in voluminous sleeves."My 'long speakee my goo' flien'," chanted each of these apparitions;
and each, after a long, slow discourse that ended more darkly than it
began, retired with fatuous nods and smirks of satisfaction, leaving
Rudolph dismayed by a sense of cryptic negotiation in which he had been
found wanting.Noon brought the only other interval, when two solemn "boys" stole in
with curry and beer.Eat he could not in this lazaret, but sipped a
little of the dark Kirin brew, and plunged again into his researches.Alone with his lamp and rustling papers, he fought through perplexities,
now whispering, now silent, like a student rapt in some midnight fervor.Heywood's voice woke him, sudden
as a gust of sharp air.The summons was both welcome and unwelcome; for as their chairs jostled
homeward through the reeking twilight, Rudolph felt the glow of work
fade like the mockery of wine.The strange seizure returned,--exile,
danger, incomprehensibility, settled down upon him, cold and steady as
the rain.Tea, at Heywood's house, was followed by tobacco, tobacco by
sherry, and this by a dinner from yesterday's game-bag.The two men said
little, sitting dejected, as if by agreement.But when Heywood rose, he
changed into gayety as a man slips on a jacket."Now, then, for the masked ball!I mean, we can't carry these long
faces to the club, can we?He caught up his
cap, with a grimace.On the way, he craned from his chair to shout, in the darkness:--

"I say!If you can do a turn of any sort, let the women have it.Be an ass, like the rest of us.Mind
you, it's all hands, these concerts!"No music, but the click of ivory and murmur of voices came down the
stairway of the club.At first glance, as Rudolph rose above the floor,
the gloomy white loft seemed vacant as ever; at second glance,
embarrassingly full of Europeans.Four strangers grounded their cues
long enough to shake his hand.Nesbit,--Sturgeon--Herr
Kempner--Herr Teppich,"--he bowed stiffly to each, ran the battery of
their inspection, and found himself saluting three other persons at the
end of the room, under a rosy, moon-bellied lantern.A gray matron,
stout, and too tightly dressed for comfort, received him uneasily, a
dark-eyed girl befriended him with a look and a quiet word, while a tall
man, nodding a vigorous mop of silver hair, crushed his hand in a great
bony fist.Earle," Heywood was saying, "Miss Drake, and--how are you,
padre?--Dr."Good-evening," boomed the giant, in a deep and musical bass."We are
very glad, very glad."His voice vibrated through the room, without
effort.It struck one with singular force, like the shrewd, kind
brightness of his eyes, light blue, and oddly benevolent, under brows
hard as granite.Hackh," he ordered genially, "and give
us news of the other world!I mean," he laughed, "west of Suez.Smoking's allowed--here, try that!"He commanded them, as it were, to take their ease,--the women among
cushions on a rattan couch, the men stretched in long chairs.He put
questions, indolent, friendly questions, opening vistas of reply and
recollection; so that Rudolph, answering, felt the first return of
homely comfort.A feeble return, however, and brief: in the pauses of
talk, misgiving swarmed in his mind, like the leaping vermin of last
night.The world into which he had been thrown still appeared
disorderly, incomprehensible, and dangerous.The plague--it still
recurred in his thoughts like a sombre motive; these friendly people
were still strangers; and for a moment now and then their talk, their
smiles, the click of billiards, the cool, commonplace behavior, seemed a
foolhardy unconcern, as of men smoking in a powder magazine."Clearing a bit, outside," called Nesbit.A little, wiry fellow, with
cheerful Cockney speech, he stood chalking his cue at a window."I say,
what's the matter one piecee picnic this week?wheezed the fat Sturgeon, with something like enthusiasm.drawled Rudolph's friend, with an alacrity that seemed half
cynical, half enigmatic.A quick tread mounted the stairs, and into the room rose Dr.He
bowed gracefully to the padre's group, but halted beside the players.Whatever he said, they forgot their game, and circled the table to
listen.He spoke earnestly, his hands fluttering in nervous gestures."Something's up," grumbled Heywood, "when the doctor forgets to pose."Behind Chantel, as he wheeled, heaved the gray bullet-head and sturdy
shoulders of Gilly.He came up with evident weariness, but replied cheerfully:--

"She's very sorry, and sent chin-chins all round.But to-night--Her
journey, you know.She's resting.--I hope we've not delayed
the concert?"Heywood sprang up, flung open a battered piano,
and dragged Chantel to the stool.The elder man blushed, and coughed."Why, really," he stammered.Heywood slid back into his chair, grinning."Proud as an old peacock," he whispered to Rudolph."Peacock's voice,
too."Chantel struck a few jangling chords, and skipping adroitly over
sick notes, ran a flourish.The billiard-players joined the circle, with
absent, serious faces.The singer cleared his throat, took on a
preternatural solemnity, and began.In a dismal, gruff voice, he
proclaimed himself a miner, deep, deep down:--


"And few, I trow, of my being know,
And few that an atom care!"His hearers applauded this gloomy sentiment, till his cheeks flushed
again with honest satisfaction.But in the full sweep of a brilliant
interlude, Chantel suddenly broke down.As he turned on the squealing stool,
they saw his face white and strangely wrought."I had meant," he said,
with painful precision, "to say nothing to-night, and act as--I cannot.He got uncertainly to his feet, hesitating."Ladies, you will not be alarmed."The four players caught his eye, and
nodded.There is no danger here, more than--I
am since disinfected.Monsieur Jolivet, my compatriot--You see, you
understand.For a space, the distant hum of the streets invaded the room.Then
Heywood's book of music slapped the floor like a pistol-shot.Quick as he was, the dark-eyed girl stood blocking his way.They confronted each other, man and woman, as if for a combat of will.The outbreak of voices was cut short; the whole company stood, like
Homeric armies, watching two champions.Chantel, however, broke
the silence.He went to the school sick this
morning.Swollen axillae--the poor fool, not to know!--et
puis--enfin--He is dead."Heywood pitched his cap on the green field of the billiard-cloth.Sudden, hot and cold, like the thrust of a knife, it struck Rudolph that
he had heard the voice of this first victim,--the peevish voice which
cried so weakly for a little silence, at early daylight, that very
morning.A little silence: and he had received the great.A gecko fell from the ceiling, with a tiny thump that made all start.He
had struck the piano, and the strings answered with a faint, aeolian
confusion.Then, as they regarded one another silently, a rustle, a
flurry, sounded on the stairs.A woman stumbled into the loft, sobbing,
crying something inarticulate, as she ran blindly toward them, with
white face and wild eyes.She halted abruptly, swayed as though to fall,
and turned, rather by instinct than by vision, to the other women.protested Gilly, with a helpless stare.Why did you ever let me
come back?The face and the voice came to Rudolph like another trouble across a
dream.This trembling, miserable heap, flung
into the arms of the dark-eyed girl, was Mrs."Go on," said the girl, calmly.She had drawn the woman down beside her
on the rattan couch, and clasping her like a child, nodded toward the
piano."Go on, as if the doctor hadn't--hadn't stopped.""Come, Chantel, chantez!He took the stool in
leap-frog fashion, and struck a droll simultaneous discord."Come on.--
Well, then, catch me on the chorus!""Pour qu' j' finisse
Mon service
Au Tonkin je suis parti!"To a discreet set of verses, he rattled a bravado accompaniment.Presently Chantel moved to his side, and, with the same spirit, swung
into the chorus.The tumbled white figure on the couch clung to her
refuge, her bright hair shining below the girl's quiet, thoughtful face.In his riot of emotions, Rudolph found an over-mastering shame.A
picture returned,--the Strait of Malacca, this woman in the blue
moonlight, a Mistress of Life, rejoicing, alluring,--who was now the
single coward in the room.The question was quick and
revolting.As quickly, a choice of sides was forced on him.He
understood these people, recalled Heywood's saying, and with that, some
story of a regiment which lay waiting in the open, and sang while the
bullets picked and chose.All together: as now these half-dozen men
were roaring cheerfully:--


"Ma Tonkiki, ma Tonkiki, ma Tonkinoise,
Yen a d'autr's qui m' font les doux yeux,
Mais c'est ell' que j'aim' le mieux!"CHAPTER IV


THE SWORD-PEN

"Wutzler was missing last night," said Heywood, lazily.He had finished
breakfast, and lighted a short, fat, glossy pipe.Poor old Wutz, he's getting worse and
worse.Chantel's right, I fancy: it's the native wife."The rest never feel so,--Nesbit, and Sturgeon, and
that lot.But then, they don't fall so low as to marry theirs.""By the way," he sneered, on the landing, "until this scare blows over,
you'd better postpone any such establishment, if you intend--"

"I do not," stammered Rudolph.To his amazement, the other clapped him on the shoulder.The sallow face and cynical gray eyes lighted, for the first
time, with something like enthusiasm.Next moment they had darkened
again, but not before he had said gruffly, "You're not a bad
little chap."Morosely, as if ashamed of this outburst, he led the way through the
bare, sunny compound, and when the gate had closed rattling behind
them, stated their plans concisely and sourly."No work to-day, not a
stroke!We'll just make it a holiday, catchee good time.--What?I won't work, and you can't.We'll go out first and see Captain Kneebone."And when
Rudolph, faithful to certain tradesmen snoring in Bremen, would have
protested mildly, he let fly a stinging retort, and did not regain his
temper until they had passed the outskirts of the village.Yet even the
quarrel seemed part of some better understanding, some new, subtle bond
between two lonely men.Before them opened a broad field dotted with curious white disks, like
bone buttons thrown on a green carpet.Near at hand, coolies trotted and
stooped, laying out more of these circular baskets, filled with tiny
dough-balls.Makers of rice-wine, said Heywood; as he strode along
explaining, he threw off his surly fit.The brilliant sunlight, the
breeze stirring toward them from a background of drooping bamboos, the
gabble of coolies, the faint aroma of the fermenting _no-me_ cakes,
began, after all, to give a truant sense of holiday.Almost gayly, the companions threaded a marshy path to the river, and
bargained with a shrewd, plump woman who squatted in the bow of a
sampan.She chaffered angrily, then laughed at some unknown saying of
Heywood's, and let them come aboard.Summoned by voluble scolding, her
husband appeared, and placidly labored at the creaking sweep.They
slipped down a river of bronze, between the oozy banks; and the
war-junks, the naked fisherman, the green-coated ruins of forts, drifted
past like things in reverie, while the men lay smoking, basking in
bright weather.They looked up into serene spaces, and forgot the umbra
of pestilence.Heywood, now lazy, now animated, exchanged barbaric words with the
boat-woman.As their tones rose and fell, she laughed.Long afterward,
Rudolph was to remember her, a wholesome, capable figure in faded blue,
darting keen glances from her beady eyes, flashing her white teeth in a
smile, or laughing till the green pendants of false jade trembled in
her ears.Wu," said Heywood, between smoke-rings, "and she is a
lady of humor.We are discussing the latest lawsuit, which she describes
as suing a flea and winning the bite.Her maiden name was the Pretty
Lily.She is captain of this sampan, and fears that her husband does not
rate A.Where the river disembogued, the Pretty Lily, cursing and shrilling,
pattering barefoot about her craft, set a matting sail and caught the
breeze.Over the copper surface of the roadstead, the sampan drew out
handily.Ahead, a black, disreputable little steamer lay anchored, her
name--two enormous hieroglyphics painted amidships--staring a bilious
yellow in the morning sun.Under these, at last, the sampan came
bumping, unperceived or neglected.Overhead, a pair of white shoes protruded from the rail in a blue film
of smoke.They twitched, as a dry cackle of laughter broke out.Outboard popped a ruddy little face, set in
the green circle of a _topi_, and contorted with laughter.cried the apparition, as though illustrating
a point.Leaning his white sleeves on the rail, cigar in one fist,
Tauchnitz volume in the other, he roared down over the side a passage of
prose, from which his visitors caught only the words "Ginger Dick" and
"Peter Russet," before mirth strangled him."God bless a man," he cried, choking, "that can make a lonesome old
beggar laugh, out here!How he ever thinks up--But he's took
to writing plays, they tell me."Fat lot
o' good they are, for skippers, and planters, and gory exiles!Be-george, I'll write him a chit!Plays be damned; we
want more stories!"Red and savage, he hurled the book fluttering into the sea, then swore
in consternation.My
intention was, ye know, to fling the bloomin' cigar!"Heywood, laughing, rescued the volume on a long bamboo."Just came out on the look-see, captain," he called up."That hole's no worse
with plague than't is without.Got two cases on board, myself--coolies.Stowed 'em topside, under the boats.--Come up here, ye castaway!Come
up, ye goatskin Robinson Crusoe, and get a white man's chow!"He received them on deck,--a red, peppery little officer, whose shaven
cheeks and close gray hair gave him the look of a parson gone wrong, a
hedge-priest run away to sea.Two tall Chinese boys scurried about with
wicker chairs, with trays of bottles, ice, and cheroots, while he barked
his orders, like a fox-terrier commanding a pair of solemn dock-rats.The white men soon lounged beside the wheel-house.Rudolph, wondering if they saw him wince, listened with painful
eagerness.But the captain disposed of that subject very simply.He stared up at the grimy awning."What I'm thinking
is, will that there Dacca babu at Koprah slip me through his blessed
quarantine for twenty-five dollars.Their talk drifted far away from Rudolph, far from China itself, to
touch a hundred ports and islands, Cebu and Sourabaya, Tavoy and
Selangor.They talked of men and women, a death at Zamboanga, a birth at
Chittagong, of obscure heroism or suicide, and fortunes made or lost;
while the two boys, gentle, melancholy, gliding silent in bright blue
robes, spread a white tablecloth, clamped it with shining brass, and
laid the tiffin.Then the talk flowed on, the feast made a tiny clatter
of jollity in the slumbering noon, in the silence of an ocean and a
continent.And when at last the visitors clambered down the iron side,
they went victorious with Spanish wine."Mind ye," shouted Captain Kneebone, from the rail, "that don't half
exhaust the subjeck o' lott'ries!Why, luck"--He shook both fists aloft,
triumphantly, as if they had been full of money.I've a
tip from Calcutta that--Never mind.Bar sells, when that fortch'n comes,
my boy, the half's yours!Sweeping his arm violently, to threaten the coast
of China and the whole range of his vision,--

"You're the one man," he roared, "that makes all this mess--worth a
cowrie!"Heywood laughed, waved his helmet, and when at last he turned, sat
looking downward with a queer smile."What would a chap ever do without 'em?Old
Kneebone there: his was always that--a fortune in a lottery, and then
Home!He waved his helmet again, before stretching out to sleep."Do
you know, I believe--he _would_ take me."The clinkered hills, quivering in the west, sank gradually into the
heated blur above the plains.As gradually, the two men sank
into dreams.Furious, metallic cries from the Pretty Lily woke them, in the blue
twilight.She had moored her sampan alongside a flight of stone steps,
up which, vigorously, with a bamboo, she now prodded her husband.He
contended, snarling, but mounted; and when Heywood's silver fell
jingling into her palm, lighted his lantern and scuffed along, a
churlish guide.At the head of the slimy stairs, Heywood rattled a
ponderous gate in a wall, and shouted.Some one came running, shot
bolts, and swung the door inward.The lantern showed the tawny, grinning
face of a servant, as they passed into a small garden, of dwarf orange
trees pent in by a lofty, whitewashed wall."These grounds are yours, Hackh," said Heywood."Your predecessor's boy;
and there"--pointing to a lonely barrack that loomed white over the
stunted grove--"there's your house.A Portuguese nunnery, it was, built years ago.My boys are helping set
it to rights; but if you don't mind, I'd like you to stay on at my
beastly hut until this--this business takes a turn.He
nodded at the fat little orange trees."We may live to take our chow
under those yet, of an evening.The lantern skipped before them across the garden, through a penitential
courtyard, and under a vaulted way to the main door and the road.With
Rudolph, the obscure garden and echoing house left a sense of magical
ownership, sudden and fleeting, like riches in the Arabian Nights.The
road, leaving on the right a low hill, or convex field, that heaved
against the lower stars, now led the wanderers down a lane of hovels,
among dim squares of smoky lamplight.Wu, their lantern-bearer, had turned back, and they had begun to pass a
few quiet, expectant shops, when a screaming voice, ahead, outraged the
evening stillness.At the first words, Heywood doubled his pace.Here's a lark--or a tragedy."Jostling through a malodorous crowd that blockaded the quarrel, they
gained the threshold of a lighted shop.Against a rank of orderly
shelves, a fat merchant stood at bay, silent, quick-eyed, apprehensive.Before him, like an actor in a mad scene, a sobbing ruffian, naked to
the waist, convulsed with passion, brandished wild fists and ranted with
incredible sounds.When breath failed, he staggered, gasping, and swept
his audience with the glazed, unmeaning stare of drink or lunacy.The
merchant spoke up, timid and deprecating.As though the words were
vitriol, the other started, whirled face to face, and was seized with a
new raving.Something protruded at his waistband, like a rudimentary, Darwinian
stump.To this, all at once, his hand flung back.With a wrench and a
glitter, he flourished a blade above his head.Heywood sprang to
intervene, in the same instant that the disturber of trade swept his arm
down in frenzy.Against his own body, hilt and fist thumped home, with
the sound as of a football lightly punted.He turned, with a freezing
look of surprise, plucked at the haft, made one step calmly and
tentatively toward the door, stumbled, and lay retching and coughing.The fat shop-keeper wailed like a man beside himself.He gabbled,
imploring Heywood."Yes, yes," he repeated
irritably, staring down at the body, but listening to the stream
of words.Murmurs had risen, among the goblin faces blinking in the doorway.Behind them, a sudden voice called out two words which were caught up
and echoed harshly in the street."Never called me that before," he said quickly.He flung back a hurried sentence to the merchant, caught Rudolph's arm,
and plunged into the crowd.The yellow men gave passage mechanically,
but with lowering faces.Once free in the muddy path, he halted quickly,
and looked about."Might have known," he grumbled."Never called me 'Foreign Dog' before,
or 'Jesus man,' He set 'em on."In the dim light, at the outskirts of the
rabble, a man was turning away, with an air of contempt or unconcern.The long, pale, oval face, the hard eyes gleaming with thought, had
vanished at a glance.A tall, slight figure, stooping in his long robe,
he glided into the darkness.For all his haste, the gait was not the
gait of a coolie."That," said Heywood, turning into their former path, "that was Fang,
the Sword-Pen, so-called.Of the two most dangerous
men in the district, he's one."They had swung along briskly for several
minutes, before he added: "The other most dangerous man--you've met him
already.If I'm not mistaken, he's no less a person than the Reverend
James Earle."exclaimed Rudolph, in dull bewilderment.We must find him to-night, and
report."He strode forward, with no more comment.At his side, Rudolph moved as a
soldier, carried onward by pressure and automatic rhythm, moves in the
apathy of a forced march.The day had been so real, so wholesome, full
of careless talk and of sunlight.And now this senseless picture blotted
all else, and remained,--each outline sharper in memory, the smoky lamp
brighter, the blow of the hilt louder, the smell of peanut oil more
pungent.The episode, to him, was a disconnected, unnecessary fragment,
one bloody strand in the whole terrifying snarl.But his companion
stalked on in silence, like a man who saw a pattern in the web of
things, and was not pleased.CHAPTER V


IN TOWN

Night, in that maze of alleys, was but a more sinister day.The same
slant-eyed men, in broken files, went scuffing over filthy stone, like
wanderers lost in a tunnel.The same inexplicable noises endured, the
same smells.Under lamps, the shaven foreheads still bent toward
microscopic labor.The curtained window of a fantan shop still glowed in
orange translucency, and from behind it came the murmur and the endless
chinking of cash, where Fortune, a bedraggled, trade-fallen goddess,
split hairs with coolies for poverty or zero.Nothing was altered in
these teeming galleries, except that turbid daylight had imperceptibly
given place to this other dimness, in which lanterns swung like tethered
fire-balloons.Life went on, mysteriously, without change or sleep.While the two white men shouldered their way along, a strange chorus
broke out, as though from among the crowded carcasses in a butcher's
stall.Shrill voices rose in unearthly discord, but the rhythm was
not of Asia.He halted where, between the
butcher's and a book-shop, the song poured loud through an open doorway.Nodding at a placard, he added: "Here we are: 'Jesus Religion Chapel.''There is a gate that stands ajar.'That being the
case, in you go!"Entering a long, narrow room, lighted from sconces at either side, they
sat down together, like schoolmates, on a low form near the door.From a
dais across at the further end, the vigorous white head of Dr.Earle
dominated the company,--a strange company, of lounging Chinamen who
sucked at enormous bamboo pipes, or squinted aimlessly at the vertical
inscriptions on the walls, or wriggling about, stared at the
late-comers, nudged their neighbors, and pointed, with guttural
exclamations.The song had ended, and the padre was lifting up his
giant's voice.To Rudolph, the words had been mere sound and fury, but
for a compelling honesty that needed no translation.This man was not
preaching to heathen, but talking to men.His eyes had the look of one
who speaks earnestly of matters close at hand, direct, and simple.Along
the forms, another and another man forgot to plait his queue, or squirm,
or suck laboriously at his pipe.When
some waif from the outer labyrinth scuffed in, affable, impudent,
hailing his friends across the room, he made but a ripple of unrest,
and sank gaping among the others like a fish in a pool.Even Heywood sat listening--with more attention than respect, for once
he muttered, "Rot!"Toward the close, however, he leaned across and
whispered, "The old boy reels it off rather well to-night.Rudolph, for his part, sat watching and listening, surprised by a new
and curious thought.A band of huddled converts sang once more, in squealing discords, with
an air of sad, compulsory, and diabolic sarcasm.A few "inquirers"
slouched forward, and surrounding the tall preacher, questioned him
concerning the new faith.The last, a broad, misshapen fellow with
hanging jowls, was answered sharply.He stood arguing, received another
snub, and went out bawling and threatening, with the contorted face and
clumsy flourishes of some fabulous hero on a screen.The missionary approached smiling, but like a man who has finished the
day's work."That fellow--Good-evening: and welcome to our Street Chapel, Mr.Hackh--That fellow," he glanced after the retreating figure, "he's a
lesson in perseverance, gentlemen.A merchant, well-to-do: he has a
lawsuit coming on--notorious--and tries to join us for protection.Cheaper to buy a little belief, you know, than to pay Yamen fines.Every night he turns up, grinning and bland.I tell him it won't do, and
out he goes, snorting like a dragon."Rudolph's impulse came to a head.Earle," he stammered, "I owe you a gratitude.You spoke to these
people so--as--I do not know.But I listened, I felt--Before always are
they devils, images!And after I hear you, they are as men."The other shook his great head like a silver mane, and laughed."My dear young man," he replied, "they're remarkably like you and me."After a pause, he added soberly:--

"Images?His deep voice altered, his eyes lighted shrewdly, as he turned
to Heywood."Quite," said the young man, readily."If you don't mind, padre, you
made Number One talk.In a few brief sentences, he pictured the death in the
shop.--So, like winking!The beggar gave himself the iron, fell down,
and made finish.Now what I pieced out, from his own bukhing, and the
merchant's, was this:--

"The dead man was one Au-yoeng, a cormorant-fisher.Some of his best
birds died, he had a long run of bad luck, and came near starving.So he
contrived, rather cleverly, to steal about a hundred catties of Fuh-kien
hemp.The owner, this merchant, went to the elders of Au-yoeng's
neighborhood, who found and restored the hemp, nearly all.But the neighbors kept after this cormorant fellow,
worked one beastly squeeze or another, ingenious baiting, devilish--Rot!Well, they pushed him
down-hill--poor devil, showing that's always possible, no bottom!He
brooded, and all that, till he thought the merchant and the Jesus
religion were the cause of all.So bang he goes down the
pole,--gloriously drunk,--marches into his enemy's shop, and uses that
knife.The joke is now on the merchant, eh?""Just a moment," begged the padre."One thread I don't follow--the
religion.Thought I told you," said Heywood."One of yours--big,
mild chap--Chok Chung.""Yes," the deep bass rumbled in the empty chapel, "he's one of us."Must be, sir," prompted the younger."The mob, meanwhile, just stood
there, dumb,--mutes and audience, you know.All at once, the hindmost
began squalling 'Foreign Dog,' 'Goat Man.'We stepped outside, and
there, passing, if you like, was that gentle bookworm, Mr.echoed the padre, as in doubt.Why, doctor," cried Heywood, "that long, pale chap,--lives over
toward the Dragon Spring.Confucian, very strict; keen reader; might be
a mandarin, but prefers the country gentleman sort; bally
mischief-maker, he's done more people in the eye than all the Yamen
hacks and all their false witnesses together!Hence his nickname--the
Sword-Pen."Earle sharpened his heavy brows, and studied the floor."Fang, the Sword-Pen," he growled; "yes, there will be trouble.Saul of Tarsus.--We're not the Roman
Church," he added, with his first trace of irritation.Once more he meditated; then heaved his big shoulders to let slip the
whole burden."One day at a time," he laughed."Thank you for telling us.--You see,
Mr.The only fault is, they're just human
beings.They talked of things indifferent; and when the young men were stumbling
along the streets, he called after them a resounding "Good-night!--and stood a resolute, gigantic silhouette, filling, as a right
Doone filled their doorframe, the entrance to his deserted chapel.At his gate, felt Rudolph, they had unloaded some weight of
responsibility.He had not only accepted it, but lightened them further,
girt them, by a word and a look.Somehow, for the first time since
landing, Rudolph perceived that through this difficult, troubled,
ignorant present, a man might burrow toward a future gleam.As for Heywood, he still marched on grimly, threading
the stuffed corridors like a man with a purpose."Catchee bymby, though.To lose sight of any man for twenty-four hours, nowadays,--Well,
it's not hardly fair.They turned down a black lane, carpeted with dry rubbish.At long
intervals, a lantern guttering above a door showed them a hand's-breadth
of the dirty path, a litter of broken withes and basket-weavers' refuse,
between the mouldy wall of the town and a row of huts, no less black and
silent.In this greasy rift the air lay thick, as though smeared into
a groove.Suddenly, among the hovels, they groped along a checkered surface of
brick-work.The flare of Heywood's match revealed a heavy wooden door,
which he hammered with his fist.After a time, a disgruntled voice
within snarled something in the vernacular.Wutzler, you old pirate, open up!"A bar clattered down, the door swung back, and there, raising a
glow-worm lantern of oiled paper, stood such a timorous little figure as
might have ventured out from a masquerade of gnomes.The wrinkled face
was Wutzler's, but his weazened body was lost in the glossy black folds
of a native jacket, and below the patched trousers, his bare ankles and
coolie-sandals of straw moved uneasily, as though trying to hide behind
each other."Kom in," said this hybrid, with a nervous cackle."I thought you are
thiefs.Following through a toy courtyard, among shadow hints of pigmy shrubs
and rockery, they found themselves cramped in a bare, clean cell,
lighted by a European lamp, but smelling of soy and Asiatics.Stiff
black-wood chairs lined the walls.A distorted landscape on rice-paper,
narrow scarlet panels inscribed with black cursive characters, pith
flowers from Amoy, made blots of brightness."It iss not moch, gentlemen," sighed Wutzler, cringing."But I am ver'
glad.""And we came all the way to see
you."Oh, allow me," mumbled their host, in a flutter."My--she--I will
speak, I go bring you."He shuffled away, into some further chamber."Eat it," he whispered, "whether you can or not!Pleases the old one, no
bounds.We're his only visitors--"

"Here iss not moch whiskey."Wutzler came shambling in, held a bottle
against the light, and squinted ruefully at the yellow dregs."I will
gif you a _kong_ full, but I haf not."They heard his angry whispers, and a small
commotion of the household,--brazen dishes clinking, squeals, titters,
and tiny bare feet skipping about,--all the flurry of a rabbit-hutch in
Wonderland.Once, near the threshold, a chubby face, very pale, with
round eyes of shining jet, peered cautious as a mouse, and popped out of
sight with a squeak.Wutzler, red with excitement, came and went like an
anxious waiter, bringing in the feast."Here iss not moch," he repeated sadly.But there were bits of pig-skin
stewed in oil; bean-cakes; steaming buns of wheat-flour, stuffed with
dice of fat pork and lumps of sugar; three-cornered rice puddings,
_no-me_ boiled in plantain-leaf wrappers; with the last of the whiskey,
in green cups.While the two men ate, the shriveled outcast beamed
timidly, hovering about them, fidgeting."Herr Hackh," he suddenly exclaimed, in a queer, strained voice, "you do
not know how dis yong man iss goot!He hass to me--_immer_--" He
choked, turned away, and began fussing with the pith flowers; but not
before Rudolph had seen a line glistening down the sun-dried cheeks.Cadging for chow, does one acquire merit?"retorted Heywood,
over his shoulder."You talk like a bonze, Wutz.""I'd rather
hear the sing-song box.""_Ach so_, I forget!"Still whimpering, Wutzler dragged something from a
corner, squatted, and jerked at a crank, with a noise of ratchets."She
blay not so moch now," he snuffled."Captain Kneepone he has gifen her,
when she iss all op inside for him.I haf rebaired, but she blay only
one song yet.A man does not know, Herr Hackh, what he may be.Once I
haf piano, and viola my own, yes, and now haf I diss small, laffing,
sick teufel!"He rose, and faced Heywood with a trembling, passionate
gesture."But diss yong man, he stand by der oldt fellow!"Behind him, with a whirring sound, a metallic voice assailed them in a
gabble of words, at first husky and broken, then clear, nasal, a voice
from neither Europe nor Asia, but America:--


"Then did I laff?Ooh, aha-ha ha ha,
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!I could not help but laffing,
Ooh, aha-ha..."


From a throat of tin, it mocked them insanely with squealing,
black-hearted guffaws.Heywood sat smoking, with the countenance of a
stoic; but when the laughter in the box was silent, he started abruptly."We're off, old chap," he announced.Just came to see you were
all up-standing.Don't let--er--anything carry
you off."At the gate, Wutzler held aloft his glow-worm lantern.he mumbled, "Der plagues--dey will forget me.All zo many shoots, _kugel_, der bullet,--'_gilt's mir, oder gilt es
dir?_' Men are dead in der Silk-Weafer Street.Dey haf hong up nets, and
dorns, to keep out der plague's-goblins off deir house.Listen, now, dey
beat gongs!--But we are white men.You--you tell me zo, to-night!"He
blubbered something incoherent, but as the gate slammed they heard the
name of God, in a broken benediction.They had groped out of the cleft, and into a main corridor, before
Heywood paused."Queer it
should get into me so.But I hate being laughed at by--anybody."A confused thunder of gongs, the clash of cymbals smothered in the
distance, maintained a throbbing uproar, pierced now and then by savage
yells, prolonged and melancholy.As the two wanderers listened,--

"Where's the comfort," said Heywood, gloomily, "of knowing somebody's
worse off?--No, I wasn't thinking of Wutzler, then.why,
over there, it's goblins they're scaring away.Think, behind their nets
and thorns, what wretches--women, too, and kids--may be crouched down,
quaking, sick with terror.Humph!--I don't mind saying"--for a moment
his hand lay on Rudolph's shoulder--"that I loathe giving this muck-hole
the satisfaction--I'd hate to go Out here, that's all."CHAPTER VI


THE PAGODA

He was spared that inconvenience.The untimely rain and cold, some
persons said, the few days of untimely heat following, had drowned or
dried, frozen or burnt out, the seeds of peril.But accounts varied,
reasons were plentiful.Soldiers had come down from the chow city,
two-score _li_ inland, and charging through the streets, hacking and
slashing the infested air, had driven the goblins over the walls, with a
great shout of victory.A priest had freighted a kite with all the evil,
then cut it adrift in the sky.A mob had dethroned the God of Sickness,
and banished his effigy in a paper junk, launched on the river at night,
in flame.A geomancer proclaimed that a bamboo grove behind the town
formed an angle most correct, germane, and pleasant to the Azure Dragon
and the White Tiger, whose occult currents, male and female, run
throughout Nature.For any or all of these reasons, the town was
delivered.The pestilence vanished, as though it had come but to grant
Monsieur Jolivet his silence, and to add a few score uncounted living
wretches to the dark, mighty, imponderable host of ancestors.The relief, after dragging days of uncertainty, came to Rudolph like a
sea-breeze to a stoker.To escape and survive,--the bare experience
seemed to him at first an act of merit, the deed of a veteran.The
interim had been packed with incongruity.There had been a dinner with
Kempner, solemn, full of patriotism and philosophy; a drunken dinner at
Teppich's; another, and a worse, at Nesbit's; and the banquet of a
native merchant, which began at four o'clock on melon-seeds, tea, black
yearling eggs, and a hot towel, and ended at three in the morning on
rice-brandy and betel served by unreal women with chalked faces and
vermilion-spotted lips, simpering and melancholy.By day, there was
work, or now and then a lesson with Dr.Earle's teacher, a little aged
Chinaman of intricate, refined, and plaintive courtesy.Under his
guidance Rudolph learned rapidly, taking to study as a prodigal might
take to drink.And with increasing knowledge came increasing
tranquillity; as when he found that the hideous cry, startling him at
every dawn, was the signal not for massacre, but buffalo-milk.Then, too, came the mild excitement of moving into his own house, the
Portuguese nunnery.Through its desolate, lime-coated spaces, his meagre
belongings were scattered all too easily; but the new servants, their
words and ways, not only kept his hands full, but gave strange food for
thought.The silent evenings, timed by the plash of a frog in a pool, a
cry from the river, or the sing-song of a "boy" improvising some endless
ballad below-stairs; drowsy noons above the little courtyard, bare and
peaceful as a jail; homesick moments at the window, when beyond the
stunted orangery, at sunset, the river was struck amazingly from bronze
to indigo, or at dawn flashed from pearl-gray to flowing brass;--all
these, and nights between sleep and waking, when fancy peopled the
echoing chambers with the visionary lives, now ended, of meek, brown
sisters from Goa or Macao, gave to Rudolph intimations, vague, profound,
and gravely happy, as of some former existence almost recaptured.Once
more he felt himself a householder in the Arabian tales.And yet, when his life was growing all but placid, across it shot some
tremor of disquieting knowledge.One evening, after a busy day among his piece-goods, he had walked
afield with Heywood, and back by an aimless circuit through the
twilight.His companion had been taciturn, of late; and they halted,
without speaking, where a wide pool gleamed toward a black, fantastic
belt of knotted willows and sharp-curving roofs.Through these broke the
shadow of a small pagoda, jagged as a war-club of shark's teeth.Vesper
cymbals clashed faintly in a temple, and from its open door the first
plummet of lamplight began to fathom the dark margin.A short bridge
curved high, like a camel's hump, over the glimmering half-circle of a
single arch.Close by, under a drooping foreground of branches, a stake
upheld an oblong placard of neat symbols, like a cartouche to explain
a painting."It is very beautiful," ventured Rudolph, twisting up his blond
moustache with satisfaction.I would say--picturesque, no?""Very," said Heywood, absently."And the placard, so finishing, so artistic--That says?"Heywood glanced carelessly at the
upright sentence.That's a notice:--

"'Girls May Not be Drowned in This Pond.'"Without reply, Rudolph followed,
gathering as he walked the force of this tremendous hint.Slow,
far-reaching, it poisoned the elegiac beauty of the scene, alienated the
night, and gave to the fading country-side a yet more ancient look,
sombre and implacable.He was still pondering this, when across their
winding foot-path, with a quick thud of hoofs, swept a pair of
equestrian silhouettes.It was half glimpse, half conjecture,--the tough
little ponies trotting stubbornly, a rider who leaned across laughing,
and a woman who gayly cried at him: "You really do understand me, don't
you?"The two jogging shadows melted in the bamboo tracery, like things
blown down the wind.But for years Rudolph had known the words, the
laugh, the beguiling cadence, and could have told what poise of the head
went with them, what dangerous glancing light.Suddenly, without reason,
he felt a gust of rage.The memory of her weakness was lost in the shining
memory of her power.He should be riding there, in the dusk of this
lonely and cruel land.Heywood had thrown after them a single gloomy stare, down the pointed
aisle of bamboos."Chantel--He bounds in the saddle, and he
bounds afoot!"Rudolph knew that he had hated Chantel at sight.He could not bring himself, next day, to join their party for tiffin at
the Flowery Pagoda.But in the midst of his brooding, Teppich and the
fat Sturgeon assailed the nunnery gate with pot-valiant blows and
shouts.They had brought chairs, to carry him off; and being in no mood
to fail, though panting and struggling, they packed him into a
palanquin with many bottles of the best wine known to Fliegelman and
Sons.By a short cut through the streets--where checkered sunshine,
through the lattice roof, gave a muddy, subdued light as in a roiled
aquarium--the revelers passed the inland wall.Here, in the shade,
grooms awaited them with ponies; and scrambling into saddle, they
trotted off through gaps in the bamboos, across a softly rolling
country.Tortuous foot-paths of vivid pink wound over brilliant green
terraces of young paddy.The pink crescents of new graves scarred the
hillsides, already scalloped and crinkled with shelving abodes of the
venerable dead.Great hats of farmers stooping in the fields, gleamed in
the sun like shields of brass.Over knolls and through hollows the
little cavalcade jogged steadily, till, mounting a gentle eminence, they
wound through a grove of camphor and Flame-of-the-Forest.Above the
branches rose the faded lilac shaft of an ancient pagoda, ruinously
adorned with young trees and wild shrubs clinging in the cornices.At the foot of this aged fantasy in stone, people were laughing.The
three riders broke cover in time to see Mrs.Forrester, flushed and
radiant, end some narrative with a droll pantomime.She stood laughing,
the life and centre of a delighted group."And Gilbert Forrester," she cried, turning archly on her husband,
"said that wasn't funny!"Gilly tugged his gray moustache, in high good-nature.Chantel, Nesbit,
and Kempner laughed uproariously, the padre and the dark-eyed Miss Drake
quietly, Heywood more quietly, while even stout, uneasy Mrs.Earle
smiled as in duty bound.A squad of Chinese boys, busy with
tiffin-baskets, found time to grin.To this lively actress in the white
gown they formed a sylvan audience under the gnarled boughs and
the pagoda.called the white-haired giant, indulgently, to the
dismounting trio.Hackh, you should have come spurring."Rudolph advanced, pale, but with a calmness of which, afterward, he was
justly proud.The heroine of the moment turned toward him quickly, with
a look more natural, more sincere, than she had ever given him."I've heard so much about
you!"Was there a club, from which he had stolen out while she wept,
ignominiously, in that girl's arms?And then of a sudden he perceived,
with a fatuous pleasure, how well she knew him, to know that he had
never spoken.His English, as he drew up a stool beside Miss Drake, was
wild and ragged; but he found her an astonishing refuge.For the first
time, he recalled that this quiet girl had been beautiful, the other
night; and though now by day that beauty was rather of line than of
color, he could not understand how it had been overlooked.Tiffin,
meanwhile, sped by like an orgy.He remembered asking so many questions,
about the mission hospital and her school for orphans, that the girl
began at last to answer with constraint, and with puzzled, sidelong
scrutiny.He remembered how even the tolerant Heywood shot a questioning
glance toward his wine-glass.He remembered telling a brilliant story,
and reciting "Old Captain Mau in Vegesack,"--rhymes long forgotten, now
fluent and spontaneous.Through it, as
through a haze, he saw a pair of wide blue eyes shining with startled
admiration.But the best came when the sun had lowered behind the grove, the company
grown more silent, and Mrs.Forrester, leaning beside the door of the
tower, turned the great pegs of a Chinese lute.The notes tinkled like a
mandolin, but with now and then an alien wail, a lament unknown to the
West."Sing for us," begged the dark-eyed girl; "a native song."The
other smiled, and bending forward as if to recollect, began in a low
voice, somewhat veiled, but musical and full of meaning."The Jasmine
Flower," first; then, "My Love is Gathering Dolichos"; and then she
sang the long Ballad of the Rice,--of the husband and wife planting side
by side, the springing of the green blades, the harvest by millions upon
millions of sheaves, the wealth of the State, more fragrant to ancestors
than offerings of spice:--


"...O Labor and Love and hallowed Land!Think you these things are but still to come?Think you they are but near at hand,
Only now and here?--Behold.In her plaintive interlude, the slant-eyed servants watched her, nodding
and muttering under the camphor trees."And here's a song of exile," she said.--Rudolph had never seen her face like this, bending intently
above the lute.It was as though in the music she found and disclosed
herself, without guile."...Blue was the sky,
And blue the rice-pool water lay
Holding the sky;
Blue was the robe she wore that day.Why
Must life bear all away,
Away, away,
Ah, my beloved, why?"A murmur of praise went round the group, as she put aside the
instrument."The sun's getting low," she said lightly, "and I _must_ see that view
from the top."Chantel was rising, but sat down again with a scowl, as
she turned to Rudolph.Inside, with echoing steps, they mounted in a squalid well, obscurely
lighted from the upper windows, toward which decaying stairs rose in a
dangerous spiral, without guard-rail.A misstep being no trifle, Rudolph
offered his hand for the mere safety; but she took it with a curious
little laugh.Once, at a halt, she stood very
close, with eyes shining large in the dusk.Her slight body trembled,
her head shook with stifled merriment, like a girl overcome by mischief."You and I here!--I never
dreamed you could be funny.It made me so proud of you, down there!"He muttered something vague; and--the stairs ending in ruin at the
fourth story--handed her carefully through the window to a small outer
balustrade.As they stood together at the rail, he knew not whether to
be angry, suspicious, or glad."I love this prospect," she began quietly."That's why I wanted you to
come."Beyond the camphors, a wide, strange landscape glowed in the full,
low-streaming light.The ocean lay a sapphire band in the east; in the
west, on a long ridge, undulated the gray battlements of a city, the
antique walls, warmed and glorified, breasting the flood of sunset.All
between lay vernal fields and hillocks, maidenhair sprays of bamboo, and
a wandering pattern of pink foot-paths.Slowly along one of these, a
bright-gowned merchant rode a white pony, his bells tinkling in the
stillness of sea and land.Everywhere, like other bells more tiny and
shrill, sounded the trilling of frogs.As the two on the pagoda stood listening,--

"It was before Rome," she declared thoughtfully."Before Egypt, and has
never changed.You and I are just--" She broke off, humming:--


"Only here and now?Behold
They were the same in years of old!"Her mood  the scene: the aged continuity of life oppressed him.Yet he chose rather to watch the straggling battlements, far off, than
to meet her eyes or see her hair gleaming in the sun.Through many
troubled days he had forgotten her, despised her, bound his heart in
triple brass against a future in her hateful neighborhood; and now,
beside her at this time-worn rail, he was in danger of being happy.Suddenly, with an impulse that must have been generous,
she rested her hand on his arm.At these close quarters, her tremulous voice and searching upward glance
meant that she alone understood all his troubles.He started, turned for
some rush of overwhelming speech, when a head popped through the window
behind them.His lean young
face was very droll and knowing."Thank you so much, Maurice," she answered, perhaps dryly."You're a
dear, to climb all those dreadful stairs."said Heywood, with his gray eyes fastened on Rudolph, "no
trouble."When the company were mounted, and trooping downhill through the camphor
shadow, Heywood's pony came sidling against Rudolph's, till legging
chafed legging."You blossomed, old boy," he whispered."Quite the star, after your
comedy turn.""What price sympathy on
a pagoda?"For that moment, Rudolph could have struck down the one sure friend he
had in China.CHAPTER VII


IPHIGENIA

"Don't chop off a hen's head with a battle-axe."Heywood, still with a
malicious, friendly quirk at the corners of his mouth, held in his
fretful pony.Rudolph stood bending a whip viciously.They two had
fetched a compass about the town, and now in the twilight were parting
before the nunnery gate."A tiff's the last thing I'd want with you.The
lady, in confidence, is not worth--"

"I do not wish," declared Rudolph, trembling,--"I do not wish you to say
those things, so!"laughed the other, and his pony wheeled at the word."I'll give
you one month--no: you're such a good, thorough little chap, it will
take longer--two months, to change your mind.Only"--he looked down at
Rudolph with a comic, elderly air--"let me observe, our yellow people
have that rather neat proverb.A hen's head, dear chap,--not with a
battle-axe!No sorrows of Werther, now,
over such"--He laughed again."Don't scowl, I'll be good.You'll supply the word, in two months!"He let the pony have his way, and was off in a clatter.Lonely, fuming
with resentment, Rudolph stared after him.What could he know, this
airy, unfeeling meddler, so free with his advice and innuendo?Let him
go, then, let him canter away.He had seen quickly, guessed with a
diabolic shrewdness, yet would remain on the surface, always, of a
mystery so violent and so profound.The young man stalked into his
vacant nunnery in a rage, a dismal pomp of emotion: reason telling him
that a friend had spoken sense, imagination clothing him in the sceptred
pall of tragedy.Yet one of these unwelcome words had stuck: he was Werther, it was
true--a man who came too late.Another word was soon fulfilled; for the
hot weather came, sudden, tropical, ferocious.Without gradation, the
vernal days and languid noons were gone in a twinkling.The change came
like another act of a play.One morning--though the dawn stirred cool
and fragrant as all dawns before--the "boy" laid out Rudolph's white
tunic, slipped in the shining buttons, smeared pipe-clay on his heaviest
helmet; and Rudolph, looking from his window, saw that on the river, by
the same instinct, boatmen were stretching up their bamboo awnings.Breakfast was hardly ended, before river, and convex field, and huddling
red tiles of the town, lay under a blurred, quivering distortion.At night, against a glow of fiery umber, the western hills
broke sharp and thin as sheet-iron, while below them rose in flooding
mirage a bright strip of magical water.Thus, in these days, he rode for his exercise while the sun still lay
behind the ocean; and thus her lively, pointed face and wide blue eyes,
wondering or downcast or merry, were mingled in his thoughts with the
first rousing of the world, the beat of hoofs in cool silences, the wide
lights of creation over an aged, weary, alien empire.Their ponies
whinnying like old friends, they met, by chance or appointment, before
the power of sleep had lifted from eyes still new and strange against
the morning.Sometimes Chantel the handsome rode glowering beside them,
sometimes Gilly, erect and solid in the saddle, laid upon their talk all
the weight of his honest, tired commonplaces.But one morning she cantered up alone, laughing at her escape.His pony
bolted, and they raced along together as comrades happily join forces in
a headlong dream.Quivering bamboo swept behind them; the river, on
their other hand, met and passed in hurrying panorama.They had no time
for words, but only laughter.Words, indeed, had never yet advanced them
beyond that moment on the pagoda.And now, when their ponies fell into
a shambling trot, came the first impulse of speech.Her glowing face was now averted, her gesture was not for
him, but for the scene.The river, up which they had fled, now rested broad and quiet as a
shallow lake, burnished faintly, brooded over by a floating, increasing
light, not yet compounded into day.Tussocks, innumerable clods and
crumbs of vivid green, speckled all the nearer water.On some of these
storks meditated,--sage, pondering heads and urbane bodies perched high
on the frailest penciling of legs.In the whole expanse, no movement
came but when a distant bird, leaving his philosophic pose, plunged
downward after a fish.Beyond them rose a shapeless mound or isle, like
some half-organic monster grounded in his native ooze."Are you all excuses, like the
others?"I am not afraid of anything--now," retorted Rudolph, and with truth,
after the dash of their twilight encounter."Go see what's on that island," she answered.Twice
I've seen natives land there and hurry away.Nesbit was too lazy to
try; Dr.Maurice Heywood refused to
mire his horse for a whim.In a rare flush of pride, Rudolph wheeled his stubborn mount and bullied
him down the bank.A poor horseman, he would have outstripped Curtius to
the gulf.But no sooner had his dancing pony consented to make the first
rebellious, sidelong plunge, than he had small joy of his boast.Fore-legs sank floundering, were hoisted with a terrified wrench of the
shoulders, in the same moment that hind-legs went down as by suction.The pony squirmed, heaved, wrestled in a frenzy, and churning the red
water about his master's thighs, went deeper and fared worse.With a
clangor of wings, the storks rose, a streaming rout against the sky,
trailed their tilted legs, filed away in straggling flight, like figures
interlacing on a panel.At the height of his distress, Rudolph caught a
whirling glimpse of the woman above him, safe on firm earth, easy in her
saddle, and laughing.Quicksand, then, was a joke,--but he could not
pause for this added bewilderment.The pony, using a skill born of agony, had found somewhere a solid verge
and scrambled up, knee-deep, well out from the bank.With a splash,
Rudolph stood beside him among the tufts of salad green.As he patted
the trembling flanks, he heard a cry from the shore.She might laugh, but now he
would see this folly through.He tore off his coat, flung it across the
saddle, waded out alone through the tussocks, and shooting forward full
length in the turbid water, swam resolutely for the island.Sky and water brightened while he swam; and as he rose, wrapped in the
leaden weight of dripping clothes, the sun, before and above him,
touched wonderfully the quaggy bank and parched grasses.He lurched
ashore, his feet caked with enormous clods as of melting chocolate.A
filthy scramble left him smeared and disheveled on the summit.The mound lay vacant, a tangled patch, a fragment of
wilderness.Yet as he stood panting, there rose a puny, miserable sound.The distress, it might be, of some small
animal--a rabbit dying in a forgotten trap.Faint as illusion, a wail, a
thin-spun thread of sorrow, broke into lonely whimpering, and ceased.He
moved forward, doubtfully, and of a sudden, in the scrubby level of the
isle, stumbled on the rim of a shallow circular depression.At first, he could not believe the discovery; but next instant--as at
the temple pond, though now without need of placard or interpreter--he
understood.This bowl, a tiny crater among the weeds, showed like some
paltry valley of Ezekiel, a charnel place of Herod's innocents, the
battlefield of some babes' crusade.A chill struck him, not from the
water or the early mists.In stupor, he viewed that savage fact.Through the stillness of death sounded again the note of living
discontent.He was aware also of some stir, even before he spied, under
a withered clump, the saffron body of an infant girl, feebly squirming.By a loathsome irony, there lay beside her an earthen bowl of rice, as
an earnest or symbol of regret.Blind pity urged him into the atrocious hollow.Seeing no further than
the present rescue, he caught up the small unclean sufferer, who moaned
the louder as he carried her down the bank, and waded out through the
sludge.To hold the squalling mouth above water, and swim, was no simple
feat; yet at last he came floundering among the tussocks, wrapped the
naked body in his jacket, and with infinite pains tugged his terrified
pony along a tortuous bar to the land.Once in the river-path, he stood gloomily, and let Mrs.Forrester canter
up to join him.But what can you have
brought back?He turned on her a muddy, haggard face, without enthusiasm, and gently
unfolded the coat.The man and the woman looked down together, in
silence, at the child.He had some foolish hope that she would take it,
that his part was ended.Like an outlandish doll, with face contorted
and thick-lidded eyes shut tightly against the sunshine, the outcast
whimpered, too near the point of death for even the rebellion of
arms and legs.The woman in the saddle gave a short, incredulous cry.Her face, all gay
curiosity, had darkened in a shock of disgust.Such a nasty little--Why
did--What do you propose doing with it?"Rudolph shook his head, like a man caught in some stupid blunder."I never thought of that," he explained heavily.With a sombre, disappointed air, he obeyed; then looked up, as if in her
face he read strange matter."I can't bear," she added quickly, "to see any kind of suffering.Why
did--It's all my fault for sending you!We were having such a good ride
together, and now I've spoiled it all, with this.--Poor little filthy
object!"She turned her hands outward, with a helpless, dainty gesture.His thoughts, then, had wronged
her.Drenched and downhearted, holding this strange burden in his
jacket, he felt that he had foolishly meddled in things inevitable,
beyond repair.Yet some vague, insurgent instinct, which
would not down, told him that there had been a disappointment.Then suddenly he mounted, bundle and all, and turned his willing pony
homeward."Come," he said; and for the first time, unwittingly, had taken charge.Without waiting, he beckoned her to follow.They rode stirrup to stirrup, silent as in their escape at
dawn, and as close bodily, but in spirit traveling distant parallels.He
gave no thought to that, riding toward his experiment.Near the town, at
last, he reined aside to a cluster of buildings,--white walls and rosy
tiles under a great willow."You may save your steps," she declared, with sudden petulance."The
hospital's more out of funds than ever, and more crowded.Rudolph nodded back at her, with a queer smile, half reckless and half
confident."Then," he replied, dismounting, "I will replenish my nunnery."Squatting coolies sprang up and raced to hold his pony.Others, in the
shade of the wall, cackled when they saw a Son of the Red-Haired so
beplastered and sopping.A few pointed at his bundle, with grunts of
sudden interest; and a leper, bearing the visage as of a stone lion
defaced by time, cried something harshly.At his words, the whole band
of idlers began to chatter.An
uneasy light troubled the innocent blue eyes, which had not even a
glance for him."No, I shan't get down," she said angrily."It's just what might
be--Your little brat will bring no good to any of us."He flung away defiantly, strode through the gate, and calling aloud,
traversed an empty compound, already heated by the new-risen sun.A
cooler fringe of veranda, or shallow cloister, lined a second court.Two
figures met him,--the dark-eyed Miss Drake, all in white, and behind
her a shuffling, grinning native woman, who carried a basin, in which
permanganate of potash swam gleaming like diluted blood.With one droll look of amusement, the girl had
understood, and regained that grave yet happy, friendly composure which
had the virtue, he discovered, of being easily forgotten, to be met each
time like something new.The naked mite lay very still, the breath weakly fluttered.A somewhat
nauseous gift, the girl raised her arms and received it gently, without
haste,--the saffron body appearing yet more squalid against the
Palladian whiteness of her tunic, plain and cool as drapery in marble.And followed by the
black-trousered woman, she moved quickly away to offer battle with
death.A plain, usual fact, it seemed, involving no more surprise than
repugnance.Her face had hardly altered; and yet Rudolph, for the first
time in many days, had caught the fleeting brightness of compassion.Mere light of the eyes, a half-imagined glory, incongruous in the sharp
smell of antiseptics, it left him wondering in the cloister.He knew now
what had been missing by the river."I was naked, and"--how ran the
lines?He turned to go, recalling in a whirl snatches of truth he had
never known since boyhood, never seen away from home.Across a court the padre hailed him,--a tall, ungainly patriarch under
an enormous mushroom helmet of solar pith,--and walking along beside,
listened shrewdly to his narrative.The
padre, nodding, frowning slightly, stood at ease, all angles and loose
joints, as if relaxed by the growing heat.The leper, without, harangued from his place apart, in a raucous voice
filled with the solitary pride of intellect."Well, men shall revile you," growled Dr."He says we steal
children, to puncture their eyes for magic medicine!"Then, heaving his wide shoulders,--

"Oh, well!"he said wearily, "thanks, anyhow.Come see us, when we're
not so busy?Good!--Look out these fellows don't fly at you."Tired and befouled, Rudolph passed through into the torrid glare.The
leper cut short his snarling oration.But without looking at him, the
young man took the bridle from the coolie.He had
seen a child, and two women.And yet it was with a pang he found that
Mrs.CHAPTER VIII


THE HOT NIGHT

Rudolph paced his long chamber like a wolf,--a wolf in summer, with too
thick a coat.In sweat of body and heat of mind, he crossed from window
to window, unable to halt.A faintly sour smell of parched things, oppressing the night without
breath or motion, was like an interminable presence, irritating,
poisonous.The punkah, too, flapped incessant, and only made the lamp
gutter.Broad leaves outside shone in mockery of snow; and like snow the
stifled river lay in the moonlight, where the wet muzzles of buffaloes
glistened, floating like knots on sunken logs, or the snouts of
crocodiles.Birds fluttered, sleepless and wretched.Coolies, flung
asleep on the burnt grass, might have been corpses, but for the sound of
their troubled breathing."If I could believe," he groaned, sitting with hands thrust through his
hair."If I believe in her--But I came too late."He sprang up from it, wiped the drops off
his forehead, and paced again.The collar
of his tunic strangled him.He stuffed his fingers underneath, and
wrenched; then as he came and went, catching sight in a mirror, was
shocked to see that, in Biblical fashion, he had rent his garments."This is bad," he thought, staring.He shouted, clapped his hands for a servant, and at last, snatching a
coat from his unruffled boy, hurried away through stillness and
moonlight to the detested club.On the stairs a song greeted him,--a
fragment with more breath than melody, in a raw bass:--


"Jolly boating weather,
And a hay harvest breeze!"The loft was like a cave heated by subterranean fires.Two long punkahs
flapped languidly in the darkness, with a whine of pulleys.Under a
swinging lamp, in a pool of light and heat, four men sat playing cards,
their tousled heads, bare arms, and cinglets torn open across the chest,
giving them the air of desperadoes."Jolly boating weather," wheezed the fat Sturgeon.He stood apart in
shadow, swaying on his feet."What would you give," he propounded
thickly, "for a hay harvest breeze?"He climbed, or rolled, upon the billiard-table, turned head toward
punkah, and suddenly lay still,--a gross white figure, collapsed and
sprawling."How much does he think a man can stand?"snapped Nesbit, his lean
Cockney face pulled in savage lines.He'll die
to-night, drinking.""Die yourself," mumbled the singer, "'m goin' sleep.A groan from the players, and the vicious flip of a card, acknowledged
the hit.Rudolph joined them, ungreeting and ungreeted.The game went on
grimly, with now and then the tinkle of ice, or the popping of soda
bottles.Sharp cords and flaccid folds in Wutzler's neck, Chantel's
brown cheeks, the point of Heywood's resolute chin, shone wet and
polished in the lamplight.All four men scowled pugnaciously, even the
pale Nesbit, who was winning.Bad temper filled the air, as palpable as
the heat and stink of the burning oil.Only Heywood maintained a febrile gayety, interrupting the game
perversely, stirring old Wutzler to incoherent speech.cried the outcast, with sudden enthusiasm."In your
paper _Tit-bit_, I read.How dey climb der walls op, yes, but Rome is
safed by a flook of geeze.Gracious me, der History iss great sopjeck!I lern moch.--But iss Rome yet a fortify town?"Chantel rapped out a Parisian oath."Do we play cards," he cried sourly, "or listen to the chatter of
senility?""No, Wutz, that town's no longer fortified," he answered slowly."Geese
live there, still, as in--many other places."Chantel examined his finger-tips as though for some defect; then,
snatching up the cards, shuffled and dealt with intense precision."I read alzo," stammered Wutzler, like a timid scholar encouraged to
lecture, "I read zo how your Englishman, Rawf Ralli, he spreadt der fine
clock for your Queen, and lern your Queen smoking, no?"He mopped his
lean throat with the back of his hand.Next instant he whirled on
Rudolph in fury.--"Is this a game, or Idiot's Joy?""I'm playing my best," explained Rudolph, sulkily."Then your best is the worst I ever saw!Chantel laughed, without merriment; Rudolph flung down his cards,
stalked to the window, and stood looking out, in lonely, impotent rage.A long time passed, marked by alarming snores from the billiard-table.The half-naked watchers played on, in ferocious silence.Chantel broke out as though the talk
had but paused a moment."Fools will always sit in, when they do not
know.They rush into the water, also, and play the hero!"Heywood had left his cards,
risen, and crossing the room, stood looking over Rudolph's shoulder into
the snowy moonlight.On the shoulder his hand rested, as by accident."It's the heat, old chap," he said wearily."Don't mind what we say
to-night."Rudolph made no sign, except to move from under his hand, so that, with
their quarrel between them, the two men stared out across the blanched
roofs and drooping trees, where long black shadows at last crept
toward the dawn.They make it for the rest of us, so easily!Do you know," his voice rose
and quickened, "do you know, the other end of town is in an uproar?We
murder children, it appears, for medicine!"Rudolph started, turned, but now sat quiet under Heywood's grasp.Chantel, in the lamplight, watched the punkahs with a hateful smile."The Gascons are not all dead," he murmured."They plunge us all into a
turmoil, for the sake of a woman."He made a sudden startling gesture,
like a man who has lost control."For the sake," he cried angrily, "of a
person we all know!She is nothing more--"

There was a light scuffle at the window.Chantel," began Heywood, with a sharp and dangerous courtesy, "we
are all unlike ourselves to-night.I am hardly the person to remind you,
but this club is hardly the place--"

"Oh, la la!"The other snapped his fingers, and reverting to his native
tongue, finished his sentence wildly.Heywood advanced in long strides deliberately, as if
gathering momentum for a collision.Before his blow could fall, he was
sent spinning.Rudolph, his cheeks on fire, darted past and dealt, full
force, a clumsy backhand sweep of the arm.Light and quick as a leopard,
Chantel was on foot, erect, and even while his chair crashed on the
floor, had whipped out a handkerchief.Heywood," he said, stanching his lips, in icy
composure.His eyes held an odd gleam of satisfaction.Sturgeon to
see your friend to-morrow morning.Not without dignity, he turned, stepped quickly to the stairs, saluted
gravely, and went down.panted Nesbit, wrestling with Rudolph.Heywood wrenched the captive loose, but only to shake him violently, and
thrust him into a chair."I've a great mind, myself, to
run after the bounder and kick him.But that sort of thing--you did
enough.Chantel took you on,
exactly as he wanted."Wutzler came slinking back from his
refuge in the shadows.With arms folded, he eyed them sternly.By Jove,
you must let me fight that beast.The idiot, nobody fights duels
any more.I've always--His cuffs are always dirty, too, on the inside!"Rudolph leaned back, like a man refreshed and comforted, but his laugh
was unsteady, and too boisterous."Pistol-bullets--they fly on the wings of
chance!My dear young gentleman," scoffed his friend, "there's not a
pair of matched pistols in the settlement.And if there were, Chantel
has the choice.He paused, in a silence that grew somewhat menacing.From a slit in the
wall the wheel of the punkah-thong whined insistently,--rise and fall,
rise and fall of peevish complaint, distressing as a brain-fever bird."Swords, of course," continued Heywood.Fencing,--oh, I hate the man, and the art's by-gone, if you like, but
he's a beautiful swordsman!Rudolph still lay back, but now with a singular calm."It's just as well," he declared quietly.Heywood loosed a great breath, a sigh of vast relief."So you're there, too, eh?If you're another expert--Bravo!We'll beat him at his own
game!Hoist with his own what-d'-ye-call-it!I'd give anything"--He
thumped the table, and pitched the cards broadcast, like an explosion of
confetti, in a little carnival of glee."You old Sly-boots!--But are you
sure?"I am not afraid," replied Rudolph, modestly.He trained his young
moustache upward with steady fingers, and sat very quiet, thinking long
thoughts."Now let him come, as the Lord Mayor said
of the hare.With an even chance--And what a load off
one's mind!"He moved away to the window, as though searching for air.Instead of
moonlight, without, there swam the blue mist of dawn."Not a word must ever reach old Gilly," he mused."If you think," retorted the clerk, stiffly, "I don't know the proper
course of be'aviour!The tall silhouette in the window made no reply, but stood grumbling
privately: "A club!Yes, where we drink out of jam-pots--dead cushions,
dead balls--no veranda--fellow that soils the inside of his cuffs first!We're a pack of beach-combers."He propped his elbows on the long sill, and leaned out, venting
fragments of disgust.Then of a sudden he turned, and beckoned eagerly.Gray vapors from river and paddy-field, lingering
like steam in a slow breeze, paled and dispersed in the growing light,
as the new day, worse than the old, came sullenly without breath or
respite.A few twilight shapes were pattering through the narrow
street--a squad of Yamen runners haling a prisoner."The Sword-Pen remains active," said Heywood, thoughtfully."That dingy
little procession, do you know, it's quite theatrical?Even Rudolph could spare a misgiving from his own difficulty while he
watched the prisoner.It was Chok Chung, the plump Christian merchant,
slowly trudging toward the darkest of human courts, to answer for the
death of the cormorant-fisher.Rudolph saw again
the lighted shop, the tumbled figure retching on the floor; and with
these came a memory of that cold and scornful face, thinking so cruelly
among the unthinking rabble.The Sword-Pen had written something in
the dark."I go find out"; and Wutzler was away, as keen as a village gossip."Trouble's comin'," Nesbit asserted glibly.He stretched his arms, with a weary howl."That's the
first yawn I've done to-night.I'm off--seek
my downy."Alone with the grunting sleeper, the two friends sat for a long time and
watched the flooding daylight."What," began Rudolph, suddenly, and his voice trembled, "what is your
true opinion?You are so kind, and I was just a fool.That other day, I
would not listen.Now tell me, so--as you were to die next.Can I truly be proud of--of her?"He leaned forward, white and eager, waiting for the truth like a dicer
for the final throw.Poor old Gilly Forrester slaves here to send her junketing in Japan,
Kashmir, Ceylon, Home.What Chantel said--well, between the two of us,
I'm afraid he's right.So precious few of us, and trouble ahead.The natives lashing themselves into a state of mind, or being lashed.The least spark--Rough work ahead, and here we are at swords' points.""And the joke is," Rudolph added quietly, "I do not know a sword's point
from a handle."Heywood turned, glowered, and twice failed to speak."Rudie--old boy," he stammered, "that man--Preposterous!Rudolph stared straight ahead, without hope, without illusions, facing
the haggard light of morning.A few weeks ago he might have wept; but
now his laugh, short and humorous, was worthy of his companion."I do not care, more," he answered."Luck, so called I it, when I
escaped the militar' service.Luck, to pass into the _Ersatz!_--I
do not care, now.CHAPTER IX


PASSAGE AT ARMS

"Boy."Forrester bym-by come, you talkee he, master no got, you
chin-chin he come-back."The long-coated boy scuffed away, across the chunam floor, and
disappeared in the darkness.Heywood submitted his head once more to the
nimble hands of his groom, who, with horse-clippers and a pair of
enormous iron shears, was trimming the stubborn chestnut locks still
closer.The afternoon glow, reflected from the burnt grass and white
walls of the compound, struck upward in the vault-spaces of the ground
floor, and lighted oddly the keen-eyed yellow mafoo and his serious
young master.Nesbit, pert as a jockey, sat on the table swinging his feet furiously."Sturgeon would take it all right, of course," he said, with airy
wisdom."Not the least," Heywood assented gloomily.If I were commissioned to tell 'em outright--'The youngster can't
fence'--why, we might save the day.But our man won't even listen to
that.Chantel will see, on the spot, directly they
face.No fear: he's worked up to the pitch of
killing.He'll lunge first, and be surprised afterward.--So regrettable!Such remorse!--Oh, I know _him!_"

The Cockney fidgeted for a time.His face--the face of a street-bred
urchin--slowly worked into lines of abnormal cunning.Now--my boy used to be learn-pidgin at Chantel's.Knows that
'ouse inside out--loafs there now, the beggar, with Chantel's cook.Why
not send him over--prowling, ye know--fingers the bric-a-brac, bloomin'
ass, and breaks a sword-blade.'Can secure, all
plopah,' Accident, ye know.Heywood chuckled, and bowed his head to the horse-clippers.This afternoon's rather late for
accidents.You make me feel like Pompey on his galley: 'This thou
shouldst have done, and not have spoken on't,'--Besides, those swords
belonged to Chantel's father.He began as a gentleman.--But you're a
good sort, Nesbit, to take the affair this fashion."Lost in smoke, the clerk grumbled that the gory affair was unmentionable
nonsense.Then suddenly the gray eyes lighted, became both shrewd and
distant; a malicious little smile stole about the corners of his mouth.And this
one--by Jove, it won't leave either of 'em a leg to stand on!--Here,
mafoo, makee finish!"He sprang up, clapped a helmet on the shorn head, and stalked out into
the sunlight.We must pick up our young
Hotspur."The clerk followed, through the glowing compound and the road.In the
shade of the nunnery gate they found Rudolph, who, raising his rattan,
saluted them with a pale and stoic gravity.he asked; and turning, took a slow, cool survey of the
nunnery, as though looking his last--from the ditch at their feet to the
red tiles, patched with bronze mould, that capped the walls and the
roof."I never left any place with less regret.The three men had covered some ground before Rudolph broke the silence."You'll find a few little things up there in my strong-box, Maurice.Some are marked for you, and the rest--will you send them Home, please?""I hope neither of you will misunderstand me.I'm horribly
afraid, but not--but only because this fellow will make me look absurd."I cannot bear to
have him laugh, also!Heywood clapped him on the shoulder, and gave a queer cough."If that's all, never you fear!'Once in a
while we can finish in style.'Eh?--Rudie, you blooming German, I--I
think we must have been brothers!Heywood spoke with a strange alacrity, and tried again to cough.This
time, however, there was no mistake--he was laughing.Rudolph shot at him one glance of startled unbelief, and then, tossing
his head, marched on without a word.The two at his side were no companions--not even presences.He
went alone, conscious only of the long flood of sunset, and the black
interlacing pattern of bamboos.The one friendly spirit had deserted,
laughing; yet even this last and worst of earthly puzzles did not
matter.It was true, what he had read; this, which they called death,
was a lonely thing.On a broken stone bench, Sturgeon, sober and dejected, with puffy
circles under his eyes, sat waiting.A long parcel, wrapped in green
baize, lay across his knees.At his
feet wandered a path, rankly matted with burnt weeds, and bordered with
green bottle-ends, the "dimples" choked with discs of mud.The place was
a deserted garden, where the ruins of a European house--burnt by natives
in some obscure madness, years ago--sprawled in desolation among wild
shrubs.A little way down the path stood Teppich and Chantel, each with
his back turned and his hands clasped, like a pair of sulky Napoleons,
one fat, one slender.The wooden pretense of their attitude set Rudolph,
for an instant, to laughing silently and bitterly.This final
scene,--what justice, that it should be a mean waste, the wreck of silly
pleasure-grounds, long forgotten, and now used only by grotesque
play-actors.He must die, in both action and setting, without dignity.It was some comfort, he became aware, to find that the place was fairly
private.Except for the breach by which they had entered, the blotched
and spotted compound walls stood ruinous yet high, shutting out all but
a rising slant of sunlight, and from some outpost line of shops, near
by, the rattle of an abacus and the broken singsong of argument, now
harsh, now drowsy.Heywood had been speaking earnestly to Sturgeon:--

"A little practice--try the balance of the swords.Most certainly," croaked that battered convivialist.He rose, and waddled down the path.Rudolph saw Chantel turn, frowning,
then nod and smile.The nod was courteous, the smile full of satire."Right-oh," he puffed, tugging from the baize cover a shining pair of
bell-hilted swords.His puffy eyes turned furtively
toward Rudolph."May be bad form, Hackh, but--we all wish you luck, I
fancy."Then, in a burst of candor, "Wish that unspeakable ass felt as
seedy as I do--heat-stroke--drop dead--that sort of thing."Still grumbling treason, this strange second rejoined his principal."Jackets off," commanded Heywood; and in their cinglets, each with sword
under arm, the two friends took shelter behind a ragged clump of
plantains.The yellow leaves, half dead with drought and blight, hung
ponderous as torn strips of sheet metal in the lifeless air.Behind this tattered screen, Rudolph studied, for a moment, the lethal
object in his hand.It was very graceful,--the tapering, three-cornered
blade, with shallow grooves in which blood was soon to run, the silver
hilt where his enemy's father had set, in florid letters, the name of
"H.B.A. Chantel," and a date.How long ago, he thought, the steel
was forged for this day."Come, show me how to begin; so that I
can stand up to him."Slowly, easily, his long limbs transformed with a sudden
youthful grace, Heywood moved through the seven positions of On
Guard.Rudolph learned only that his own clumsy imitation was hopeless."Once more.--He can't see us."Again and again, more and more rapidly, they performed the motions of
this odd rehearsal.Suddenly Heywood stepped back, and lowering his
point, looked into his pupil's face, long and earnestly."For the last time," he said: "won't you let me tell him?Rudolph hung his head, like a stubborn child."Do you still think," he answered coldly, "that I would beg off?"With a hopeless gesture of impatience, Heywood stepped forward briskly.And as their blades clashed softly
together, a quick light danced in his eyes."Here's how our friend will
stick you!"His point cut a swift little circle, and sped home.By a
wild instinct, the novice beat it awkwardly aside.His friend laughed,
poised again, disengaged again, but in mid-career of this heartless
play, stumbled and came pitching forward.Rudolph darted back, swept his
arm blindly, and cried out; for with the full impetus of the mishap, a
shock had run from wrist to elbow.He dropped his sword, and in
stupefaction watched the red blood coursing down his forearm, and his
third finger twitching convulsively, beyond control.I say,
that's a bad one."With a stick and a handkerchief, he twisted on a
tourniquet, muttering condolence: "Pain much?Then, dodging out from the
plantain screen, and beckoning,--"All you chaps!Nesbit came running, but at sight of the bloody victim, pulled up short.he whispered, first with a stare, then a grin of mysterious
joy.Sturgeon gave a sympathetic whistle, and stolidly unwound bandages.At first the two Napoleons remained aloof, but at last, yielding to
indignant shouts, haughtily approached.Heywood wiped his sword-blade very carefully on a plantain leaf; then
stood erect, to address them with a kind of cool severity."I regret this more than anybody," he declared, pausing, and picking his
words."We were at practice, and my friend had the misfortune to be run
through the arm."Chantel flung out his hands, in a motion at once furious and impudent.What a farce!--Will you tell me, please, since your friend has
disabled himself"--

Heywood wheeled upon him, scornfully."You have no right to such an expression," he stated, with a coldness
which conveyed more rage than the other man's heat.It's I who have spoiled your--arrangement, and therefore I am
quite ready to take up my friend's quarrel.""I have no quarrel with you," replied Chantel, contemptuously."You saw
last night how he--"

"He was quicker than I, that's all.By every circumstance, I'm the
natural proxy.Besides"--the young man appealed to the company,
smiling--"besides, what a pity to postpone matters, and spoil the
occasion, when Doctor Chantel has gone to the trouble of a clean shirt."The doctor recoiled, flung up a trembling arm, and as quickly dropped
it.His handsome face burned darker, then faded with a mortal pallor,
and for one rigid moment, took on such a strange beauty as though it
were about to be translated into bronze.His brown fingers twitched,
became all nerves and sinews and white knuckles.Then, stepping
backward, he withdrew from the circle."Since we are all so--irregular.Rudolph gave a choking cry, and would have come forward; but Sturgeon
clung to the wounded arm, and bound on his bandage.he scolded, as though addressing a horse; then
growled in Heywood's ear, "Why did _you_ go lose your temper?"We can't let him walk over us, though."The young man held the
sword across his throat, and whispered, "Only angry up to here!"And indeed, through the anxious preliminary silence, he stood waiting as
cool and ready as a young centurion.His adversary, turning back the sleeves of the unfortunate white linen,
picked up the other sword, and practiced his fingering on the silver
hilt, while the blade answered as delicately as the bow to a violinist.At last he came forward, with thin lips and hard, thoughtful eyes, like
a man bent upon dispatch.Both men saluted formally, and sprang
on guard.From the first twitter of the blades, even Rudolph knew the outcome.Heywood, his face white and anxious in the failing light, fought at full
stretch, at the last wrench of skill.Chantel, for the moment, was
fencing; and though his attacks came ceaseless and quick as flame, he
was plainly prolonging them, discarding them, repeating, varying,
whether for black-hearted merriment, or the vanity of perfect form, or
love of his art.Graceful, safe, easy, as though performing the grand
salute, he teased and frolicked, his bright blade puzzling the sight,
scattering like quicksilver in the endless whirl and clash.Teppich was gaping foolishly, Sturgeon shaking his head, the Cockney,
with narrow body drawn together, watching, shivering, squatting on toes
and finger-tips, like a runner about to spring from a mark.Rudolph,
dizzy with pain and suspense, nursed his forearm mechanically.The
hurried, silver ring of the hilts dismayed him, the dust from the garden
path choked him like an acrid smoke.Suddenly Chantel, dropping low like a deflected arrow, swooped in with
fingers touching the ground.On "three feet," he had delivered the blow
so long withheld.But Heywood, by some
desperate sleight, had parried the certainty, and even tried a riposte.Still afoot and fighting, he complained testily above the sword-play:--

"Don't shout like that!Above the sword-play, too, came gradually a murmur of voices.Through
the dust, beyond the lunging figures, Rudolph was distantly aware of
crowded bodies, of yellow faces grinning or agape, in the breach of the
compound wall.Men of the neighboring hamlet had gathered, to watch the
foreign monsters play at this new, fantastic game.Shaven heads bobbed,
saffron arms pointed, voices, sharp and guttural, argued scornfully.The hilts rang, the blades grated faster.But now it was plain that
Heywood could do no more, by luck or inspiration.Fretted by his clumsy
yet strong and close defense, Chantel was forcing on the end.Instantly, all saw the weaker blade fly wide, the
stronger swerve, to dart in victorious,--and then saw Doctor Chantel
staggering backward, struck full in the face by something round and
heavy.Another struck a bottle-end, and burst into milk-white fragments, like a
bomb.A third, rebounding from Teppich's girdle, left him bent and
gasping.Strange yells broke out, as from a tribe of apes.The air was
thick with hurtling globes.Cocoanuts rained upon the company,
tempestuously, as though an invisible palm were shaken by a hurricane.Among them flew sticks, jagged lumps of sun-dried clay, thick scales
of plaster.cried Nesbit, "the bloomin' coolies!"First to recover, he
skipped about, fielding and hurling back cocoanuts.A small but raging phalanx crowded the gap in the wall, throwing
continually, howling, and exhorting one another to rush in.cried Heywood, and started, sword in hand.But it was Nesbit who, wrenching a pair of loose bottles from the path,
brandishing them aloft like clubs, and shouting the unseemly
battle-cries of a street-fighter, led the white men into this deadly
breach.At the first shock, the rioters broke and scattered, fled round
corners of the wall, crashed through bamboos, went leaping across
paddy-fields toward the river.The tumult--except for lonely howls in
the distance--ended as quickly as it had risen.The little band of
Europeans returned from the pursuit, drenched with sweat, panting, like
a squad of triumphant football players; but no one smiled."That explains it," grumbled Heywood.He pointed along the path to
where, far off, a tall, stooping figure paced slowly toward the town,
his long robe a moving strip of color, faint in the twilight."The
Sword-Pen dropped some remarks in passing."The others nodded moodily, too breathless for reply.Nesbit's forehead
bore an ugly cut, Rudolph's bandage was red and sopping.Chantel, more
rueful than either, stared down at a bleeding hand, which held two
shards of steel.He had fallen, and snapped his sword in the rubble of
old masonry."No more blades," he said, like a child with a broken toy; "there are no
more blades this side of Saigon."Heywood mopped his dripping and fiery cheeks.He tossed a piece of silver to one who wailed in the ditch,--a forlorn
stranger from Hai-nan, lamenting the broken shells and empty baskets of
his small venture.--"Contribution, you chaps.A bad day for imported
cocoanuts.Wish I carried some money: this chit system is
damnable.--Meanwhile, doctor, won't you forget anything I was rude
enough to say?And come join me in a peg at the club?CHAPTER X


THREE PORTALS

Not till after dinner, that evening, did Rudolph rouse from his stupor.With the clerk, he lay wearily in the upper chamber of Heywood's house.The host, with both his long legs out at window, sat watching the smoky
lights along the river, and now and then cursing the heat."After all," he broke silence, "those cocoanuts came time enough."said Nesbit, jauntily; and fingering the plaster
cross on his wounded forehead, drawled: "You might think I'd done a bit
o' dueling myself, by the looks.--But I had _some_ part.But for me, you might never have
thought o' that--"

"Idiot!"snapped Heywood, and pulling in his legs, rose and stamped
across the room.A glass of ice and tansan smashed on the floor.Rudolph was on foot,
clutching his bandaged arm as though the hurt were new.Felt soles scuffed in the darkness, and through the door, his yellow
face wearing a placid and lofty grin, entered Ah Pat, the compradore."One coolie-man hab-got chit."He handed a note to his master, who snatched it as though glad of the
interruption, bent under the lamp, and scowled.The writing was in a crabbed, antique German character:--

"Please to see bearer, in bad clothes but urgent._Um Gottes willen_--" It straggled off, illegible.The signature, "Otto
Wutzler," ran frantically into a blot."You talkee he, come topside."The messenger must have been waiting, however, at the stairhead; for no
sooner had the compradore withdrawn, than a singular little coolie
shuffled into the room.Lean and shriveled as an opium-smoker, he wore
loose clothes of dirty blue,--one trousers-leg rolled up.The brown
face, thin and comically small, wore a mask of inky shadow under a
wicker bowl hat.His eyes were cast down in a strange fashion, unlike
the bold, inquisitive peering of his countrymen,--the more strange, in
that he spoke harshly and abruptly, like a racer catching breath.His dialect was the vilest and surliest form of the
colloquial "Clear Speech.""You can speak and act more civilly," retorted Heywood, "or taste the
bamboo."The man did not answer, or look up, or remove his varnished hat.Still
downcast and hang-dog, he sidled along the verge of the shadow, snatched
from the table the paper and a pencil, and choosing the darkest part of
the wall, began to write.The lamp stood between him and the company:
Heywood alone saw--and with a shock of amazement--that he did not print
vertically as with a brush, but scrawled horizontally.He tossed back
the paper, and dodged once more into the gloom.The postscript ran in the same shaky hand:--

"Send way the others both."cried the young master of the house; and then over his shoulder,
"Excuse us a moment--me, I should say."He led the dwarfish coolie across the landing, to the deserted
dinner-table.The creature darted past him, blew out one candle, and
thrust the other behind a bottle, so that he stood in a wedge of shadow."Eng-lish speak I ver' badt," he whispered; and then with something
between gasp and chuckle, "but der _pak-wa_ goot, no?When der live
dependt, zo can mann--" He caught his breath, and trembled in a
strong seizure.You
_are_ a coolie"--Wutzler's conical wicker-hat ducked as from a blow.I mean, you're--"

The shrunken figure pulled itself together."You are right," he whispered, in the vernacular."To-night I am a
coolie--all but the eyes.Heywood stepped back to the door, and popped his head out.All day I ran
about the town, finding out.The trial of Chok Chung, your--_our_
Christian merchant--I saw him 'cross the hall.'They kept asking, 'Do
you follow the foreign dogs and goats?'But he would only answer, 'I
follow the Lord Jesus.'So then they beat out his teeth with a heavy
shoe, and cast him into prison.Now they wait, to see if his padre will
interfere with the law.The suit is certainly brought by
Fang the scholar, whom they call the Sword-Pen.""That much," said Heywood, "I could have told you."Wutzler glanced behind him fearfully, as though the flickering shadows
might hear.Since dark I ran everywhere, watching, listening to
gossip.I painted my skin with mangrove-bark water.He patted his right leg, where the roll of trousers bound his
thigh.It says, 'I am a
Heaven-and-Earth man.'"The other faltered, and hung his head."My--my wife's cousin, he is a Grass
Sandal.He taught her the verses at home, for safety.--We mean no harm,
now, we of the Triad.But there is another secret band, having many of
our signs.Fang the scholar heads their
lodge.They meet to-night," said the outcast, in sudden grief and
passion.Are _you_ married to
these people?Does the knowledge come so cheap, or at a price?All these
years--darkness--sunken--alone"--He trembled violently, but regained his
voice.This very night they swear in recruits, and set the
day."Right," said Heywood, curtly.Wutzler's head dropped on his breast again.The varnished hat gleamed
softly in the darkness."I--I dare not stay," he sobbed.You came away without it!--We sit tight, then, and wait in
ignorance."The droll, withered face, suddenly raised, shone with great tears that
streaked the mangrove stain."My head sits loosely already, with what I have done to-night.I found a
listening place--next door: a long roof.You can hear and see them--But
I could not stay."I didn't mean--Here, have
a drink."The man drained the tumbler at a gulp; stood without a word, sniffing
miserably; then of a sudden, as though the draught had worked, looked up
bold and shrewd."Do _you_ dare go to the place I show you, and
hide?Heywood started visibly, paused, then laughed."_Tu quoque_ is good argument.Can you smuggle
me?--Then come on."He stepped lightly across the landing, and called
out, "You chaps make yourselves at home, will you?And as he followed the
slinking form downstairs, he grumbled, "If at all, perhaps."The moon still lurked behind the ocean, making an aqueous pallor above
the crouching roofs.The two men hurried along a "goat" path, skirted
the town wall, and stole through a dark gate into a darker maze of
lonely streets.Drawing nearer to a faint clash of cymbals in some
joss-house, they halted before a blind wall."In the first room," whispered the guide, "a circle is drawn on the
floor.Put your right foot there, and say, 'We are all in-the-circle
men,' If they ask, remember: you go to pluck the White Lotus.These men
hate it, they are Triad brothers, they will let you pass.You come from
the East, where the Fusang cocks spit orient pearls; you studied in the
Red Flower Pavilion; your eyes are bloodshot because"--He lectured
earnestly, repeating desperate nonsense, over and over.They held a hurried catechism in the dark."There," sighed Wutzler, at last, "that is as much as we can hope.They will pass you through hidden ways.--But you are very
rash.Receiving no answer, he sighed more heavily, and gave a complicated
knock.Bars clattered within, and a strip of dim light widened.said a harsh but guarded voice, with a strong Hakka brogue."A brother," answered the outcast, "to pluck the White Lotus.Aid,
brothers.--Go in, I can help no further.If you are caught, slide down,
and run westward to the gate which is called the Meeting of
the Dragons."Beside a leaf-point flame of peanut-oil,
a broad, squat giant sat stiff and still against the opposite wall, and
stared with cruel, unblinking eyes.If the stranger were the first white
man to enter, this motionless grim janitor gave no sign.On the earthen
floor lay a small circle of white lime.Heywood placed his right foot
inside it."We are all in-the-circle men."Out from shadow glided a tall native with a halberd, who opened a door
in the far corner.In the second room, dim as the first, burned the same smoky orange light
on the same table.But here a twisted <DW36>, his nose long and
pendulous with elephantiasis, presided over three cups of tea set in a
row.Heywood lifted the central cup, and drank.asked the second guard, in a soft and husky
bass.As he spoke, the great nose trembled slightly."No, I will bite ginger," replied the white man."It is a melon-face--a green face with a red heart.""Pass," said the <DW36>, gently.He pulled a cord--the nose quaking
with this exertion--and opened the third door.A venerable man in gleaming silks--a
grandfather, by his drooping rat-tail moustaches--sat fanning himself.In the breath of his black fan, the lamplight tossed queer shadows
leaping, and danced on the table of polished camagon.Except for this
unrest, the aged face might have been carved from yellow soapstone.But
his slant eyes were the sharpest yet."You have come far," he said, with sinister and warning courtesy.Too far, thought Heywood, in a sinking heart; but answered:--

"From the East, where the Fusang cocks spit orient pearls.""The book," said Heywood, holding his wits by his will, "the book was
Ten Thousand Thousand Pages.""The waters of the deluge crosswise flow.""And what"--the aged voice
rose briskly--"what saw you on the waters?""The Eight Abbots, floating," answered Heywood, negligently.--"But," ran
his thought, "he'll pump me dry.""Why," continued the examiner, "do you look so happy?"It seemed a hopeful sign; but
the keen old eyes were far from satisfied."Why have you such a sensual face?""Pass," said the old man, regretfully.And Heywood, glancing back from
the mouth of a dark corridor, saw him, beside the table of camagon,
wagging his head like a judge doubtful of his judgment.The narrow passage, hot, fetid, and blacker than the wholesome night
without, crooked about sharp corners, that bruised the wanderer's hands
and arms.Suddenly he fell down a short flight of slimy steps, landing
in noisome mud at the bottom of some crypt.A trap, a suffocating well,
he thought; and rose filthy, choked with bitterness and disgust.Only
the taunting justice of Wutzler's argument, the retort _ad hominem_, had
sent him headlong into this dangerous folly.He had scolded a coward
with hasty words, and been forced to follow where they led.Behind him, a door closed, a bar scraped softly into
place.Before him, as he groped in rage and self-reproach, rose a vault
of solid plaster, narrow as a chimney.But presently, glancing upward, he saw a small cluster of stars
blinking, voluptuous, immeasurably overhead.Their pittance of light, as
his eyesight cleared, showed a ladder rising flat against the wall.He
reached up, grasped the bamboo rungs, hoisted with an acrobatic wrench,
and began to climb cautiously.Above, faint and muffled, sounded a murmur of voices.CHAPTER XI


WHITE LOTUS

He was swarming up, quiet as a thief, when his fingers clawed the bare
plaster.The ladder hung from the square end of a protruding beam, above
which there were no more rungs.Then, to his great relief, something blacker than the starlight gathered
into form over his head,--a slanting bulk, which gradually took on a
familiar meaning.He chuckled, reached for it, and fingering the rough
edge to avoid loose tiles, hauled himself up to a foothold on the beam,
and so, flinging out his arms and hooking one knee, scrambled over and
lay on a ribbed and mossy surface, under the friendly stars.The outcast
and his strange brethren had played fair: this was the long roof, and
close ahead rose the wall of some higher building, an upright blackness
from which escaped two bits of light,--a right angle of hairbreadth
lines, and below this a brighter patch, small and ragged.Here, louder,
but confused with a gentle scuffing of feet, sounded the voices of the
rival lodge.Toward these he crawled, stopping at every creak of the tiles.Once a
broken roll snapped off, and slid rattling down the roof.He sat up,
every muscle ready for the sudden leap and shove that would send him
sliding after it into the lower darkness.It fell but a short distance,
into something soft.Gradually he relaxed, but lay very still.Nothing
followed; no one had heard.He tried again, crawled forward his own length, and brought up snug and
safe in the angle where roof met wall.The voices and shuffling feet
were dangerously close.He sat up, caught a shaft of light full in his
face, and peered in through the ragged chink.Two legs in bright,
wrinkled hose, and a pair of black shoes with thick white soles, blocked
the view.For a long time they shifted, uneasy and tantalizing.He could
hear only a hubbub of talk,--random phrases without meaning.The legs
moved away, and left a clear space.But at the same instant, a grating noise startled him, directly
overhead, out of doors.The thin right angle of light spread instantly
into a brilliant square.With a bang, a wooden shutter slid open.Heywood lay back swiftly, just as a long, fat bamboo pipe, two sleeves,
and the head of a man in a red silk cap were thrust out into the
night air."_ sighed the man, and puffed at his bamboo.Heywood tried to blot himself against the wall.The lounger, propped on
elbows, finished his smoke, spat upon the tiles, and remained, a pensive
silhouette."_ he sighed again; then knocking out the bamboo, drew in his
head.Not until the shutter slammed, did Heywood shake the burning
sparks from his wrist.In the same movement, however, he raised head and shoulders to spy
through the chink.This time the bright-hosed legs were gone.He saw
clear down a brilliant lane of robes and banners, multicolored, and
shining with embroidery and tinsel,--a lane between two ranks of crowded
men, who, splendid with green and blue and yellow robes of ceremony,
faced each other in a strong lamplight, that glistened on their oily
cheeks.Under the crowded rows of shaven
foreheads, their eyes blinked, deep-set and expectant.At the far end of
the loft, through two circular arches or giant hoops of rattan, Heywood
at last descried a third arch, of swords; beyond this, a tall incense
jar smouldering gray wisps of smoke, beside a transverse table twinkling
with candles like an altar; and over these, a black image with a pale,
carved face, seated bolt upright before a lofty, intricate, gilded
shrine of the Patriot War-God.A tall man in dove-gray silk with a high scarlet turban moved athwart
the altar, chanting as he solemnly lifted one by one a row of symbols: a
round wooden measure, heaped with something white, like rice, in which
stuck a gay cluster of paper flags; a brown, polished abacus; a mace
carved with a dragon, another carved with a phoenix; a rainbow robe,
gleaming with the plumage of Siamese kingfishers.All these, and more,
he displayed aloft and replaced among the candles.When his chant ended, a brisk little man in yellow stepped forward into
the lane."O Fragrant Ones," he shrilled, "I bring ten thousand recruits, to join
our army and swear brotherhood.Behind him, a squad of some dozen barefoot wretches, in coolie clothes,
with queues un-plaited, crawled on all fours through the first arch.They crouched abject, while the tall Master of Incense in the dove-gray
silk sternly examined their sponsor.In the outer darkness, Heywood craned and listened till neck and
shoulders ached.He could make nothing of the florid verbiage.With endless ritual, the crawling novices reached the arch of swords.They knelt, each holding above his head a lighted bundle of
incense-sticks,--red sparks that quivered like angry fireflies.Above
them the tall Master of Incense thundered:--

"O Spirits of the Hills and Brooks, the Land, the swollen seeds of the
ground, and all the Veins of Earth; O Thou, young Bearer of the Axe that
cleared the Hills; O Imperial Heaven, and ye, Five Dragons of the Five
Regions, with all the Holy Influences who pass and instantly re-pass
through unutterable space:--draw near, record our oath, accept the
draught of blood."He raised at arm's length a heavy baton, which, with a flowing movement,
unrolled to the floor a bright yellow scroll thickly inscribed.From
this he read, slowly, an interminable catalogue of oaths.Heywood could
catch only the scolding sing-song of the responses:--

"If any brother shall break this, let him die beneath ten thousand
knives.""--Who violates this, shall be hurled down into the great sky.""--Let thunder from the Five Regions annihilate him."Silence followed, broken suddenly by the frenzied squawking of a fowl,
as suddenly cut short.Near the chink, Heywood heard a quick struggling
and beating.The shutter grated open, a flood of light poured out.Within reach, in that radiance, a pair of sinewy yellow hands gripped
the neck of a white cock.The wretched bird squawked once more, feebly,
flapped its wings, and clawed the air, just as a second pair of arms
reached out and sliced with a knife.The cock's head flew off upon the
tiles.Hot blood spattered on Heywood's cheek.Half blinded, but not
daring to move, he saw the knife withdrawn, and a huge goblet held out
to catch the flow.Then arms, goblet, and convulsive wings jerked out of
sight, and the shutter slid home."Twice they've not seen me," thought Heywood.It was darker, here, than
he had hoped.He rose more boldly to the peep-hole.Under the arch of swords, the new recruits, now standing upright,
stretched one by one their wrists over the goblet.The Incense Master
pricked each yellow arm, to mingle human blood with the blood of the
white cock; then, from a brazen vessel, filled the goblet to the brim.It passed from hand to hand, like a loving-cup.Each novice raised it,
chanted some formula, and drank.Suddenly, in the pale face of the black image seated before the shrine,
the eyes turned, scanning the company with a cold contempt.The voice, level and ironic, was that of Fang, the Sword-Pen:--

"O Fragrant Ones, when shall the foreign monsters perish like this
cock?"A man in black, with a red wand, bowed and answered harshly:--

"The time, Great Elder Brother, draws at hand.""The hour," replied the Red Wand, "shall be when the Black Dog barks."Heywood pressed his ear against the chink, and listened, his five senses
fused into one.No answer came, but presently a rapid, steady clicking, strangely
familiar and commonplace.The Red Wand stood by the
abacus, rattling the brown beads with flying fingers, like a shroff.Plainly, it was no real calculation, but a ceremony before the answer.The listener clapped his ear to the crevice.Would that answer, he
wondered, be a month, a week, to-morrow?The shutter banged, the light streamed, down went Heywood against the
plaster.Thick dregs from the goblet splashed on the tiles.A head, the
flattened profile of the brisk man in yellow, leaned far out from the
little port-hole.Grunting, he shook the inverted cup, let it dangle
from his hands, stared up aimlessly at the stars, and then--to Heywood's
consternation--dropped his head to meditate, looking straight down."He sees me," thought Heywood, and held himself ready, trembling.But
the fellow made no sign, the broad squat features no change.The pose
was that of vague, comfortable thought.Yet his vision seemed to rest,
true as a plumb-line, on the hiding-place.Was he in doubt?--he could
reach down lazily, and feel.Worst of all, the greenish pallor in the eastern sky had imperceptibly
turned brighter; and now the ribbed edge of a roof, across the way,
began to glow like incandescent silver.The head and the dangling goblet were slowly pulled in, just before the
moonlight, soft and sullen through the brown haze of the heat, stole
down the wall and spread upon the tiles.But
Heywood drew a free breath: those eyes had been staring into vacancy."Now, then," he thought, and sat up to the cranny; for the rattle of the
abacus had stopped."The counting is complete," announced the Red Wand slowly, "the hours
are numbered.The day--"

Movement, shadow, or nameless instinct, made the listener glance upward
swiftly.He caught the gleam of yellow silk, the poise and downward jab,
and with a great heave of muscles went shooting down the slippery
channel of the cock's blood.A spearhead grazed his scalp, and smashed
a tile behind him.As he rolled over the edge, the spear itself whizzed
by him into the dark."The chap saw," he thought, in mid-air; "beastly clever--all the time--"

He landed on the spear-shaft, in a pile of dry rubbish, snatched up the
weapon, and ran, dimly conscious of a quiet scurrying behind and above
him, of silent men tumbling after, and doors flung violently open.He raced blindly, but whipped about the next corner, leaving the moon at
his back.Westward, somebody had told him, to the gate where
dragons met.There had been no uproar; but running his hardest down the empty
corridors of the streets, he felt that the pack was gaining.Ahead
loomed something gray, a wall, the end of a blind alley.Scale it, or
make a stand at the foot,--he debated, racing.Before the decision came,
a man popped out of the darkness.Heywood shifted his grip, drew back
the spear, but found the stranger bounding lightly alongside, and
muttering,--

"To the west-south, quick!I fool those who follow--"

Obeying, Heywood dove to the left into the black slit of an alley, while
the other fugitive pattered straight on into the seeming trap, with a
yelp of encouragement to the band who swept after.Heywood ran on, fell, rose and ran, fell again, losing
his spear.A pair of trembling hands eagerly helped him to his feet."My cozin's boy, he ron quick," said Wutzler."Dose fellows, dey not
catch him!Wutzler, ready and certain of his
ground, led the tortuous way through narrow and greasy galleries, along
the side of a wall, and at last through an unlighted gate, free of
the town.In the moonlight he stared at his companion, cackled, clapped his
thighs, and bent double in unholy convulsions."Oh, I wait zo fearful, you
kom zo fonny!"For a while he clung, shaking, to the young man's arm."My friendt, zo fonny you look!At last he regained
himself, stood quiet, and added very pointedly, "What did _yow_ lern?"Phew!--Oh, I say, what did they mean?The man became, once more, as keen as
a gossip."I do not know," The conical hat wagged sagely.He
pointed across the moonlit spaces._Schlafen Sie wohl_."The two men wrung each other's hands."Shan't forget this, Wutz.""Oh, for me--all you haf done--" The outcast turned away, shaking his
head sadly.Never did Heywood's fat water-jar glisten more welcome than when he
gained the vaulted bath-room.He ripped off his blood-stained clothes,
scrubbed the sacrificial clots from his hair, and splashed the cool
water luxuriously over his exhausted body.When at last he had thrown a
kimono about him, and wearily climbed the stairs, he was surprised to
see Rudolph, in the white-washed room ahead, pacing the floor and
ardently twisting his little moustache.As Heywood entered, he wheeled,
stared long and solemnly.He stalked forward, and with his sound left
hand grasped Heywood's right."This afternoon, you--"

"My dear boy, it's too hot."This afternoon," he persisted, with tragic voice and eyes, "this
afternoon I nearly was killed.""So was I.--Which seems to meet that."I feel--If you knew what I--My
life--"

The weary stoic in the blue kimono eyed him very coldly, then plucked
him by the sleeve.--"Come here, for a bit."Both men leaned from the window into the hot, airless night.A Chinese
rebeck wailed, monotonous and nasal.Heywood pointed at the moon, which
now hung clearly above the copper haze."The moon," replied his friend, wondering."Good.--You know, I was afraid you might just see Rudie Hackh."The rebeck wailed a long complaint before he added:--

"If I didn't like you fairly well--The point is--Good old Cynthia!That
bally orb may not see one of us to-morrow night, next week, next
quarter.'Through this same Garden, and for us in vain.'CHAPTER XII


THE WAR BOARD

"Rigmarole?"drawled Heywood, and abstained from glancing at Chantel.However, Gilly, their rigmarole _may_ mean business.On that
supposition, I made my notes urgent to you chaps."Forrester, tugging his gray moustache, and
studying the floor.Rigmarole or not, your plan is
thoroughly sound: stock one house, and if the pinch comes, fortify."Chantel drummed on Heywood's long table, and smiled quaintly, with eyes
which roved out at window, and from mast to bare mast of the few small
junks that lay moored against the distant bank.He bore himself, to-day,
like a lazy cock of the walk.The rest of the council, Nesbit, Teppich,
Sturgeon, Kempner, and the great snow-headed padre, surrounded the table
with heat-worn, thoughtful faces.When they looked up, their eyes went
straight to Heywood at the head; so that, though deferring to his
elders, the youngest man plainly presided.Chantel turned suddenly, merrily, his teeth flashing in a laugh."If we are then afraid, let us all take a jonc down the river," he
scoffed, "or the next vessel for Hongkong!"Gilly's tired, honest eyes saw only the plain statement."We can't run away from a rumor,
you know.But we should lose face no
end--horribly.""Let's come to facts," urged Heywood.To my knowledge, one pair of good rifles, mine and Sturgeon's.Ammunition--uncertain, but limited.Two revolvers: my Webley.450, and
that little thing of Nesbit's, which is not man-stopping.Every one but you, padre: fit only for spring snipe, anyway, or bamboo
partridge.Hackh has just taken over, from this house, the only real
weapons in the settlement--one dozen old Mausers, Argentine, calibre.765.My predecessor left 'em, and three cases of cartridges.I've kept
the guns oiled, and will warrant the lot sound.--Now, who'll lend me
spare coolies, and stuff for sand-bags?"Forrester looked up, with an injured air."As the
senior here, except Dr.Earle, I naturally thought the choice would be
my house."cried two or three voices from the foot of the table."It
should be--Farthest off--"

All talked at once, except Chantel, who eyed them leniently, and smiled
as at so many absurd children.Kempner--a pale, dogged man, with a
pompous white moustache which pouted and bristled while he spoke--rose
and delivered a pointless oration."Ignoring race and creed," he droned,
"we must stand together--"

Heywood balanced a pencil, twirled it, and at last took to drawing.On
the polished wood he scratched, with great pains, the effigy of a pig,
whose snout blared forth a gale of quarter-notes.he muttered; then resumed, as if no one had interrupted:
"Very good of you, Gilly.But with your permission, I see five
points.--Here's a rough sketch, made some time ago."He tossed on the table a sheet of paper.Forrester spread it, frowning,
while the others leaned across or craned over his chair."All out of whack, you see," explained the draughtsman; "but here are my
points, Gilly.One: your house lies quite inland, with four sides to
defend: the river and marsh give Rudie's but two and a fraction.Not hardly: we'd soon stop that, as you'll see, if they dare.Anyhow,--point two,--your house is all hillocks behind, and shops
roundabout: here's just one low ridge, and the rest clear field.Third:
the Portuguese built a well of sorts in the courtyard; water's deadly, I
dare say, but your place has no well whatever.And as to four,
suppose--in a sudden alarm, say, those cut off by land could run another
half-chance to reach the place by river.--By the way, the nunnery has a
bell to ring."Gilbert Forrester shoved the map along to his neighbor, and cleared his
throat."Gentlemen," he declared slowly, "you once did me the honor to say that
in--in a certain event, you would consider me as acting head.Frankly, I
confess, my plans were quite--ah!--vague.I wish to--briefly, to resign,
in favor of this young--ah--bachelor.""Don't go rotting me," complained Heywood, and his sallow cheeks turned
ruddy.And five is this: your
compound's very cramped, where the nunnery could shelter the goodly
blooming fellowship of native converts."Chantel laughed heartily, and stretched his legs at ease under the
table.[Illustration: Portuguese Nunnery:--Sketch Map.]he chuckled, preening his moustache."Your mythical
siege--it will be brief!For me, I vote no to that: no rice-Christians
filling their bellies--eating us into a surrender!"He made a pantomime
of chop-sticks.One or two nodded, approving the retort.Heywood, slightly lifting his
chin, stared at the speaker coldly, down the length of their
council-board."Our everlasting shame, then," he replied quietly."It will be
everlasting, if we leave these poor devils in the lurch, after cutting
them loose from their people.Excuse me, padre, but it's no time to
mince our words.The padre, who had looked up, looked down quickly,
musing, and smoothed his white hair with big fingers that
somewhat trembled."Besides," continued the speaker, in a tone of apology, "we'll need 'em
to man the works.Meantime, you chaps must lend coolies, eh?With rising spirits, he traced an eager finger along the map."I must
run a good strong bamboo scaffold along the inside wall, with plenty of
sand-bags ready for loopholing--specially atop the servants' quarters
and pony-shed, and in that northeast angle, where we'll throw up a
mound or platform.--What do you say?Chantel, humming a tune, reached for his helmet, and rose.He paused,
struck a match, and in an empty glass, shielding the flame against the
breeze of the punkah, lighted a cigarette."Since we have appointed our dictator," he began amiably, "we may
repose--"

From the landing, without, a coolie bawled impudently for the master of
the house.He was gone a noticeable time, but came back smiling.He held aloft a scrap of Chinese paper, scrawled on
with pencil.They wait for more
ammunition--'more shoots,' the text has it.The Hak Kau--their Black
Dog--is a bronze cannon, nine feet long, cast at Rotterdam in 1607.He
writes, 'I saw it in shed last night, but is gone to-day.Gentlemen, for a timid man, our friend does not scamp his reports.Chantel, still humming, had moved toward the door.All at once he
halted, and stared from the landward window.Cymbals clashed
somewhere below.The noise drew nearer, more brazen,
and with it a clatter of hoofs.Heywood spoke with
a slow, mischievous drawl; but he crossed the room quickly.Below, by the open gate, a gay grotesque rider reined in a piebald pony,
and leaning down, handed to the house-boy a ribbon of scarlet paper.Behind him, to the clash of cymbals, a file of men in motley robes
swaggered into position, wheeled, and formed the ragged front of a
Falstaff regiment.Overcome by the scarlet ribbon, the long-coated "boy"
bowed, just as through the gate, like a top-heavy boat swept under an
arch, came heaving an unwieldy screened chair, borne by four broad men:
not naked and glistening coolies, but "Tail-less Horses" in proud
livery.Before they could lower their shafts, Heywood ran clattering
down the stairs.Slowly, cautiously, like a little fat old woman, there clambered out
from the broadcloth box a rotund man, in flowing silks, and a conical,
tasseled hat of fine straw.He waddled down the compound path, shading
with his fan a shrewd, bland face, thoughtful, yet smooth as a babe's.The watchers in the upper room saw Heywood greet him with extreme
ceremony, and heard the murmur of "Pray you, I pray you," as with
endless bows and deprecations the two men passed from sight, within the
house.The visitor did not join the company, but
from another room, now and then, sounded his clear-pitched voice, full
of odd and courteous modulations.When at last the conference ended, and
their unmated footsteps crossed the landing, a few sentences echoed from
the stairway."That is all," declared the voice, pleasantly."The Chow Ceremonial
says, 'That man is unwise who knowingly throws away precious things.'And in the Analects we read, 'There is merit in dispatch.'"Heywood's reply was lost, except the words, "stupid people.""In every nation," agreed the placid voice.What says the
Viceroy of Hupeh: 'They see a charge of bird-shot, and think they are
tasting broiled owl.'"A safe walk, Your Excellency."The cymbals struck up, the cavalcade, headed by ragamuffin lictors with
whips, went swaying past the gate.Heywood, when he returned,
was grinning."Hates this station, I fancy, much
as we hate it.""Intimated he could beat me at chess," laughed the young man, "and will
bet me a jar of peach wine to a box of Manila cigars!"Chantel, from a derisive dumb-show near the window, had turned to waddle
solemnly down the room.At sight of Heywood's face he stopped guiltily.All the laughter was gone from the voice and the hard gray
eyes."Yesterday we humored you tin-soldier fashion, but to-day let's
put away childish things.--I like that magistrate, plainly, a damned
deal better than I like you.When you or I show one half his ability,
we're free to mock him--in my house."For the first time within the memory of any man present, the mimic
wilted."I--I did not know," he stammered, "that old man was your friend."Very
quiet, and a little flushed, he took his seat among the others.Still more quiet, Heywood appealed to the company."Part for his hard luck--stuck down, a three-year term, in this
neglected hole.Fang, the Sword-Pen, in
great favor up there.--What?The dregs of the town are all stirred
up--bottomside topside--danger point.He, in case--you know--can't give
us any help.His chief's fairly itching to
cashier him.--Spoke highly of your hospital work, padre, but said, 'Even
good deeds may be misconstrued.'--In short, gentlemen, without saying a
word, he tells us honestly in plain terms, 'Sorry, but look out for
yourselves.'"A beggar rattled his bowl of cash in the road, below; from up the river
sounded wailing cries."Did he mention," said the big padre, presently, "the case against my
man, Chok Chung?"Heywood's eyes became evasive, his words reluctant."The magistrate dodged that--that unpleasant subject.Without rising, he seemed to
grow in bulk and stature, and send his vision past the company, into
those things which are not, to confound the things which are.'He buries His workmen, but carries on
His work.'"The man spoke in a heavy, broken voice, as though it were
his body that suffered."But it comes hard to hear, from a young man, so
good a friend, after many years"--The deep-set eyes returned, and with a
sudden lustre, made a sharp survey from face to face."If I have made my
flock a remnant--aliens--rejected--tell me, what shall I do?I
have shut eyes and conscience, and never meddled, never!--not even when
money was levied for the village idols.And here's a man beaten, cast
into prison--"

He shoved both fists out on the table, and bowed his white head.But yours--and his.--To keep one, I desert the
other."We're all quite helpless," said Heywood, gently.It's a long
way to the nearest gunboat.""Tell me," repeated the other, stubbornly.At the same moment it happened that the cries came louder along the
river-bank, and that some one bounded up the stairs.All morning he had gone about his errands very
calmly, playing the man of action, in a new philosophy learned
overnight.But now he forgot to imitate his teacher, and darted in, so
headlong that all the dogs came with him, bouncing and barking."Look," he called, stumbling toward the farther window, while Flounce
the terrier and a wonk puppy ran nipping at his heels.CHAPTER XIII


THE SPARE MAN

Beyond the scant greenery of Heywood's garden--a ropy little banyan, a
low rank of glossy whampee leaves, and the dusty sage-green tops of
stunted olives--glared the river.Wide, savage sunlight lay so hot upon
it, that to aching eyes the water shone solid, like a broad road of
yellow clay.Only close at hand and by an effort of vision, appeared the
tiny, quiet lines of the irresistible flood pouring toward the sea;
there whipped into the pool of banyan shade black snippets and tails of
reflection, darting ceaselessly after each other like a shoal of
frightened minnows.But elsewhere the river lay golden, solid, and
painfully bright.Things afloat, in the slumberous procession of all
Eastern rivers, swam downward imperceptibly, now blurred, now outlined
in corrosive sharpness.The white men stood crowding along the spacious window.The dogs barked
outrageously; but at last above their din floated, as before, the high
wailing cries.A heaping cairn of round-bellied, rosy-pink earthen jars
came steering past, poled by a naked statue of new copper, who balanced
precariously on the edge of his hidden raft.No sound came from him; nor
from the funeral barge which floated next, where still figures in white
robes guarded the vermilion drapery of a bier, decked with vivid green
boughs.After the mourners' barge, at some distance, came hurrying a boat
crowded with shining yellow bodies and dull blue jackets.Long bamboo
poles plied bumping along her gunwale, sticking into the air all about
her, many and loose and incoordinate, like the ribs of an unfinished
basket.From the bow spurted a white puff of smoke.The dull report of a
musket lagged across the water.The bullet skipped like a schoolboy's pebble, ripping out little rags of
white along that surface of liquid clay.The line of fire thus revealed, revealed the mark.Untouched, a black
head bobbed vigorously in the water, some few yards before the boat.The
saffron crew, poling faster, yelled and cackled at so clean a miss,
while a coolie in the bow reloaded his matchlock.The fugitive head labored like that of a man not used to swimming, and
desperately spent.It now gave a quick twist, and showed a distorted
face, almost of the same color with the water.The mouth gaped black in a sputtering cry, then closed choking,
squirted out water, and gaped once more, to wail clearly:--

"I am Jesus Christ!"In the broad, bare daylight of the river, this lonely and sudden
blasphemy came as though a person in a dream might declare himself to a
waking audience of skeptics.The cry, sharp with forlorn hope, rang like
an appeal."Why--look," stammered Heywood.Just as he turned to elbow through his companions, and just as the cry
sounded again, the matchlock blazed from the bow.The
swimmer, who had reached the shallows, suddenly rose with an incredible
heave, like a leaping salmon, flung one bent arm up and back in the
gesture of the Laocooen, and pitched forward with a turbid splash.The
quivering darkness under the banyan blotted everything: death had
dispersed the black minnows there, in oozy wriggles of shadow; but next
moment the fish-tail stripes chased in a more lively shoal.The gleaming
potter, below his rosy cairn, stared.Heywood, after his impulse of rescue, stood very quiet.The clutching figure, bolt upright in the soaked remnant of prison
rags, had in that leap and fall shown himself for Chok Chung, the
Christian.He had sunk in mystery, to become at one forever with the
drunken cormorant-fisher.Obscene delight raged in the crowded boat, with yells and laughter, and
flourish of bamboo poles."Come away from the window," said Heywood; and then to the white-haired
doctor: "Your question's answered, padre.He
jerked his thumb back toward the river.Nonsense--Cat--and--mouse game, I tell you; those devils let
him go merely to--We'll never know--Of course!Plain as your nose--To
stand by, and never lift a hand!Look here,
why--Acquitted, then set on him--But we'll _never_ know!--Fang watching
on the spot.A calm "boy," in sky-blue gown, stood beside them, ready to speak.The
dispute paused, while they turned for his message.It was a
disappointing trifle: Mrs.Forrester waited below for her husband, to
walk home."Can't leave now," snapped Gilly."I'll be along, tell her--"

"Had she better go alone?"The other swept a fretful eye about the company."But this business begins to look urgent.--Here, somebody we can spare.You go, Hackh, there's a good chap."Chantel dropped the helmet he had caught up.Bowing stiffly, Rudolph
marched across the room and down the stairs.His face, pale at the late
spectacle, had grown red and sulky, "Can spare me, can you?--I'm the
one."Viewing himself thus, morosely, as rejected of men, he reached the
compound gate to fare no better with the woman.She stood waiting in the
shadow of the wall; and as he drew unwillingly near, the sight of
her--to his shame and quick dismay--made his heart leap in welcome.She
wore the coolest and severest white, but at her throat the same small
furbelow, every line of which he had known aboard ship, in the days of
his first exile and of his recent youth.It was now as though that youth
came flooding back to greet her.He forgot everything, except that for a few priceless
moments they would be walking side by side.She faced him with a start, never so young and beautiful as now--her
blue eyes wide, scornful, and blazing, her cheeks red and lips
trembling, like a child ready to cry."I did not want _you_" she said curtly.Pride forged the retort for him, at a blow.He explained
in the barest of terms, while she eyed him steadily, with every sign of
rising temper."I can spare you, too," she whipped out; then turned to walk away,
holding her helmet erect, in the poise of a young goddess, pert
but warlike.In two strides, however, he
had overtaken her."I am under orders," he stated grimly.Her pace gradually slackened in the growing heat; but she went forward
with her eyes fixed on the littered, sunken flags of their path.This
rankling silence seemed to him more unaccountable and deadly than all
former mischances, and left him far more alone.From the sultry tops of
bamboos, drooping like plants in an oven, an amorous multitude of
cicadas maintained the buzzing torment of steel on emery wheels, as
though the universal heat had chafed and fretted itself into a dry,
feverish utterance.Forrester looked about, quick and angry,
like one ready to choke that endless voice.But for the rest, the two
strange companions moved steadily onward.In an alley of checkered light a buffalo with a wicker nose-ring, and
heavy, sagging horns that seemed to jerk his head back in agony, heaved
toward them, ridden by a naked yellow infant in a nest-like saddle of
green fodder.Scenting with fright the disgusting presence of white
aliens, the sleep-walking monster shied, opened his eyes, and lowered
his blue muzzle as if to charge.said Rudolph, and catching the woman roughly about the
shoulders, thrust her behind him.She clutched him tightly by the
wounded arm.The buffalo stared irresolute, with evil eyes.The naked boy in the
green nest brushed a swarm of flies from his handful of sticky
sweetmeats, looked up, pounded the clumsy shoulders, and shrilled a
command.Staring doubtfully, and trembling, the buffalo swayed past, the
wrinkled armor of his gray hide plastered with dry mud as with yellow
ochre.To the slow click of hoofs, the surly monster, guided by a little
child, went swinging down the pastoral shade,--ancient yet living shapes
from a picture immemorial in art and poetry."Please," begged Rudolph, trying with his left hand to loosen her grip.For a second they stood close, their fingers interlacing.With a touch
of contempt, he found that she still trembled, and drew short breath.She tore her hand loose, as though burned.It _was_
all true, then.She caught aside her skirts angrily, and started forward in all her
former disdain.But this, after their brief alliance, was not to be
tolerated.If anybody
has a right--"

After several paces, she flashed about at him in a whirl of words:--

"All alike, every one of you!And I was fool enough to think you were
different!"The conflict in her eyes showed real, beyond suspicion.And you dare talk of rights, and
come following me here--"

"Lucky I did," retorted Rudolph, with sudden spirit; and holding out his
wounded arm, indignantly: "That scratch, if you know how it came--"

"I know, perfectly."She stared as at some crowning impudence.You came off cheaply.--I know all you said.But the one
thing I'll never understand, is where you found the courage, after he
struck you, at the club.You'll always have _that_ to admire!""After he struck"--A light broke in on Rudolph, somehow.she called, in a strangely altered voice, which brought
him up short.He explained, sulkily at first, but ending in a kind of generous rage."So I couldn't even stand up to him.And except for Maurice Heywood--Oh,
you need not frown; he's the best friend I ever had."Forrester had walked on, with the same cloudy aspect, the same
light, impatient step.He felt the greater surprise when, suddenly
turning, she raised toward him her odd, enticing, pointed face, and the
friendly mischief of her eyes.she echoed, in the same half-whisper as when she had
flattered him, that afternoon in the dusky well of the pagoda stairway.she cried, with a bewildering laugh, of
delight and pride."I hate people all prim and circumspect, and
you--You'd have flown back there straight at him, before my--before all
the others.That's why I like you so!--But you must leave that horrid,
lying fellow to me."All unaware, she had led him along the blinding white wall of the
Forrester compound, and halted in the hot shadow that lay under the
tiled gateway.As though timidly, her hand stole up and rested on
his forearm.The confined space, narrow and covered, gave to her voice a
plaintive ring."That's twice you protected me, and I hurt you.--You
_are_ different.When you
did--that, for me, yesterday, didn't it seem different and rather
splendid, and--like a book?""It seemed nonsense," replied Rudolph, sturdily.She laughed again, and at close range watched him from under consciously
drooping lashes that almost veiled a liquid brilliancy.Everywhere the
cicadas kept the heat vibrating with their strident buzz.It recalled
some other widespread mist of treble music, long ago.The trilling of
frogs, that had been, before."You dear, brave boy," she said slowly.Do you know what I'd like--Oh, there's the _amah!"_

She drew back, with an impatient gesture.Earle's waiting for me.--I hate to leave you."The stealthy brightness of her admiration changed to a slow, inscrutable
appeal.And with an
instant, bold, and tantalizing grimace, she had vanished within.*       *       *       *       *

To his homeward march, her cicadas shrilled the music of fifes.He, the
despised, the man to spare, now cocked up his helmet like fortune's
minion, dizzy with new honors.And now she, she of all the world, had spoken words which he feared and
longed to believe, and which even said still less than her searching and
mysterious look.On the top of his exultation, he reached the nunnery, and entered his
big, bare living-room, to find Heywood stretched in a wicker chair.I've asked myself to tiffin," drawled the lounger, from a
little tempest of blue smoke, tossed by the punkah."How's the fair
Bertha?--Mausers all right?And by the way, did you make that inventory
of provisions?"Rudolph faced him with a sudden conviction of guilt, of treachery to a
leader."Yes," he stammered; "I--I'll get it for you."He passed into his bedroom, caught up the written list from a table, and
for a moment stood as if dreaming.Before him the Mausers, polished and
orderly, shone in their new rack against the lime-coated wall.Though
appearing to scan them, Rudolph saw nothing but his inward confusion."After all this man did for me," he mused.What had loosed the bond,
swept away all the effects?An imp in white and red livery,
Peng, the little billiard-marker from the club, stood hurling things
violently into the outer glare.Some small but heavy object clattered on the floor.The urchin stooped,
snatched it up, and flung it hurtling clean over the garden to the
river.A boat-coolie, he
explained, had called this house bad names.Rudolph flicked a riding-whip at the
scampering legs, as the small defender of his honor bolted for
the stairs.From the road, below, a gleeful voice piped:--

"Goat-men!In the noon blaze, Peng skipped derisively, jeered at them, performed a
brief but indecorous pantomime, and then, kicking up his heels with joy,
scurried for his life."Chucked his billet," said Heywood, without surprise."Little devil, I
always thought--What's missing?"Rudolph scanned his meagre belongings, rummaged his dressing-table,
opened a wardrobe."A boat-coolie--"

But Heywood had darted to the rack of Mausers, knelt, and sprung up,
raging.Man," he cried, in a voice that made Rudolph jump,--"man,
why didn't you stop him?The side-bolts, all but two.--Young heathen,
he's crippled us: one pair of rifles left."CHAPTER XIV


OFF DUTY

The last of the sunlight streamed level through a gap in the western
ridges.It melted, with sinuous, tender shadows, the dry contour of
field and knoll, and poured over all the parching land a liquid,
undulating grace.Like the shadow of clouds on ripe corn, the red tiles
of the village roofs patched the countryside.From the distant sea had
come a breath of air, cool enough to be felt with gratitude, yet so
faint as neither to disturb the dry pulsation of myriad insect-voices,
nor to blur the square mirrors of distant rice-fields, still tropically
blue or icy with reflected clouds.Miss Drake paused on the knoll, and looked about her."This remains the same, doesn't it, for all our troubles?"she said;
then to herself, slowly, "'It is a beauteous evening, calm and free.'"Heywood made no pretense of following her look."'Dear Nun,'" he blurted; "no, how does it go again?--'dear child, that
walkest with me here--'"

The girl started down the <DW72>, with the impatience of one whose mood
is frustrated.The climate had robbed her cheeks of much color, but not,
it seemed, of all."Your fault," said Heywood, impenitent.She laughed, as though glad of this turn.Go on, please, where we left off.Heywood's smile, half earnest, half mischievous, obediently faded.Why, then, of course, I discharged Rudolph's gatekeeper, put
a trusty of my own in his place, sent out to hire a diver, and turned
all hands to hunting.'Obviously,' as Gilly would say.--We picked up two
side-bolts in the garden, by the wall, one in the mud outside, and three
the diver got in shallow water.Total recovered, six; plus two Peng had
no time for, eight.We can ill spare four guns, though; and the affair
shows they keep a beastly close watch.""Yes," said Miss Drake, absently; then drew a slow breath."Peng was the
most promising pupil we had.""He was," stated her companion, "a little, unmitigated, skipping,
orange-tawny goblin!"As they footed slowly along the winding path,
Flounce, the fox-terrier, who had scouted among strange clumps of
bamboo, now rejoined them briskly, cantering with her fore-legs
delicately stiff and joyful.Miss Drake stooped to pat her, saying:--

"Poor little dog.She rose with a sigh, to add
incongruously, "Oh, the things we dream beforehand, and then the things
that happen!"The jealous terrier scored her dusty paws down his white drill, from
knee to ankle, before he added:--

"You know how the Queen of Heaven won her divinity.""Another," said the girl, "of your heathen stories?""Rather a pretty one," he retorted."It happened in a seaport, a good
many hundred miles up the coast.A poor girl lived there, with her
mother, in a hut.One night a great gale blew, so that everybody was
anxious.Three junks were out somewhere at sea, in that storm.Her sweetheart on board, it would be in a Western
story; but these were only her friends, and kin, and townsmen, that were
at stake.So she lay there in the hut, you see, and couldn't rest.And
then it seemed to her, in the dark, that she was swimming out through
the storm, out and out, and not in the least afraid.She had become
larger, and more powerful, somehow, than the rain, or the dark, or the
whole ocean; for when she came upon the junks tossing there, she took
one in each hand, the third in her mouth, and began to swim for home.But then across the storm she heard her
mother calling in the dark, and had to open her mouth to answer."Well, then her spirit was back in the hut.But next day the two junks
came in; the third one, never.And for that dream, she was made, after
her death, the great and merciful Queen of Heaven."As Heywood ended, they were entering a pastoral village, near the town,
but hidden low under great trees, ancient and widely gnarled."You told that," said Miss Drake, "as though it had really happened.""If you believe, these things have reality; if not, they have none."His
gesture, as he repeated the native maxim, committed him to neither side."Her dream was play, compared to--some.""That," he answered, "is abominably true."The curt, significant tone made her glance at him quickly.In her dark
eyes there was no impatience, but only trouble."We do better," she said, "when we are both busy."He nodded, as though reluctantly agreeing, not so much to the words as
to the silence which followed.The evening peace, which lay on the fields and hills, had flooded even
the village streets.Without pause, without haste, the endless labor of
the day went on as quiet as a summer cloud.Meeting or overtaking,
coolies passed in single file, their bare feet slapping the enormous
flags of antique, sunken granite, their twin baskets bobbing and
creaking to the rhythm of their wincing trot.The yellow muscles rippled
strongly over straining ribs, as with serious faces, and slant eyes
intent on their path, they chanted in pairs the ageless refrain, the
call and answer which make burdens lighter:--


"O heh!--O ha?From hidden places sounded the whir of a jade-cutter's wheel, a
cobbler's rattle, or the clanging music of a forge.Yet everywhere the
slow movements, the faded, tranquil colors,--dull blue garments, dusky
red tiles, deep bronze-green foliage overhanging a vista of subdued
white and gray,--consorted with the spindling shadows and low-streaming
vesper light.Keepers of humble shops lounged in the open air with their
gossips, smoking bright pipes of the Yunnan white copper, nodding and
blinking gravely.Above them, no less courteous and placid, little
doorway shrines besought the Earth-God to lead the Giver of Wealth
within.Sometimes, where a narrow lane gaped opposite a door, small
stone lions sat grinning upon pillars, to scare away the Secret Arrow of
misfortune.But these rarely: the village seemed a happy place, favored
of the Influences.In the grateful coolness men came and went, buying,
joking, offering neighborly advice to chance-met people.A plump woman, who carried two tiny silver fish in an immense flat
basket, grinned at Miss Drake, and pointed roguishly."Her feet are bigger than my
Golden Lilies!"And laughing, she wriggled her own dusty toes, strong,
free, and perfect in modeling.An old, withered barber looked up from shaving a blue forehead, under a
tree."Their women," he growled, "are shameless, and walk everywhere!"But a stern man, bearing a palm-leaf fan and a lark in a cage, frowned
him down."She brought my son safe out of the Three Sicknesses," he declared."Mind your trade, Catcher of Lively Ones!"Then bending over the cage,
with solicitude, he began gently to fan the lark.As Heywood and the
girl paused beside him, he glanced up, and smiled gravely."I give my
pet his airing," he said; and then, quickly but quietly, "When you reach
the town, do not pass through the West Quarter.It is full of
evil-minded persons.A shrill trio of naked boys came racing and squabbling, to offer
grasshoppers for sale."We have seen no placards," replied Heywood."You will to-morrow," said the owner of the lark, calmly; and squatting,
became engrossed in poking a grasshopper between the brown, varnished
splints of the cage."Maker of Music, here is your evening rice."The two companions passed on, with Flounce timidly at heel.Now please, won't
you listen to my advice?No telling when the next ship _will_ call, but
when it does--"

"I can't run away."She spoke as one clinging to a former answer."I
must stand by my dream, such as it used to be--and even such as it is."He eyed her sadly, shook his head, and said no more.For a moment they
halted, where the path broadened on a market-place, part shade, part
luminous with golden dust.A squad of lank boys, kicking miraculously
with flat upturned soles, kept a wicker ball shining in the air, as true
and lively as a plaything on a fountain-jet.Beyond, their tiny juniors,
girls and boys knee-high, and fat tumbling babies in rainbow finery, all
hand-locked and singing, turned their circle inside out and back again,
in the dizzy graces of the "Water Wheel."Other boys, and girls still
trousered and queued like boys, played at hopscotch, in and out among
shoes that lay across the road.All traffic, even the steady trotting
coolies, fetched a lenient compass roundabout.Allow me to pass," begged a coffin-maker's man,
bent under a plank.called another, blocked by the hop-scotch.He was a
brown grass-cutter, who grinned, and fondled a smoky cloth that
buzzed--some tribe of wild bees, captured far afield.He came through safely; for at the same moment the musical "Cling-clank"
of a sweetmeat-seller's bell turned the game into a race.The way was
clear, also, for a tiny, aged collector of paper, flying the gay flag of
an "Exalted Literary Society," and plodding, between two great baskets,
on his pious rounds."Revere and spare," he piped, at intervals,--
"revere and spare the Written Word!"All the bright picture lingered with the two alien wayfarers, long after
they had passed and the sun had withdrawn from their path.In the hoary
peace of twilight,--

"What can _we_ do here?""There--I never meant
to say it.But it runs in my head all the time.I work and work, to keep
it down.Heywood watched her face, set straight before them, and now more clearly
cut in the failing light.Were there only pride in those fine and
resolute lines, it might have been a face from some splendid coin, or
medal of victory."Think, instead, of all the good--"

But at that she seemed to wince.As if there weren't dark streets and crooked children at
home!Oh, the pride and ignorance that sent me here!"She spoke quietly,
with a kind of wonder."Just blind, ignorant feelings, I took them
for--for something too great and mysterious.It's all very strange to
look back on, and try to put into words.I remember painted glass, and
solemn music--and thinking--then!--that I knew this lovely and terrible
world--and its Maker and Master."She looked down the dusky lanes,
where glowworm lanterns began to bob and wink.where you
see the days running into years!""The Dragon's a wise old beast," he ventured.She assented gravely:--

"And in those days I thought it was a dark continent--of lost souls.""There are no dark continents," declared Heywood suddenly, in a broken
voice."The heart of one man--can hold more darkness--You would never
see into it--"

"Don't!"They stood close in the dusk, and a tremor, a wave, passed through them
both."I forgot--I couldn't help"--he stammered; then, as they stumbled
forward, he regained his former tone, keen and ready."Mustn't get to
fussing about our work, must we?--Curious thing: speaking of dreams, you
know.The other night I thought you were somewhere out on board a junk,
and Flounce with you.I swam like anything, miles and miles, but
couldn't get out to you.Worked like steam, and no headway.Flounce knew
I was coming, but you didn't.She laughed, as though they had walked past some danger."And speaking of dragons," she rejoined.The man in
the story, that dipped in dragon's blood, was made invulnerable."German, wasn't he?--Pity
they didn't pop Rudie Hackh in!"Her swift upward glance might have been admiration, if she had not
said:--

"Your mind works very slowly."Again he paused, as though somewhat hurt; then answered
cheerfully: "Dare say.Thought at first you meant the
rattan-juice kind, from Sumatra."From the streets glimmered a few
lanterns, like candles in a long cave.But shunning these unfriendly
corridors, he led her roundabout, now along the walls, now through the
dim ways of an outlying hamlet.A prolonged shriek of growing fright and
anguish came slowly toward them--the cry of a wheelbarrow carrying the
great carcass of a pig, waxy white and waxy red, like an image from a
chamber of horrors.In the blue twilight, fast deepening, the most
familiar things became grotesque.A woman's voice telling stories behind
shadow pictures, and the capricious play of the black puppets on her
lighted screen, had the effect of incantation.Before the booth of a
dentist, the long strings of black teeth swayed in the lantern-glow,
rattling, like horrid necklaces of cannibals.And from a squat
den--where on a translucent placard in the dull window flickered the
words "Foreign Earth," and the guttering door-lantern hinted "As You
Like It"--there came a sweet, insidious, potent smell that seemed more
poisonous than mere opium."Let's go faster," said the girl."Somehow, the dark makes me uneasy
to-night."Skirting the town, they struck at last the open road beyond, and saw
against a fading sky the low black bulk of the nunnery, pierced with
orange squares.Past its landward wall, lanterns moved slowly, clustered
here and there by twos and threes, and dispersed.Cackling argument came
from the ditch, wherever the lantern-bearers halted; and on the face of
the wall, among elbowing shadows, shone dim strips of scarlet.Both
pillars of the gate were plastered with them.Lighting match
from match, he studied the long red scrolls, crowded with neat rows of
symbols.'The Garden of the Three Exquisites.'--Pshaw!that's a theatre notice:
enterprising manager.--Ah, more like it.Long preamble, regular
trimetrical platitudes--here we are:--

"'These Red-Bristled Ghosts teach their dupes to break the ancestral
tablets, and to worship the picture of a naked infant, which points one
finger toward heaven, another toward earth.--To each man entering the
False Religion, a pill is given which confuses and darkens the
mind.--Why they dig out babies' eyes: from one hundred pounds of Chinese
lead can be extracted seven pounds of silver, and the remaining
ninety-three pounds can be sold at the original cost.This silver can be
extracted only by the elixir of black eyes.The green eyes of barbarians
are of no use.'--Really, what follows is too--er--obscure.But here's
the close: 'Tao-tais of the villages, assemble your population.Let us hurl back these wizard-beasts beyond the oceans,
to take their place among the strange things of creation!'""And the big characters," she added, "the big characters you tried to
hide, are 'Kill' and 'Burn'?"Gray eyes and dark eyes met steadily, while the last match, reddening
the blood in his fingers, slowly burned out.CHAPTER XV


KAU FAI

At the top of the nunnery stairs, Rudolph met them with awkward
ceremony, and with that smiling air of encouragement which a nurse might
use in trying cheerfully to deceive a sick man.Heywood laughed, without
mercy, at this pious fraud."Hallo, you Red-Bristled Ghost!""We came early--straight from
our walk.Their host, carried by assault, at once became less mournful."The cook is here," he replied, "by the kitchen-sounds."Good," said his friend; and then whispering, as they followed Miss
Drake to the living-room, "I say, don't act as though you expected the
ghost of Banquo."In the bare, white loft, by candle-light, Sturgeon sat midway in some
long and wheezy tale, to which the padre and his wife listened with true
forbearance.Greetings over, the stodgy annalist continued.The story
was forgotten as soon as ended; talk languished; and even by the quaking
light of the candles, it was plain that the silence was no mere waiting
solemnity before meat, but a period of tension.Up from the road sounded a hubbub of voices, the
tramp of feet, and loud halloos.cried Sturgeon, like a man who fears the worst; and for all
his bulk, he was first at the window.A straggling file of lanterns, borne by some small army, came jogging
and crowding to a halt under the walls.Yellow faces gleamed faintly,
bare heads bobbed, and men set down burdens, grunting.Among the
vanguard an angry voice scolded in a strange tongue."_Burra suar!_" it
raged; then hailed imperiously, "_Ko hai?_"

Where the lanterns clustered brightest, an active little figure in white
waved a helmet, crying,--

"On deck!"I'm up here," called that young man.For reply, the stranger began to skip among his cohorts, jerking out his
white legs like a dancing marionette.Then, with a sudden drop-kick, he
sent the helmet flickering high into the darkness over the wall.The squabbling
retinue surged after him through the gate, and one by one the lanterns
disappeared under the covered way.All stared; for Captain Kneebone, after one historically brief and
outspoken visit, had never in all these years set foot in the port.The
two young men hurried to the stairs.Chinamen and lanterns crowded the courtyard, stuffed the passage, and
still came straggling in at the gate.By the noise and clatter, it might
have been a caravan, or a band of half-naked robbers bringing plunder.Everywhere, on the stone flags, coolies were dumping down bundles,
boxes, jute-bags crammed with heavy objects.Among them, still brawling
in bad Hindustani, the little captain gave his orders.At sight of
Heywood, however, he began once more to caper, with extravagant
grimaces.By his smooth, ruddy face, and tunic of purest white, he
seemed a runaway parson gone farther wrong than ever.he cried; and dancing up, caught Heywood's
hands and whirled him about."I was fair bursting to see ye, my boy!Though his cheeks were flushed, and eyes alarmingly bright, he was
beyond question sober.Over his head, Heywood and Rudolph exchanged an
anxious glance.but this is Hackh's house--the nunnery," said the one; and the
other added, "You're just in time for dinner."He clapped Rudolph on
the arm, and crowed:--

"Nunnery?We'll make it a bloomin' chummery!--Dinner be 'anged!What's more, I've brought the chow"--he swept the huddled boxes
with a prodigal gesture,--"lashin's o' food and drink!That's what it
is: a banquet!"He turned again to his sweating followers, and flung the head coolie a
handful of silver, crying, "_Sub-log kiswasti!_ Divide, and be off with
ye!I'll not spend it all on
_you_!"Then, pouncing on the nearest crate, he burst it open with a
ferocious kick.The choicest to be 'ad in all Saigong!Look
here"--He held up a tin and scanned the label triumphantly: "Chow de
Bruxelles, what?Never saw chow spelt with an 'x' before, did ye?Bad spellers, but good cooks, are the French."Something had happened,--evidently at
Calcutta, for the captain always picked up his vernacular where he
dropped his latest cargo; but at all events these vagaries were not the
effect of heat or loneliness.But now that the coolies had gone, Captain Kneebone's heels were busy,
staving open boxes right and left.A bottle rolled out, and smashed in a
hissing froth of champagne."Plenty more," he cried, rejoicing."That shows ye how much _I_ care!Suddenly he turned from this destruction, and facing Heywood,
began mysteriously to exult over him.'That cock won't fight,' says you.'Let it alone.'--Ho-ho!The eyes of his young friend widened in unbelief."No," he cried, with a start: "you haven't?"The captain seized both hands again, and took on--for his height--a
Roman stateliness.We'll--be-George, we'll announce it, at the banquet!First time in _my_ life: announce!"Heywood suddenly collapsed on a sack, and laughed himself into abject
silence."Awfully glad, old chap," he at last contrived to say, and again
choked.The captain looked down at the shaking body with a singular,
benign, and fatherly smile."I've known this boy a
long time," he explained to Rudolph."This matter's--We'll let you in,
presently.Lend me some coolies here, while we turn your dinner into my
banquet.With a seafaring bellow, he helped Rudolph to hail the servants'
quarters.A pair of cooks, a pair of Number Twos, and all the
"learn-pidgin" youngsters of two households came shuffling into the
court; and arriving guests found all hands broaching cargo, in a loud
confusion of orders and miscomprehension.Throughout the long, white
room, in the slow breeze of the punkah, scores of candles burned soft
and tremulous, as though the old days had returned when the brown
sisters lighted their refectory; but never had their table seen such
profusion of viands, or of talk and laughter.The Saigon stores--after
daily fare--seemed of a strange and Corinthian luxury.And his ruddy little face, beaming at the head of
the table, wore an extravagant, infectious grin.His quick blue eyes
danced with the light of some ineffable joke.He seemed a conjurer,
creating banquets for sheer mischief in the wilderness.Stick a knife
into the tin, and she 'eats 'erself!"Among all the revelers, one face alone showed melancholy.Chantel, at
the foot of the table, sat unregarded by all save Rudolph, who now and
then caught from him a look filled with gloom and suspicion.Forrester laughed and chattered, calling all
eyes toward her, and yet finding private intervals in which to dart a
sidelong shaft at her neighbor.Rudolph's ears shone coral pink; for now
again he was aboard ship, hiding a secret at once dizzy, dangerous, and
entrancing.Across the talk, the wine, the many lights, came the triumph
of seeing that other hostile face, glowering in defeat.Never before had
Chantel, and all the others, dwindled so far into such nonentity, or her
presence vibrated so near.Soon he became aware that Captain Kneebone had risen, with a face
glowing red above the candles.Even Sturgeon forgot the flood of
bounties, and looked expectantly toward their source.The captain
cleared his throat, faltered, then turning sheepish all at once,
hung his head."Be 'anged, I can't make a speech, after all," he grumbled; and
wheeling suddenly on Heywood, with a peevish air of having been
defrauded: "Aboard ship I could sit and think up no end o' flowery talk,
and now it's all gone!"It was Miss Drake who came to his
rescue."How do you manage all these nice
things?"The captain's eyes surveyed the motley collection down the length of the
bright table, then returned to her, gratefully:--

"This ain't anything.Only a little--bloomin'--"

"Impromptu," suggested Heywood.Captain Kneebone eyed them both with uncommon favor.I just 'opped about Saigong like a--jackdaw,
picking up these impromptus.But I came here all the way to break the
news proper, by word o' mouth."He faced the company, and gathering himself for the effort,--

"I'm rich," he declared."I'm da--I'm remarkable rich."Pausing for the effect, he warmed to his oratory.Sailormen as a rule are bad hands to save
money.But I've won first prize in the Derby Sweepstake Lott'ry, and the
money's safe to my credit at the H.K.and S. in Calcutta, and I'm
retired and going Home!More money than the old Kut Sing earned since
her launching--so much I was frightened, first, and lost my sleep!And
me without chick nor child, as the saying is--to go Home and live
luxurious ever after!"cried Nesbit, "lucky beggar!"And a volley of compliments went round the board.The captain
plainly took heart, and flushing still redder at so much praise and good
will, stood now at ease, chuckling."Most men," he began, when there came a lull, "most men makes a will
after they're dead.That's a shore way o' doing things!Now _I_ want to
see the effects, living.So be 'anged, here goes, right and proper.To
Miss Drake, for her hospital and kiddies, two thousand rupees."In the laughter and friendly uproar, the girl sat dazed.she whispered, wavering between amusement and
distress."I can't accept it--"

"Nonsense!"grumbled Heywood, with an angry glance."Don't spoil the
happiest evening of an old man's life.""You're right," she answered quickly; and when the plaudits ended, she
thanked the captain in a very simple, pretty speech, which made him
duck and grin,--a proud little benefactor."That ain't all," he cried gayly; then leveled a threatening finger,
like a pistol, at her neighbor."Who poked fun at me, first and last?Who always came out aboard to tell me what an old ass I was?What did I come so many hundred miles
for?To say what I always said: half-shares."The light-blue eyes, keen
with sea-cunning and the lonely sight of many far horizons, suffered an
indescribable change.There's two rich men
here to-night.It was Heywood's turn to be struck dumb."Oh, I say," he stammered at last, "it's not fair--"

"Don't spoil the happiest evening--" whispered the girl beside him.He eyed her ruefully, groaned, then springing up, went swiftly to the
head of the table and wrung the captain's brown paw, without a word
to say."Can do, can do," said Captain Kneebone, curtly."I was afraid ye might
not want to come."Then followed a whirlwind; and Teppich rose with his moustache
bristling, and the ready Nesbit jerked him down again in the opening
sentence; and everybody laughed at Heywood, who sat there so white,
with such large eyes; and the dinner going by on the wings of night, the
melancholy "boy" circled the table, all too soon, with a new silver
casket full of noble cigars from Paiacombo, Manila, and Dindigul.As the three ladies passed the foot of the table, Rudolph saw Mrs.And presently, like a prisoner going to
his judge, Chantel slipped out of the room.He was not missed; for
already the streaming candle-flames stood wreathed in blue layers, nor
was it long before the captain, mounting his chair, held a full
glass aloft."Here," he cried in triumph, "here's to every nail in the hoof--"

The glass crashed into splinters and froth.A flying stone struck the
boom of the punkah, and thumped on the table.Through the open windows,
from the road, came a wild chorus of yells, caught up and echoed by many
voices in the distance.As they slammed them home, more stones drummed on the boards and
clattered against the wall.Conches brayed somewhere, followed by an
unaccountable, sputtering fusillade as of tiny muskets, and then by a
formidable silence.While the banqueters listened in the smoky room,
there came a sullen, heavy sound, like a single stroke on a large and
very slack bass-drum."_Kau fai!_" shrilled the voices below; and then in a fainter gabble, as
though hurrying off toward the sound,--"_kau fai!_"

"The Black Dog," said Heywood, quietly.Gentlemen, we all know our
posts.Rudie, go call
Chantel.If they ask about that noise, tell
'em anything--Dragon Boat Festival beginning.Anything.--We can easily
hold this place, while the captain gets 'em out to his ship."The captain wheeled, with an injured air."Told ye, plain, I was retired.Came
the last bit in a stinking native boat, and _she's_ cleared by now.Outside, the swollen discord of shouts, thunder of gongs, and hoarse
calling of the conches came slowly nearer, extending through
the darkness.CHAPTER XVI


THE GUNWALE

Rudolph's mission began quietly, with a glimpse which he afterward
recalled as incredibly peaceful.Two of the women, at least, showed no
fear.Earle, her chin cramped on her high
bosom, while she mournfully studied his  picture-book of the
Rhine.Miss Drake, who leaned in one of the river windows, answered him,
saying rather coldly that Chantel and Mrs.Forrester had gone down to
the garden.In the court, however, he ran across Ah Pat, loitering beside a lantern.The compradore grinned, and in a tone of great unconcern called out that
the pair were not in the garden.He pointed down the
passage to the main gate, and hooked his thumb toward the right, to
indicate their course."Makee finish, makee die now," he added calmly;
"too muchee, no can."Rudolph experienced his first shock of terror, like an icy blow on the
scalp.They had gone outside before the alarm; she, Bertha, was swept
away in that tumult which came raging through the darkness.--He stood
transfixed, but only for an instant, rather by the stroke of
helplessness than by fear; and then, blindly, without plan or foresight,
darted down the covered way.The tiny flame of a pith wick, floating in
a saucer of oil, showed Heywood's gatekeeper sitting at his post, like a
gnome in the gallery of a mine.Rudolph tore away the bar, heard the
heavy gate slam shut, and found himself running down the starlit road.Not all starlight, however; a dim red glow began to flicker on the
shapes which rushed behind him in his flight.Wheeling once, he saw two
broad flames leaping high in wild and splendid rivalry,--one from
Heywood's house, one from the club.He caught also a whirling impression
of many heads and arms, far off, tiny, black, and crowded in rushing
disorder; of pale torches in the road; and of a hissing, snarling shout,
a single word, like "_Sha, sha_!"The flame at the club shot up threefold, with a crash; and a glorious
criss-cross multitude of sparks flew hissing through the treetops, like
fiery tadpoles through a net.He turned and ran on, dazzled; fell over some one who lay groaning; rose
on hands and knees, groped in the dust, and suddenly fingered thin,
rough cloth, warm and sopping.In a nausea of relief, he felt that this
was a native,--some unknown dying man, who coughed like a drunkard.Rudolph sprang up and raced again, following by habit the path which he
and she had traversed at noon.Once, with a heavy collision, he stopped
short violently in the midst of crowded men, who shouted, clung to him,
wrestling, and struck out with something sharp that ripped his tunic.He
kicked, shook them off, hammered his fists right and left, and ran free,
with a strange conviction that to-night he was invincible.Stranger
still, as the bamboo leaves now and then brushed his bare forehead, he
missed the sharp music of her cicadas.Here stood her house; she had the
briefest possible start of him, and he had run headlong the whole way;
by all the certainty of instinct, he knew that he had chosen the right
path: why, then, had he not overtaken her?If she met that band which he
had just broken through--He wavered in the darkness, and was turning
wildly to race back, when a sudden light sprang up before him in her
window.He plunged forward, in at the gate, across a plot of turf,
stumbled through the Goddess of Mercy bamboo that hedged the door, and
went falling up the dark stairs, crying aloud,--for the first time in
his life,--"Bertha!Empty rooms rang with the name, but no one answered.At last, however,
reaching the upper level, he saw by lamplight, through the open door,
two figures struggling.Just before he entered, she tore herself free
and went unsteadily across the room.Chantel, white and abject, turned
as in panic.Plainly he had not expected to see another face as white as his
own.Breathless and trembling, he spoke in a strangely little voice; but
his staring eyes lighted with a sudden and desperate resolution."Help
me with her," he begged.The woman's out of
her wits."He caught Rudolph by the arm; and standing for a moment like close
friends, the two panting rivals watched her in stupefaction.She
ransacked a great cedar chest, a table, shelves, boxes, and strewed the
contents on the floor,--silk scarfs, shining Benares brass, Chinese
silver, vivid sarongs from the Preanger regency, Kyoto cloisonne, a wild
heap of plunder from the bazaars of all the nations where Gilly's meagre
earnings had been squandered.A Cingalese box dropped and burst open,
scattering bright stones, false or precious, broadcast.She trampled
them in her blind and furious search."Come," said Chantel, and snatched at her.Every minute--"

She pushed him aside like a thing without weight or meaning, stooped
again among the gay rubbish, caught up a necklace, flung it down for
the sake of a brooch, then dropped everything and turned with blank,
dilated eyes, and the face of a child lost in a crowd."Rudolph," she whimpered, "help me.Without waiting for answer, she bent once more to sort and discard her
pitiful treasures, to pause vaguely, consider, and wring her hands.Rudolph, in his turn, caught her by the arm, but fared no better."We must humor her," whispered Chantel, and, kneeling like a peddler
among the bazaar-stuffs, spread on the floor a Java sarong, blue and
brown, painted with men and buffaloes.On this he began to heap things
pell-mell.The woman surrendered, and all at once flung her arms about Rudolph,
hiding her face, and clinging to him as if with the last of
her strength."Come, he'll bring them," she sobbed."Take me--leave
him, if he won't come--I scolded him--then the noises came, and
we ran--"

"What boat?""I have one ready and stocked," he mumbled, tugging with his teeth at
the knot in the sarong corners.We'll drop down the
river, and try it along the coast.He rose, and started for the door, slinging the bright- bundle
over his shoulder.Against the gay pattern, his
handsome pirate face shone brown and evil in the lamplight."Damn you,
I've waited long enough for your whims.The woman's arms began to drag loosely,
as if she were slipping to the floor; then suddenly, with a cry, she
turned and bolted.Run as he might, Rudolph did not overtake her till
she had caught Chantel at the gate.All three, silent, sped across
fields toward the river, through the startling shadows and dim orange
glow from distant flames.The rough ground sloped, at last, and sent them stumbling down into mud.Behind them the bank ran black and ragged against the glow; before them,
still more black, lay the river, placid, mysterious, and safe.Through
the mud they labored heavily toward a little, smoky light--a lantern
gleaming faintly on a polished gunwale, the shoulders of a man, and the
thin, slant line that was his pole.called Chantel; and the shoulders moved, the line shifted, as
the boatman answered.Chantel pitched the bundle over the lantern, and
leapt on board.Rudolph came slowly, carrying in his arms the woman,
who lay quiet and limp, clasping him in a kind of drowsy oblivion.He
felt the flutter of her lips, while she whispered in his ear strange,
breathless entreaties, a broken murmur of endearments, unheard-of, which
tempted him more than the wide, alluring darkness of the river.He lowered her slowly; and leaning against the gunwale, she still clung
to his hands.snapped their leader, from the dusk behind the
lantern.Obeying by impulse, Rudolph moved nearer the gunwale.The slippery edge,
polished by bare feet through many years, seemed the one bit of reality
in this dream, except the warmth of her hands.he asked, trying dully to rouse from a fascination."No, back to them," he answered stupidly.We can't leave--"

"You fool!"Chantel swore in one tongue, and in another cried to the
boatman--"Shove off, if they won't come!"He seized the woman roughly
and pulled her on board; but she reached out and caught Rudolph's
hand again."Come, hurry," she whispered, tugging at him.She was right, somehow; there was no power to confute her.He must come
with her, or run back, useless, into the ring of swords and flames.She
and life were in the boat; ashore, a friend cut off beyond reach, an
impossible duty, and death.His eyes, dull and fixed in the smoky
lantern-light, rested for an age on the knotted sarong.It meant
nothing; then in a flash, as though for him all light of the eyes had
concentrated in a single vision, it meant everything.The 
cloth--rudely painted in the hut of some forgotten mountaineer--held
all her treasure and her heart, the things of this world.She was beautiful--in all her fear and
disorder, still more beautiful.She went with life, departing into a
dream.This glossy gunwale, polished by bare feet, was after all the
sole reality, a shining line between life and death."Then I must die," he groaned, and wrenched his hands away from that
perilous boundary.He vaguely heard her cry out, vaguely saw Chantel rise above the lantern
and slash down at him with the lowdah's pole.The bamboo struck him,
heavy but glancing, on the head.He staggered, lost his footing, and
fell into the mud, where, as though his choice had already overtaken
him, he lay without thought or emotion, watching the dim light float off
into the darkness.From somewhere in another direction came a sharp,
continual, crackling fusillade, like the snapping of dry bamboo-joints
in a fire.The unstirring night grew heavier with the smell of burnt
gunpowder.But Rudolph, sitting in the mud, felt only that his eyes were
dry and leaden in their sockets, that there was a drumming in his ears,
and that if heat and weariness thus made an end of him, he need no
longer watch the oppressive multitude of stars, or hear the monotony of
flowing water.Without turning, he heard
a man scramble down the bank; without looking up, he felt some one pause
and stoop close.When at last, in profound apathy, he raised his eyes,
he saw against the starlight the hat, head, and shoulders of a coolie.Quite natural, he thought, that the fellow should be muttering in
German.It was only the halting, rusty fashion of the speech that
finally fretted him into listening.Rudolph dismissed him with a vague but angry motion."You cannot sit here all night," he said.Rudolph felt sharp knuckles working at his lips, and before he could
rebel, found his mouth full of sweet fiery liquid.He choked, swallowed,
and presently heard the empty bottle splash in the river.said the rescuer, and chuckled something in dispraise of
women.The rice-brandy was hot and potent; for of a sudden Rudolph found
himself afoot and awake.This man, for some strange reason, was Wutzler, a
coolie and yet a brother from the fatherland.He and his nauseous alien
brandy had restored the future.The forsaken lover was first man up the bank.he
cried, pointing to a new flare in the distance.The whole region was now
aglow like a furnace, and filled with smoke, with prolonged yells, and a
continuity of explosions that ripped the night air like tearing silk.Wutzler shuffled before him, with the trot of a
lean and exhausted laborer."I was with the men you fought, when you
ran.I followed to the house, and then here, to the river.I was glad
you did not jump on board."He glanced back, timidly, for approbation."I am a great coward, Herr Heywood told me so,--but I also stay
and help."He steered craftily among the longest and blackest shadows, now jogging
in a path, now threading the boundary of a rice-field, or waiting behind
trees; and all the time, though devious and artful as a deer-stalker,
crept toward the centre of the noise and the leaping flames.When the
quaking shadows grew thin and spare, and the lighted clearings
dangerously wide, he swerved to the right through a rolling bank of
smoke.Once Rudolph paused, with the heat of the fire on his cheeks."The nunnery is burning," he said hopelessly.His guide halted, peered shrewdly, and listened."No, they are still shooting," he answered, and limped onward, skirting
the uproar.At last, when by pale stars above the smoke and flame and sparks,
Rudolph judged that they were somewhere north of the nunnery, they came
stumbling down into a hollow encumbered with round, swollen obstacles.Like a patch of enormous melons, oil-jars lay scattered."Hide here, and wait," commanded Wutzler.And he
flitted off through the smoke.Smuggled among the oil-jars, Rudolph lay panting.Shapes of men ran
past, another empty jar rolled down beside him, and a stray bullet sang
overhead like a vibrating wire.Soon afterward, Wutzler came crawling
through the huddled pottery.The smell of rancid oil choked them, yet they could breathe without
coughing, and could rest their smarting eyes.In the midst of tumult and
combustion, the hollow lay dark as a pool.Along its rim bristled a
scrubby fringe of weeds, black against a rosy cloud.After a time, something still blacker parted the weeds.In silhouette, a
man's head, his hand grasping a staff or the muzzle of a gun, remained
there as still as though, crawling to the verge, he lay petrified in the
act of spying.CHAPTER XVII


LAMP OF HEAVEN

The white men peered from among the oil-jars, like two of the Forty
Thieves.They could detect no movement, friendly or hostile: the black
head lodged there without stirring.The watcher, whether he had seen
them or not, was in no hurry; for with chin propped among the weeds, he
held a pose at once alert and peaceful, mischievous and leisurely, as
though he were master of that hollow, and might lie all night drowsing
or waking, as the humor prompted.Wutzler pressed his face against the earth, and shivered in the stifling
heat.The uncertainty grew, with Rudolph, into an acute distress.His
legs ached and twitched, the bones of his neck were stretched as if to
break, and a corner of broken clay bored sharply between his ribs.He
felt no fear, however: only a great impatience to have the spy
begin,--rise, beckon, call to his fellows, fire his gun, hit or miss.This longing, or a flash of anger, or the rice-brandy working so nimbly
in his wits, gave him both impulse and plan."Don't move," he whispered; "wait here."And wriggling backward, inch
by inch, feet foremost among the crowded bellies of the jars, he gained
the further darkness.So far as sight would carry, the head stirred no
more than if it had been a cannon-ball planted there on the verge,
against the rosy cloud.From crawling, Rudolph rose to hands and knees,
and silently in the dust began to creep on a long circuit.Once, through
a rift in smoke, he saw a band of yellow musketeers, who crouched behind
some ragged earthwork or broken wall, loading and firing without pause
or care, chattering like outraged monkeys, and all too busy to spare a
glance behind.Their heads bobbed up and down in queer scarlet turbans
or scarfs, like the flannel nightcaps of so many diabolic invalids.Passing them unseen, he crept back toward his hollow.In spite of smoke,
he had gauged and held his circle nicely, for straight ahead lay the
man's legs.Taken thus in the rear, he still lay prone, staring down the
<DW72>, inactive; yet legs, body, and the bent arm that clutched a musket
beside him in the grass, were stiff with some curious excitement.He
seemed ready to spring up and fire.No time to lose, thought Rudolph; and rising, measured his distance with
a painful, giddy exactness.He would have counted to himself before
leaping, but his throat was too dry.He flinched a little, then shot
through the air, and landed heavily, one knee on each side, pinning the
fellow down as he grappled underneath for the throat.Almost in the same
movement he had bounded on foot again, holding both hands above his
head, as high as he could withdraw them.The body among the weeds lay
cold, revoltingly indifferent to stratagem or violence, in the same
tense attitude, which had nothing to do with life.Rudolph dropped his hands, and stood confounded by his own brutal
discourtesy.Wutzler, crawling out from the jars, scrambled joyfully
up the bank."No, no," cried Rudolph, earnestly.By the scarlet headgear, and a white symbol on the back of his jacket,
the man at their feet was one of the musketeers.He had left the
firing-line, crawled away in the dark, and found a quiet spot to die in.Wutzler doffed his coolie hat, slid out of his
jacket, tossed both down among the oil-jars, and stooping over the dead
man, began to untwist the scarlet turban.In the dim light his lean arms
and frail body, coated with black hair, gave him the look of a puny ape
robbing a sleeper.He wriggled into the dead man's jacket, wound the
blood-red cloth about his own temples, and caught up musket, ramrod,
powder-horn, and bag of bullets.--"Now I am all safe," he chuckled."Now
I can go anywhere, to-night."He shouldered arms and stood grinning as though all their troubles were
ended.We try again; come.--Not too close behind me;
and if I speak, run back."In this order they began once more to scout through the smoke.No one
met them, though distant shapes rushed athwart the gloom, yelping to
each other, and near by, legs of runners moved under a rolling cloud of
smoke as if their bodies were embedded and swept along in the
wrack:--all confused, hurried, and meaningless, like the uproar of
gongs, horns, conches, whistling bullets, crackers, and squibs that
sputtering, string upon string, flower upon rising flower of misty red
gold explosion, ripped all other noise to tatters.Where and how he followed, Rudolph never could have told; but once, as
they ran slinking through the heaviest smoke and, as it seemed, the
heart of the turmoil, he recognized the yawning rim of a clay-pit, not a
stone's throw from his own gate.It was amazing to feel that safety lay
so close; still more amazing to catch a glimpse of many coolies digging
in the pit by torchlight, peacefully, as though they had heard of no
disturbance that evening.Hardly had the picture flashed past, than he
wondered whether he had seen or imagined it, whose men they were, and
why, even at any time, they should swarm so busy, thick as ants, merely
to dig clay.He had worry enough, however, to keep in view the white cross-barred
hieroglyphic on his guide's jacket.Suddenly it vanished, and next
instant the muzzle of the gun jolted against his ribs."Run, quick," panted Wutzler, pushing him aside."To the left, into the
go-down.And with the words, he bounded
off to the right, firing his gun to confuse the chase.Rudolph obeyed, and, running at top speed, dimly understood that he had
doubled round a squad of grunting runners, whose bare feet pattered
close by him in the smoke.Before him gaped a black square, through
which he darted, to pitch head first over some fat, padded bulk.As he
rose, the rasping of rough jute against his cheek told him that he had
fallen among bales; and a familiar, musty smell, that the bales were his
own, in his own go-down, across a narrow lane from the nunnery.With
high hopes, he stumbled farther into the darkness.Once, among the
bales, he trod on a man's hand, which was silently pulled away.With no
time to think of that, he crawled and climbed over the disordered heaps,
groping toward the other door.He had nearly reached it, when torchlight
flared behind him, rushing in, and savage cries, both shrill and
guttural, rang through the stuffy warehouse.He had barely time, in the
reeling shadows, to fall on the earthen floor, and crawl under a thin
curtain of reeds to a new refuge.Into this--a cubby-hole where the compradore kept his tally-slips,
umbrella, odds and ends--the torchlight shone faintly through the reeds.Lying flat behind a roll of matting, Rudolph could see, as through the
gauze twilight of a stage scene, the tossing lights and the skipping men
who shouted back and forth, jabbing their spears or pikes down among the
bales, to probe the darkness.Before
it, in swift retreat, some one crawled past the compradore's room,
brushing the splint partition like a snake.This, as Rudolph guessed,
might be the man whose hand he had stepped on.The stitches in the curtain became beads of light.A shadowy arm heaved
up, fell with a dry, ripping sound and a vertical flash.A sword had cut
the reeds from top to bottom.Through the rent a smoking flame plunged after the sword, and after
both, a bony yellow face that gleamed with sweat.Rudolph, half wrapped
in his matting, could see the hard, glassy eyes shine cruelly in their
narrow slits; but before they lowered to meet his own, a jubilant yell
resounded in the go-down, and with a grunt, the yellow face, the
flambeau, and the sword were snatched away.He lay safe, but at the price of another man's peril.They had caught
the crawling fugitive, and now came dragging him back to the lights.Through the tattered curtain Rudolph saw him flung on the ground like an
empty sack, while his captors crowded about in a broken ring, cackling,
and prodding him with their pikes.Some jeered, some snarled, others
called him by name, with laughing epithets that rang more friendly, or
at least more jocular; but all bent toward him eagerly, and flung down
question after question, like a little band of kobolds holding an
inquisition.At some sharper cry than the rest, the fellow rose to his
knees and faced them boldly.A haggard Christian, he was being fairly
given his last chance to recant.they cried, in rage or entreaty.The kneeling captive shook his head, and made some reply, very distinct
and simple.The same sword
that had slashed the curtain now pricked his naked chest.Rudolph,
clenching his fists in a helpless longing to rush out and scatter all
these men-at-arms, had a strange sense of being transported into the
past, to watch with ghostly impotence a mediaeval tragedy.His round, honest,
oily face was anything but heroic, and wore no legendary, transfiguring
light.He seemed rather stupid than calm; yet as he mechanically wound
his queue into place once more above the shaven forehead, his fingers
moved surely and deftly.snarled the pikemen and the torch-bearers, with the
fierce gestures of men who have wasted time and patience.bawled the swordsman, beside himself.To the others, this phrase acted as a spark to powder.And several men began to rummage and overhaul the chaos of the go-down.Rudolph had given orders, that afternoon, to remove all necessary stores
to the nunnery.But from somewhere in the darkness, one rioter brought a
sack of flour, while another flung down a tin case of petroleum.The
sword had no sooner cut the sack across and punctured the tin, than a
fat villain in a loin cloth, squatting on the earthen floor, kneaded
flour and oil into a grimy batch of dough."Will you speak out and live," cried the swordsman, "or will you die?"Then, as though the option were
not in his power,--

"Die," he answered.The fat baker sprang up, and clapped on the obstinate head a shapeless
gray turban of dough.Half a dozen torches jostled for the honor of
lighting it.The Christian, crowned with sooty flames, gave a single
cry, clear above all the others.He was calling--as even Rudolph
knew--on the strange god across the sea, Saviour of the Children of the
West, not to forget his nameless and lonely servant.Rudolph groaned aloud, rose, and had parted the curtain to run out and
fall upon them all, when suddenly, close at hand and sharp in the
general din, there burst a quick volley of rifleshots.Splinters flew
from the attap walls.A torch-bearer and the man with the sword spun
half round, collided, and fell, the one across the other, like drunken
wrestlers.The survivors flung down their torches and ran, leaping and
diving over bales.On the ground, the smouldering Lamp of Heaven showed
that its wearer, rescued by a lucky bullet, lay still in a posture of
humility.Strange humility, it seemed, for one so suddenly given the
complete and profound wisdom that confirms all faith, foreign or
domestic, new or old.With a sense of all this, but no clear sense of action, Rudolph found
the side-door, opened it, closed it, and started across the lane.He
knew only that he should reach the mafoo's little gate by the pony-shed,
and step out of these dark ages into the friendly present; so that when
something from the wall blazed point-blank, and he fell flat on the
ground, he lay in utter defeat, bitterly surprised and offended.His own
friends: they might miss him once, but not twice.Instead, from the darkness above came the most welcome sound he had ever
known,--a keen, high voice, scolding.It was Heywood, somewhere on the
roof of the pony-shed.He put the question sharply, yet sounded cool and
cheerful.You waste another cartridge so, and I'll take
your gun away.Nesbit's voice clipped out some pert objection."Potted the beggar, any'ow--see for yourself--go-down's afire.""Saves us the trouble of burning it."The other voice moved away, with
a parting rebuke."No more of that, sniping and squandering.Rudolph lifted his head from the dust.answered his captain on the wall, blithely."Steady on, we'll
get you."Of all hardships, this brief delay was least bearable.Then a bight of
rope fell across Rudolph's back.He seized it, hauled taut, and planting
his feet against the wall, went up like a fish, to land gasping on a row
of sand-bags.His invisible friend clapped him on the
shoulder.Compradore has a gun for you, in the court.Report to Kneebone at the northeast corner.Danger point there:
we need a good man, so hurry.Rudolph, scrambling down from the pony-shed, ran across the compound
with his head in a whirl.Yet through all the scudding darkness and
confusion, one fact had pierced as bright as a star.On this night of
alarms, he had turned the great corner in his life.Like the pale
stranger with his crown of fire, he could finish the course.He caught his rifle from the compradore's hand, but needed no draught
from any earthly cup.Brushing through the orange trees, he made for the
northeast angle, free of all longing perplexities, purged of all vile
admiration, and fit to join his friends in clean and wholesome danger.CHAPTER XVIII


SIEGE

He never believed that they could hold the northeast corner for a
minute, so loud and unceasing was the uproar.Bullets spattered sharply
along the wall and sang overhead, mixed now and then with an
indescribable whistling and jingling.The angle was like the prow of a
ship cutting forward into a gale.Yet Rudolph climbed, rejoicing, up the
short bamboo ladder, to the platform which his coolies had built in such
haste, so long ago, that afternoon.As he stood up, in the full glow
from the burning go-down, somebody tackled him about the knees and threw
him head first on the sand-bags."How many times must I give me orders?"barked the little sea-captain."Under cover, under cover, and stay under cover, or I'll send ye below,
ye gallivanting--Oh!A
stubby finger pointed in the obscurity.and don't ye fire till
I say so!"Thus made welcome, Rudolph crawled toward a chink among the bags, ran
the muzzle of his gun into place, and lay ready for whatever might come
out of the quaking lights and darknesses beyond.Nothing came, however, except a swollen continuity of sound, a rolling
cloud of noises, thick and sullen as the smell of burnt gunpowder.It
was strange, thought Rudolph, how nothing happened from moment to
moment.No yellow bodies came charging out of the hubbub.He himself lay
there unhurt; his fellows joked, grumbled, shifted their legs on the
platform.At times the heavier, duller sound, which had been the signal
for the whole disorder,--one ponderous beat, as on a huge and very slack
bass-drum,--told that the Black Dog from Rotterdam was not far off.Yet
even then there followed no shock of round-shot battering at masonry,
but only an access of the stormy whistling and jingling."Copper cash," declared the voice of Heywood, in a lull.By the sound,
he was standing on the rungs of the ladder, with his head at the level
of the platform; also by the sound, he was enjoying himself
inordinately."What a jolly good piece of luck!Firing money at us--like you, Captain.Some unruly gang among them wouldn't wait, and forced matters.The beggars have plenty of powder, and little else.Here, in the thick of the fight, was a
light-hearted, busy commander, drawing conclusions and extracting news
from chaos."Look out for arrows," continued the speaker, as he crawled to a
loophole between Rudolph's and the captain's.Killed one convert and wounded two, there by the water gate.They can't get the elevation for you chaps here, though."And again he
added, cheerfully, "So far, at least."The little band behind the loopholes lay watching through the smoke,
listening through the noise.The Black Dog barked again, and sent a
shower of money clinking along the wall."How do you like it, Rudie?""It is terrible," answered Rudolph, honestly.Wait till their
ammunition comes; then you'll see fun."I say, Kneebone, what's your idea?Sniping all night, will it be?--or shall we get a fair chance at 'em?"The captain, a small, white, recumbent spectre, lifted his head and
appeared to sniff the smoke judicially."They get a chance at us, more like!""My opinion, the
blighters have shot and burnt themselves into a state o' mind; bloomin'
delusion o' grandeur, that's what.Wildest of 'em will rush us to-night,
once--maybe twice.We stave 'em off, say: that case, they'll settle down
to starve us, right and proper.""Wish a man
could smoke up here."Heywood laughed, and turned his head:--

"How much do you know about sieges, old chap?"Outside of school--_testudine facia,_ that sort of
thing.However," he went on cheerfully, "we shall before long"--He broke
off with a start."Gone," said Rudolph, and struggling to explain, found his late
adventure shrunk into the compass of a few words, far too small and bare
to suggest the magnitude of his decision."They went," he began, "in
a boat--"

He was saved the trouble; for suddenly Captain Kneebone cried in a voice
of keen satisfaction, "Here they come!Through a patch of firelight, down the gentle <DW72> of the field, swept
a ragged cohort of men, some bare-headed, some in their scarlet
nightcaps, as though they had escaped from bed, and all yelling.One of
the foremost, who met the captain's bullet, was carried stumbling his
own length before he sank underfoot; as the Mausers flashed from between
the sand-bags, another and another man fell to his knees or toppled
sidelong, tripping his fellows into a little knot or windrow of kicking
arms and legs; but the main wave poured on, all the faster.Among and
above them, like wreckage in that surf, tossed the shapes of
scaling-ladders and notched bamboos.Two naked men, swinging between
them a long cylinder or log, flashed through the bonfire space and on
into the dark below the wall."Look out for the pung-dong!"His friends were too busy firing into the crowded gloom below.Rudolph,
fumbling at side-bolt and pulling trigger, felt the end of a ladder bump
his forehead, saw turban and mediaeval halberd heave above him, and
without time to think of firing, dashed the muzzle of his gun at the
climber's face.The shock was solid, the halberd rang on the platform,
but the man vanished like a shade."Very neat," growled Heywood, who in the same instant, with a great
shove, managed to fling down the ladder.While he spoke, however, something hurtled over their heads and thumped
the platform.The queer log, or cylinder, lay there with a red coal
sputtering at one end, a burning fuse.Heywood snatched at it and
missed.Some one else caught up the long bulk, and springing to his
feet, swung it aloft.Firelight showed the bristling moustache of
Kempner, his long, thin arms poising a great bamboo case bound with
rings of leather or metal.He threw it out with his utmost force,
staggered as though to follow it; then, leaping back, straightened his
tall body with a jerk, flung out one arm in a gesture of surprise, no
sooner rigid than drooping; and even while he seemed inflated for
another of his speeches, turned half-round and dove into the garden and
the night.By the ending of it, he had redeemed a somewhat rancid life.Before, the angle was alive with swarming heads.As he fell, it was
empty, and the assault finished; for below, the bamboo tube burst with a
sound that shook the wall; liquid flame, the Greek fire of stink-pot
chemicals, squirted in jets that revealed a crowd torn asunder, saffron
faces contorted in shouting, and men who leapt away with clothes afire
and powder-horns bursting at their sides.Dim figures scampered off, up
the rising ground."That's over," panted Heywood."Thundering good lesson,--Here, count
noses.Sturgeon, Teppich, Padre, Captain?but
look sharp, while I go inspect.""Come down,
won't you, and help me with--you know."At the foot of the ladder, they met a man in white, with a white face in
what might be the dawn, or the pallor of the late-risen moon.He hailed them in a dry voice, and cleared his throat,
"Where is she?It was here, accordingly, while Heywood stooped over a tumbled object on
the ground, that Rudolph told her husband what Bertha Forrester had
chosen.The words came harder than before, but at last he got rid of
them.It was like telling the news of
an absent ghost to another present."This town was never a place," said Gilly, with all his former
steadiness,--"never a place to bring a woman.All three men listened to the conflict of gongs and crackers, and to the
shouting, now muffled and distant behind the knoll.All three, as it
seemed to Rudolph, had consented to ignore something vile."That's all I wanted to know," said the older man, slowly."I must get
back to my post.You didn't say, but--She made no attempt to come here?For some time again they stood as though listening, till Heywood
spoke:--

"Holding your own, are you, by the water gate?""Oh, yes," replied Forrester, rousing slightly.Heywood skipped up the ladder, to return with a rifle."And this belt--Kempner's.Poor chap, he'll never ask you to return
them.--Anything else?""No," answered Gilly, taking the dead man's weapon, and moving off into
the darkness."Except if we come to a pinch,
and need a man for some tight place, then give me first chance.I could do better, now, than--than you younger men.Oh, and Hackh;
your efforts to-night--Well, few men would have dared, and I feel
immensely grateful."He disappeared among the orange trees, leaving Rudolph to think about
such gratitude."Now, then," called Heywood, and stooped to the white bundle at their
feet.Trust old Gilly to take it
like a man.And between them the two friends carried to the nunnery a tiresome
theorist, who had acted once, and now, himself tired and limp, would
offend no more by speaking.When the dawn filled the compound with a deep blue twilight, and this in
turn grew pale, the night-long menace of noise gradually faded also,
like an orgy of evil spirits dispersing before cockcrow.To ears long
deafened, the wide stillness had the effect of another sound, never
heard before.Even when disturbed by the flutter of birds darting from
top to dense green top of the orange trees, the air seemed hushed by
some unholy constraint.Through the cool morning vapors, hot smoke from
smouldering wreckage mounted thin and straight, toward where the pale
disk of the moon dissolved in light.The convex field stood bare, except
for a few overthrown scarecrows in naked yellow or dusty blue, and for a
jagged strip of earthwork torn from the crest, over which the Black Dog
thrust his round muzzle.In a truce of empty silence, the defenders
slept by turns among the sand-bags.The day came, and dragged by without incident.The sun blazed in the
compound, swinging overhead, and slanting down through the afternoon.At
the water gate, Rudolph, Heywood, and the padre, with a few forlorn
Christians,--driven in like sheep, at the last moment,--were building
a rough screen against the arrows that had flown in darkness, and that
now lay scattered along the path.One of these a workman suddenly caught
at, and with a grunt, held up before the padre.About the shaft, wound tightly with silk thread, ran
a thin roll of Chinese paper.Earle nodded, took the arrow, and slitting with a pocket-knife,
freed and flattened out a painted scroll of complex characters.His keen
old eyes ran down the columns.His face, always cloudy now, grew darker
with perplexity.He sat
down on a pile of sacks, and spread the paper on his knee."But the
characters are so elaborate--I can't make head or tail."He beckoned Heywood, and together they scowled at the intricate and
meaningless symbols."No, see here--lower left hand."The last stroke of the brush, down in the corner, formed a loose "O.For all that, the painted lines remained a stubborn puzzle.The padre pulled out a cigar, and smoking
at top speed, spaced off each character with his thumb."They are all
alike, and yet"--He clutched his white hair with big knuckles, and
tugged; replaced his mushroom helmet; held the paper at a new focus.he said doubtfully; and at last, "Yes."For some time he read to
himself, nodding."Take only the left half of that word, and what have you?""Take," the padre ordered, "this one; left half?""The right half--might be
'rice-scoop,' But that's nonsense."Subtract this twisted character 'Lightning' from each, and we've made
the crooked straight.Here's the
sense of his message, I take it."And he read off, slowly:--

"A Hakka boat on opposite shore; a green flag and a rice-scoop hoisted
at her mast; light a fire on the water-gate steps, and she will come
quickly, day or night.--O.W.""That won't help," he said curtly.With the aid of a convert, he unbarred the ponderous gate, and ventured
out on the highest slab of the landing-steps.Across the river, to be
sure, there lay--between a local junk and a stray _papico_ from the
north--the high-nosed Hakka boat, her deck roofed with tawny
basket-work, and at her masthead a wooden rice-measure dangling below a
green rag.Aft, by the great steering-paddle, perched a man, motionless,
yet seeming to watch.Heywood turned, however, and pointed downstream to
where, at the bend of the river, a little spit of mud ran out from the
marsh.On the spit, from among tussocks, a man in a round hat sprang up
like a thin black toadstool.He waved an arm, and gave a shrill cry,
summoning help from further inland.Other hats presently came bobbing
toward him, low down among the marsh.Puffs of white spurted out from
the mud.And as Heywood dodged back through the gate, and Nesbit's rifle
answered from his little fort on the pony-shed, the distant crack of the
muskets joined with a spattering of ooze and a chipping of stone on the
river-stairs."Covered, you see," said Heywood, replacing the bar."Last resort,
perhaps, that way.Still, we may as well keep a bundle of firewood
ready here."The shots from the marsh, though trivial and scattering, were like a
signal; for all about the nunnery, from a ring of hiding-places, the
noise of last night broke out afresh.The sun lowered through a brown,
burnt haze, the night sped up from the ocean, covering the sky with
sudden darkness, in which stars appeared, many and cool, above the
torrid earth and the insensate turmoil.So, without change but from
pause to outbreak, outbreak to pause, nights and days went by in
the siege.One morning, indeed, the fragments of another blunt
arrow came to light, broken underfoot and trampled into the dust.The
paper scroll, in tatters, held only a few marks legible through dirt and
heel-prints: "Listen--work fast--many bags--watch closely."And still
nothing happened to explain the warning.That night Heywood even made a sortie, and stealing from the main gate
with four coolies, removed to the river certain relics that lay close
under the wall, and would soon become intolerable.He had returned
safely, with an ancient musket, a bag of bullets, a petroleum squirt,
and a small bundle of pole-axes, and was making his tour of the
defenses, when he stumbled over Rudolph, who knelt on the ground under
what in old days had been the chapel, and near what now was
Kempner's grave.He was not kneeling in devotion, for he took Heywood by the arm, and
made him stoop."I was coming," he said, "to find you.The first night, I saw coolies
working in the clay-pit."They're keeping such a racket outside," he muttered; and then, half to
himself: "It certainly is.Rudie, it's--it's as if poor Kempner
were--waking up."The two friends sat up, and eyed each other in the starlight.CHAPTER XIX


BROTHER MOLES

This new danger, working below in the solid earth, had thrown Rudolph
into a state of sullen resignation.What was the use now, he thought
indignantly, of all their watching and fighting?The ground, at any
moment, might heave, break, and spring up underfoot.He waited for his
friend to speak out, and put the same thought roundly into words.Instead, to his surprise, he heard something quite contrary."Now we know what
the beasts have up their sleeve.He sat thinking, a white figure in the starlight, cross-legged like a
Buddha."That's why they've all been lying doggo," he continued."And then their
bad marksmanship, with all this sniping--they don't care, you see,
whether they pot us or not.They'd rather make one clean sweep, and
'blow us at the moon.'Cheer up, Rudie: so long as they're digging,
they're not blowing.While he spoke, the din outside the walls wavered and sank, at last
giving place to a shrill, tiny interlude of insect voices.In this
diluted silence came now and then a tinkle of glass from the dark
hospital room where Miss Drake was groping among her vials."If it weren't for that," he said quietly, "I shouldn't much care.Except for the women, this would really be great larks."Then, as a
shadow flitted past the orange grove, he roused himself to hail: "Ah
Pat!Go catchee four piecee coolie-man!"The shadow passed, and after a time returned with four other
shadows.They stood waiting, till Heywood raised his head from the dust."Those noises have stopped, down there," he said to Rudolph; and rising,
gave his orders briefly.The coolies were to dig, strike into the
sappers' tunnel, and report at once: "Chop-chop.--Meantime, Rudie, let's
take a holiday.A solitary candle burned in the far corner of the inclosure, and cast
faint streamers of reflection along the wet flags, which, sluiced with
water from the well, exhaled a slight but grateful coolness.Heywood
stooped above the quivering flame, lighted a cigar, and sinking loosely
into a chair, blew the smoke upward in slow content."Nothing to do, nothing to fret about, till the
compradore reports.For a long time, lying side by side, they might have been asleep.Through the dim light on the white walls dipped and swerved the drunken
shadow of a bat, who now whirled as a flake of blackness across the
stars, now swooped and set the humbler flame reeling.The flutter of his
leathern wings, and the plash of water in the dark, where a coolie still
drenched the flags, marked the sleepy, soothing measures in a nocturne,
broken at strangely regular intervals by a shot, and the crack of a
bullet somewhere above in the deserted chambers."Queer," mused Heywood, drowsily studying his watch."The beggar puts
one shot every five minutes through the same window.--I wonder what he's
thinking about?Lying out there, firing at the Red-Bristled Ghosts.Wonder what they're all"--He put back his cigar, mumbling."Handful of
poor blackguards, all upset in their minds, and sweating round.And all
the rest tranquil as ever, eh?--the whole country jogging on the same
old way, or asleep and dreaming dreams, perhaps, same kind of dreams
they had in Marco Polo's day."The end of his cigar burned red again; and again, except for that, he
might have been asleep.Rudolph made no answer, but lay thinking.This
brief moment of rest in the cool, dim courtyard--merely to lie there
and wait--seemed precious above all other gain or knowledge.Some quiet
influence, a subtle and profound conviction, slowly was at work in him.It was patience, wonder, steady confidence,--all three, and more.He had
felt it but this once, obscurely; might die without knowing it in
clearer fashion; and yet could never lose it, or forget, or come to any
later harm.With it the stars, above the dim vagaries of the bat, were
brightly interwoven.For the present he had only to lie ready, and wait,
a single comrade in a happy army.Through a dark little door came Miss Drake, all in white, and moving
quietly, like a symbolic figure of evening, or the genius of the place.Her hair shone duskily as she bent beside the candle, and with steady
fingers tilted a vial, from which amber drops fell slowly into a glass.With dark eyes watching closely, she had the air of a young, beneficent
Medea, intent on some white magic."Aren't you coming," called Heywood, "to sit with us awhile?""Can't, thanks," she replied, without looking up.She moved away, carrying her medicines, but paused in the door, smiled
back at him as from a crypt, and said:--

"Have _you_ been hurt?""I've no time," she laughed, "for lazy able-bodied persons."And she was
gone in the darkness, to sit by her wounded men.With her went the interval of peace; for past the well-curb came another
figure, scuffing slowly toward the light.The compradore, his robes lost
in their background, appeared as an oily face and a hand beckoning with
downward sweep.The two friends rose, and followed him down the
courtyard.In passing out, they discovered the padre's wife lying
exhausted in a low chair, of which she filled half the length and all
the width.Heywood paused beside her with some friendly question, to
which Rudolph caught the answer.Her voice sounded fretful, her fan stirred weakly.I feel quite ready to suffer for the faith."Earle," said the young man, gently, "there ought to be no
need.Under the orange trees, he laid an unsteady hand on Rudolph's arm, and
halting, shook with quiet merriment.Loose earth underfoot warned them not to stumble over the new-raised
mound beside the pit, which yawned slightly blacker than the night.Kempner's grave had not been quieter.The compradore stood whispering:
they had found the tunnel empty, because, he thought, the sappers were
gone out to eat their chow."We'll see, anyway," said Heywood, stripping off his coat.He climbed
over the mound, grasped the edges, and promptly disappeared.In the long
moment which followed, the earth might have closed on him.Once, as
Rudolph bent listening over the shaft, there seemed to come a faint
momentary gleam; but no sound, and no further sign, until the head and
shoulders burrowed up again."Big enough hole down there," he reported, swinging clear, and sitting
with his feet in the shaft.Three sacks of powder stowed
already, so we're none too soon.--One sack was leaky.I struck a match,
and nearly blew myself to Casabianca.""It
gives us a plan, though.Rudie: are you game for something rather
foolhardy?Be frank, now; for if you wouldn't really enjoy it, I'll give
old Gilly Forrester his chance."said Rudolph, stung as by some perfidy.This is all ours, this part, so!"Give me half a
moment start, so that you won't jump on my head."And he went wriggling
down into the pit.An unwholesome smell of wet earth, a damp, subterranean coolness,
enveloped Rudolph as he slid down a flue of greasy clay, and stooping,
crawled into the horizontal bore of the tunnel.Large enough, perhaps,
for two or three men to pass on all fours, it ran level, roughly cut,
through earth wet with seepage from the river, but packed into a smooth
floor by many hands and bare knees.In
the small chamber of the mine, choked with the smell of stale betel, he
bumped Heywood's elbow."Some Fragrant Ones have been working here, I should say."The speaker
patted the ground with quick palms, groping.This explains old Wutz, and his broken arrow.I say, Rudie, feel
about.I saw a coil of fuse lying somewhere.--At least, I thought it
was."How's the old forearm I gave you?Equal to hauling a
sack out?Sweeping his hand in the darkness, he captured Rudolph's, and guided it
to where a powder-bag lay."Now, then, carry on," he commanded; and crawling into the tunnel,
flung back fragments of explanation as he tugged at his own load."Carry
these out--far as we dare--touch 'em off, you see, and block the
passage.We can use this hole afterward,
for listening in, if they try--"

He cut the sentence short.Their tunnel had begun to <DW72> gently
downward, with niches gouged here and there for the passing of
burden-bearers.Rudolph, toiling after, suddenly found his head
entangled between his leader's boots.An odd little squeak of
surprise followed, a strange gurgling, and a succession of rapid shocks,
as though some one were pummeling the earthen walls."Got the beggar," panted Heywood.Roll clear, Rudie,
and let us pass.Collar his legs, if you can, and shove."Squeezing past Rudolph in his niche, there struggled a convulsive bulk,
like some monstrous worm, too large for the bore, yet writhing.Bare
feet kicked him in violent rebellion, and a muscular knee jarred
squarely under his chin.He caught a pair of naked legs, and hugged
them dearly."Not too hard," called Heywood, with a breathless laugh."Poor
devil--must think he ran foul of a genie."Indeed, their prisoner had already given up the conflict, and lay under
them with limbs dissolved and quaking."Pass him along," chuckled his captor.Prodded into action, the man stirred limply, and crawled past them
toward the mine, while Heywood, at his heels, growled orders in the
vernacular with a voice of dismal ferocity.In this order they gained
the shaft, and wriggled up like ferrets into the night air.Rudolph,
standing as in a well, heard a volley of questions and a few timid
answers, before the returning legs of his comrade warned him to dodge
back into the tunnel.Again the two men crept forward on their expedition; and this time the
leader talked without lowering his voice."That chap," he declared, "was fairly chattering with fright.Coolie, it
seems, who came back to find his betel-box.The rest are all outside
eating their rice.They stumbled on their powder-sacks, caught hold, and dragged them, at
first easily down the incline, then over a short level, then arduously
up a rising grade, till the work grew heavy and hot, and breath came
hard in the stifled burrow."Far enough," said Heywood, puffing.Rudolph, however, was not only drenched with sweat, but fired by a new
spirit, a spirit of daring.He would try, down here in the bowels of the
earth, to emulate his friend."But let us reconnoitre," he objected."It will bring us to the clay-pit
where I saw them digging.Let us go out to the end, and look."By his tone, he was proud of the amendment.I say, I didn't really--I didn't _want_ poor old
Gilly down here, you know."They crawled on, with more speed but no less caution, up the strait
little gallery, which now rose between smooth, soft walls of clay.Suddenly, as the incline once more became a level, they saw a glimmering
square of dusky red, like the fluttering of a weak flame through scarlet
cloth.This, while they shuffled toward it, grew higher and broader,
until they lay prone in the very door of the hill,--a large, square-cut
portal, deeply overhung by the edge of the clay-pit, and flanked with
what seemed a bulkhead of sand-bags piled in orderly tiers.Between
shadowy mounds of loose earth flickered the light of a fire, small and
distant, round which wavered the inky silhouettes of men, and beyond
which dimly shone a yellow face or two, a yellow fist clutched full of
boiled rice like a snowball.Beyond these, in turn, gleamed other little
fires, where other coolies were squatting at their supper.Heywood's voice trembled with joyful excitement."Look,
these bags; not sand-bags at all!Wait a bit--oh, by Jove, wait a bit!"He scurried back into the hill like a great rat, returned as quickly and
swiftly, and with eager hands began to uncoil something on the clay
threshold."Do you know enough to time a fuse?""Neither do I.
Powder's bad, anyhow.Here, quick, lend me a
knife."He slashed open one of the lower sacks in the bulkhead by the
door, stuffed in some kind of twisted cord, and, edging away, sat for an
instant with his knife-blade gleaming in the ruddy twilight."How long,
Rudie, how long?""Too long, or too short, spoils
everything."Now lie across," he ordered, "and shield the tandstickor."With a
sudden fuff, the match blazed up to show his gray eyes bright and
dancing, his face glossy with sweat; below, on the golden clay, the
twisted, lumpy tail of the fuse, like the end of a dusty vine.Darkness
followed, quick and blinding.A rosy, fitful coal sputtered, darting out
short capillary lines and needles of fire.If it blows up, and caves the earth on
us--" Heywood ran on hands and knees, as if that were his natural way of
going.Rudolph scrambled after, now urged by an ecstasy of apprehension,
now clogged as by the weight of all the hill above them.If it should
fall now, he thought, or now; and thus measuring as he crawled, found
the tunnel endless.When at last, however, they gained the bottom of the shaft, and were
hoisted out among their coolies on the shelving mound, the evening
stillness lay above and about them, undisturbed.The fuse could never
have lasted all these minutes."Gone out," said Heywood, gloomily.He climbed the bamboo scaffold, and stood looking over the wall.Rudolph
perched beside him,--by the same anxious, futile instinct of curiosity,
for they could see nothing but the night and the burning stars.Underground again, Rudie, and try our first plan.""The Sword-Pen looks to set off his mine
to-morrow morning."He clutched the wall in time to save himself, as the bamboo frame leapt
underfoot.Outside, the crest of the <DW72> ran black against a single
burst of flame.The detonation came like the blow of a mallet on
the ribs.Heywood jumped to the ground, and in a
pelting shower of clods, exulted:--


"He looked again, and saw it was
The middle of next week!"He ran off, laughing, in the wide hush of astonishment.CHAPTER XX


THE HAKKA BOAT

"Pretty fair," Captain Kneebone said.This grudging praise--in which, moreover, Heywood tamely acquiesced--was
his only comment.On Rudolph it had singular effects: at first filling
him with resentment, and almost making him suspect the little captain of
jealousy; then amusing him, as chance words of no weight; but in the
unreal days that followed, recurring to convince him with all the force
of prompt and subtle fore-knowledge.It helped him to learn the cold,
salutary lesson, that one exploit does not make a victory.The springing of their countermine, he found, was no deliverance.It had
two plain results, and no more: the crest of the high field, without,
had changed its contour next morning as though a monster had bitten it;
and when the day had burnt itself out in sullen darkness, there burst on
all sides an attack of prolonged and furious exasperation.The fusillade
now came not only from the landward sides, but from a long flotilla of
boats in the river; and although these vanished at dawn, the fire never
slackened, either from above the field, or from a distant wall, newly
spotted with loopholes, beyond the ashes of the go-down.On the night
following, the boats crept closer, and suddenly both gates resounded
with the blows of battering-rams.By daylight, the nunnery walls were pitted as with small-pox; yet
the little company remained untouched, except for Teppich, whose shaven
head was trimmed still closer and redder by a bullet, and for Gilbert
Forrester, who showed--with the grave smile of a man when fates are
playful--two shots through his loose jacket.He was the only man to smile; for the others, parched by days and
sweltered by nights of battle, questioned each other with hollow eyes
and sleepy voices.One at a time, in patches of hot shade, they lay
tumbled for a moment of oblivion, their backs studded thickly with
obstinate flies like the driven heads of nails.As thickly, in the dust,
empty Mauser cartridges lay glistening."And I bought food," mourned the captain, chafing the untidy stubble on
his cheeks, and staring gloomily down at the worthless brass."I bought
chow, when all Saigong was full o' cartridges!"The sight of the spent ammunition at their feet gave them more trouble
than the swarming flies, or the heat, or the noises tearing and
splitting the heat.Even Heywood went about with a hang-dog air,
speaking few words, and those more and more surly.Once he laughed, when
at broad noonday a line of queer heads popped up from the earthwork on
the knoll, and stuck there, tilted at odd angles, as though peering
quizzically.Both his laugh, however, and his one stare of scrutiny were
filled with a savage contempt,--contempt not only for the stratagem, but
for himself, the situation, all things."Dummies--lay figures, to draw our fire.he added, wearily "we couldn't waste a shot at 'em now even if they
were real."They knew, without being told,
that they should fire no more until at close quarters in some
final rush."Only a few more rounds apiece," he continued."Our friends outside must
have run nearly as short, according to the coolie we took prisoner in
the tunnel.But they'll get more supplies, he says, in a day or two.What's worse, his Generalissimo Fang expects big reinforcement, any day,
from up country."Perhaps he's lying," said Captain Kneebone, drowsily."Wish he were," snapped Heywood."That case," grumbled the captain, "we'd better signal your Hakka boat,
and clear out."Again their hollow eyes questioned each other in discouragement.It was
plain that he had spoken their general thought; but they were all too
hot and sleepy to debate even a point of safety.Thus, in stupor or
doubt, they watched another afternoon burn low by invisible degrees,
like a great fire dying.Another breathless evening settled over all--at
first with a dusty, copper light, widespread, as though sky and land
were seen through smoked glass; another dusk, of deep, sad blue; and
when this had given place to night, another mysterious lull.Midnight drew on, and no further change had come.Prowlers, made bold by
the long silence in the nunnery, came and went under the very walls of
the compound.In the court, beside a candle, Ah Pat the compradore sat
with a bundle of halberds and a whetstone, sharpening edge after edge,
placidly, against the time when there should be no more cartridges.Heywood and Rudolph stood near the water gate, and argued with Gilbert
Forrester, who would not quit his post for either of them."But I'm not sleepy," he repeated, with perverse, irritating serenity.And that river full of their boats?--Go away."While they reasoned and wrangled, something scraped the edge of the
wall.They could barely detect a small, stealthy movement above them, as
if a man, climbing, had lifted his head over the top.Suddenly, beside
it, flared a surprising torch, rags burning greasily at the end of a
long bamboo.The smoky, dripping flame showed no man there, but only
another long bamboo, impaling what might be another ball of rags.The
two poles swayed, inclined toward each other; for one incredible instant
the ball, beside its glowing fellow, shone pale and took on human
features.Black shadows filled the eye-sockets, and gave to the face an
uncertain, cavernous look, as though it saw and pondered.How long the apparition stayed, the three men could not tell; for even
after it vanished, and the torch fell hissing in the river, they stood
below the wall, dumb and sick, knowing only that they had seen the head
of Wutzler.Heywood was the first to make a sound--a broken, hypnotic sound, without
emphasis or inflection, as though his lips were frozen, or the words
torn from him by ventriloquy."We must get the women--out of here."Afterward, when he was no longer with them, his two friends recalled
that he never spoke again that night, but came and went in a kind of
silent rage, ordering coolies by dumb-show, and carrying armful after
armful of supplies to the water gate.The word passed, or a listless, tacit understanding, that every one must
hold himself ready to go aboard so soon after daylight as the hostile
boats should leave the river."If," said Gilly to Rudolph, while they
stood thinking under the stars, "if his boat is still there, now that
he--after what we saw."At dawn they could see the ragged flotilla of sampans stealing up-river
on the early flood; but of the masts that huddled in vapors by the
farther bank, they had no certainty until sunrise, when the green rag
and the rice-measure appeared still dangling above the Hakka boat.Even then it was not certain--as Captain Kneebone sourly pointed
out--that her sailors would keep their agreement.And when he had piled,
on the river-steps, the dry wood for their signal fire, a new difficulty
rose.One of the wounded converts was up, and hobbling with a stick; but
the other would never be ferried down any stream known to man.He lay
dying, and the padre could not leave him.All the others waited, ready and anxious; but no one grumbled because
death, never punctual, now kept them waiting.The flutter of birds,
among the orange trees, gradually ceased; the sun came slanting over
the eastern wall; the gray floor of the compound turned white and
blurred through the dancing heat.A torrid westerly breeze came
fitfully, rose, died away, rose again, and made Captain Kneebone curse."Next we'll lose the ebb, too, be
'anged."Noon passed, and mid-afternoon, before the padre came out from the
courtyard, covering his white head with his ungainly helmet."We may go now," he said gravely, "in a few minutes."No more were needed, for the loose clods in the old shaft of their
counter-mine were quickly handled, and the necessary words soon uttered.Captain Kneebone had slipped out through the water gate, beforehand, and
lighted the fire on the steps.But not one of the burial party turned
his head, to watch the success or failure of their signal, so long as
the padre's resonant bass continued.When it ceased, however, they returned quickly through the little grove.The captain opened the great gate, and looked out eagerly, craning to
see through the smoke that poured into his face.The Hakka boat had, indeed, vanished from her moorings.On the bronze
current, nothing moved but three fishing-boats drifting down, with the
smoke, toward the marsh and the bend of the river, and a small junk that
toiled up against wind and tide, a cluster of naked sailors tugging and
shoving at her heavy sweep, which chafed its rigging of dry rope, and
gave out a high, complaining note like the cry of a sea-gull."She's gone," repeated Captain Kneebone.But the compradore, dragging his bundle of sharp halberds, poked an
inquisitive head out past the captain's, and peered on all sides through
the smoke, with comical thoroughness.He dodged back, grinning and
ducking amiably."Moh bettah look-see," he chuckled; "dat coolie come-back, he too muchee
waitee, b'long one piecee foolo-man."Whoever handled the Hakka boat was no fool, but by working
upstream on the opposite shore, crossing above, and dropping down with
the ebb, had craftily brought her along the shallow, so close beneath
the river-wall, that not till now did even the little captain spy her.The high prow, the mast, now bare, and her round midships roof, bright
golden-thatched with leaves of the edible bamboo, came moving quiet as
some enchanted boat in a calm.The fugitives by the gate still thought
themselves abandoned, when her beak, six feet in air, stole past them,
and her lean boatmen, prodding the river-bed with their poles, stopped
her as easily as a gondola.The yellow steersman grinned, straining at
the pivot of his gigantic paddle."Remember _you_ in my will, too!"And the grinning lowdah nodded, as though he understood.They had now only to pitch their supplies through the smoke, down on the
loose boards of her deck.Then--Rudolph and the captain kicking the
bonfire off the stairs--the whole company hurried down and safely over
her gunwale: first the two women, then the few huddling converts, the
white men next, the compradore still hugging his pole-axes, and last of
all, Heywood, still in strange apathy, with haggard face and downcast
eyes.He stumbled aboard as though drunk, his rifle askew under one arm,
and in the crook of the other, Flounce, the fox-terrier, dangling,
nervous and wide awake.He looked to neither right nor left, met nobody's eye.The rest of the
company crowded into the house amidships, and flung themselves down
wearily in the grateful dusk, where vivid paintings and mysteries of
rude carving writhed on the fir bulkheads.But Heywood, with his dog and
the captain and Rudolph, sat in the hot sun, staring down at the
ramshackle deck, through the gaps in which rose all the stinks of the
sweating hold.The boatmen climbed the high slant of the bow, planted their stout
bamboos against their shoulders, and came slowly down, head first, like
straining acrobats.As slowly, the boat began to glide past the stairs.Thus far, though the fire lay scattered in the mud, the smoke drifted
still before them and obscured their silent, headlong transaction.Now,
thinning as they dropped below the corner of the wall, it left them
naked to their enemies on the knoll.At the same instant, from the marsh
ahead, the sentinel in the round hat sprang up again, like an
instantaneous mushroom.He shouted, and waved to his fellows inland.They had no time, however, to leave the high ground; for the whole
chance of the adventure took a sudden and amazing turn.Heywood sprang out of his stupor, and stood pointing.The face of his friend, by torchlight above the
wall, had struck him dumb.Now that he spoke, his companions saw,
exposed in the field to the view of the nunnery, a white body lying on a
framework as on a bier.Near the foot stood a rough sort of windlass.Above, on the crest of the field, where a band of men had begun to
scramble at the sentinel's halloo, there sat on a white pony the
bright-robed figure of the tall fanatic, Fang the Sword-Pen.Heywood's hands opened and shut rapidly, like things out of
control."Oh, Wutz, how did they--Saint Somebody--the martyrdom--
Poussin's picture in the Vatican.--I can't stand this, you chaps!"He snatched blindly at his gun, caught instead one of the compradore's
halberds, and without pause or warning, jumped out into the shallow
water.He ran splashing toward the bank, turned, and seemed to waver,
staring with wild eyes at the strange Tudor weapon in his hand.Then
shaking it savagely,--

"This will do!"He wheeled again, staggered to his feet on dry ground, and ran swiftly
along the eastern wall, up the rising field, straight toward his mark.Of the men on the knoll, a few fired and missed, the others, neutrals to
their will, stood fixed in wonder.Four or five, as the runner neared,
sprang out to intercept, but flew apart like ninepins.The watchers in
the boat saw the halberd flash high in the late afternoon sun, the
frightened pony swerve, and his rider go down with the one sweep of that
Homeric blow.The last they saw of Heywood, he went leaping from sight over the
crest, that swarmed with figures racing and stumbling after.The unheeded sentinel in the marsh fled, losing his great hat, as the
boat drifted round the point into midstream.CHAPTER XXI


THE DRAGON'S SHADOW

The lowdah would have set his dirty sails without delay, for the fair
wind was already drooping; but at the first motion he found himself
deposed, and a usurper in command, at the big steering-paddle.Captain
Kneebone, his cheeks white and suddenly old beneath the untidy stubble
of his beard, had taken charge.In momentary danger of being cut off
downstream, or overtaken from above, he kept the boat waiting along the
oozy shore.Puckering his eyes, he watched now the land, and now the
river, silent, furtive, and keenly perplexed, his head on a swivel, as
though he steered by some nightmare chart, or expected some instant and
transforming sight.Not until the sun touched the western hills, and long shadows from the
bank stole out and turned the stream from bright copper to vague
iron-gray, did he give over his watch.He left the tiller, with a
hopeless fling of the arm."Do as ye please," he growled, and cast himself down on deck by the
thatched house."Go on.--I'll never see _him_ again.--The heat, and
all--By the head, he was--Go on.He sat looking straight before him, with dull eyes that never moved;
nor did he stir at the dry rustle and scrape of the matting sail, slowly
hoisted above him.The quaggy banks, now darkening, slid more rapidly
astern; while the steersman and his mates in the high bow invoked the
wind with alternate chant, plaintive, mysterious, and half musical:--


"Ay-ly-chy-ly
Ah-ha-aah!"To the listeners, huddled in silence, the familiar cry became a long,
monotonous accompaniment to sad thoughts.Through the rhythm, presently,
broke a sound of small-arms,--a few shots, quick but softened by
distance, from far inland.The captain stirred, listened, dropped his head, and sat like stone.To
Rudolph, near him, the brief disturbance called up another evening--his
first on this same river, when from the grassy brink, above, he had
first heard of his friend.Now, at the same place, and by the same
light, they had heard the last.It was intolerable: he turned his back
on the captain.Inside, in the gloom of the painted cabin, the padre's
wife began suddenly to cry.After a time, the deep voice of her husband,
speaking very low, and to her alone, became dimly audible:--

"'All this is come upon us; yet have we not--Our heart is not turned
back, neither have our steps declined--Though thou hast sore broken us
in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.'"The little captain groaned, and rolled aside from the doorway."All very fine," he muttered, his head wrapped in his arms."But that's
no good to me.Whether she heard him, or by chance, Miss Drake came quietly from
within, and found a place between him and the gunwale.He did not rouse;
she neither glanced nor spoke, but leaned against the ribs of
smooth-worn fir, as though calmly waiting.When at last he looked up, to see her face and posture, he gave an angry
start."And I thought," he blurted, "be 'anged if sometimes I didn't think you
liked him!"Her dark eyes met the captain's with a great and steadfast clearness."No," she whispered; "it was more than that."The captain sat bolt upright, but no longer in condemnation.For a long
time he watched her, marveling; and when finally he spoke, his sharp,
domineering voice was lowered, almost gentle.I never
meant--Don't ye mind a rough old beggar, that don't know that hasn't one
thing more between him and the grave.And that,
now--I wish't was at the bottom o' this bloomin' river!"They said no more, but rested side by side, like old friends joined
closer by new grief.Flounce, the terrier, snuffing disconsolately about
the deck, and scratching the boards in her zeal to explore the shallow
hold, at last grew weary, and came to snuggle down between the two
silent companions.Not till then did the girl turn aside her face, as
though studying the shore, which now melted in a soft, half-liquid band
as black as coal-tar, above the luminous indigo of the river.Suddenly Rudolph got upon his feet, and craning outboard from gunwale
and thatched eaves, looked steadily forward into the dusk.A chatter of
angry voices came stealing up, in the pauses of the wind.He watched and
listened, then quickly drew in his head.Two or three of the voices hailed together, raucously.The steersman,
leaning on the loom of his paddle, made neither stir nor answer.They
hailed again, this time close aboard, and as it seemed, in rage.Glancing contemptuously to starboard, the lowdah made some negligent
reply, about a cargo of human hair.His indifference appeared so real,
that for a moment Rudolph suspected him: perhaps he had been bought
over, and this meeting arranged.The
voices began to drop astern, and to come in louder confusion with
the breeze.But at this point Flounce, the terrier, spoiled all by whipping up
beside the lowdah, and furiously barking.Hers was no pariah's yelp: she
barked with spirit, in the King's English.For answer, there came a shout, a sharp report, and a bullet that ripped
through the matting sail.The steersman ducked, but clung bravely to his
paddle.Men tumbled out from the cabin, rifles in hand, to join Rudolph
and the captain.Astern, dangerously near, they saw the hostile craft, small, but listed
heavily with crowding ruffians, packed so close that their great wicker
hats hung along the gunwale to save room, and shone dim in the obscurity
like golden shields of vikings.A squat, burly fellow, shouting, jammed
the yulow hard to bring her about."Save your fire," called Captain Kneebone.As he spoke, however, an active form bounced up beside the squat man at
the sweep,--a plump, muscular little barefoot woman in blue.She tore
the fellow's hands away, and took command, keeping the boat's nose
pointed up-river, and squalling ferocious orders to all on board.This small, nimble, capable creature
could be no one but Mrs.Wu, their friend and gossip of that morning,
long ago....

The squat man gave an angry shout, and turned on her to wrest away the
handle.With great violence, yet with a
neat economy of motion, the Pretty Lily took one hand from her tiller,
long enough to topple him overboard with a sounding splash.Her passengers, at so prompt and visual a joke, burst into shrill,
cackling laughter.Yet more shrill, before their mood could alter, the
Pretty Lily scourged them with the tongue of a humorous woman.She held
her course, moreover; the two boats drifted so quickly apart that when
she turned, to fling a comic farewell after the white men, they could no
more than descry her face, alert and comely, and the whiteness of her
teeth.Her laughing cry still rang, the overthrown leader still
floundered in the water, when the picture blurred and vanished.Down the
wind came her words, high, voluble, quelling all further mutiny aboard
that craft of hers.The tall padre eyed Rudolph with sudden interest,
and laid his big hand on the young man's shoulder."No," answered Rudolph, and shook his head, sadly."We owe that to--some
one else."Later, while they drifted down to meet the sea and the night, he told
the story, to which all listened with profound attention, wondering at
the turns of fortune, and at this last service, rendered by a friend
they should see no more.They murmured awhile, by twos and threes huddled in corners; then lay
silent, exhausted in body and spirit.The river melted with the shore
into a common blackness, faintly hovered over by the hot, brown, sullen
evening.Unchallenged, the Hakka boat flitted past the lights of a
war-junk, so close that the curved lantern-ribs flickered thin and sharp
against a smoky gleam, and tawny faces wavered, thick of lip and stolid
of eye, round the supper fire.A greasy, bitter smell of cooking floated
after.Then no change or break in the darkness, except a dim lantern or
two creeping low in a sampan, with a fragment of talk from unseen
passers; until, as the stars multiplied overhead, the night of the land
rolled heavily astern and away from another, wider night, the stink of
the marshes failed, and by a blind sense of greater buoyancy and
sea-room, the voyagers knew that they had gained the roadstead.Ahead,
far off and lustrous, a new field of stars hung scarce higher than
their gunwale, above the rim of the world.The lowdah showed no light; and presently none was needed, for--as the
shallows gave place to deeps--the ocean boiled with the hoary,
green-gold magic of phosphorus, that heaved alongside in soft explosions
of witch-fire, and sent uncertain smoky tremors playing through the
darkness on deck.Rudolph, watching this tropic miracle, could make out
the white figure of the captain, asleep near by, under the faint
semicircle of the deck-house; and across from him, Miss Drake, still
sitting upright, as though waiting, with Flounce at her side.Landward,
against the last sage-green vapor of daylight, ran the dim range of the
hills, in long undulations broken by sharper crests, like the finny back
of leviathan basking.Over there, thought Rudolph, beyond that black shape as beyond its
guarding dragon, lay the whole mysterious and peaceful empire, with
uncounted lives going on, ending, beginning, as though he, and his sore
loss, and his heart vacant of all but grief, belonged to some
unheard-of, alien process, to Nature's most unworthy trifling.This
boatload of men and women--so huge a part of his own experience--was
like the tiniest barnacle chafed from the side of that dark,
serene monster.Rudolph stared long at the hills, and as they faded, hung his head.From that dragon he had learned much; yet now all learning was but loss.Of a sudden the girl spoke, in a clear yet guarded voice, too low to
reach the sleepers.It will be good for
both of us."Rudolph crossed silently, and stood leaning on the gunwale beside her."I thought only," he answered, "how much the hills looked so--as a
dragon."The trembling phosphorus half-revealed her face, pale and
still."I was thinking of that, in a way.It reminded me of what he
said, once--when we were walking together."To their great relief, they found themselves talking of Heywood, sadly,
but freely, and as it were in a sudden calm.Their friendship seemed,
for the moment, a thing as long established as the dragon hills.Years
afterward, Rudolph recalled her words, plainer than the fiery wonder
that spread and burst round their little vessel, or the long play of
heat-lightning which now, from time to time, wavered instantly along the
eastern sea-line."To go on with life, even when we
are alone--You will go on, I know.And again she said: "Yes,
such men as he are--a sort of Happy Warrior."And later, in her slow and
level voice: "You learned something, you say.Isn't that--what I
call--being invulnerable?When a man's greater than anything that
happens to him--"

So they talked, their speech bare and simple, but the pauses and longer
silences filled with deep understanding, solemnized by the time and the
place, as though their two lonely spirits caught wisdom from the night,
scope from the silent ocean, light from the flickering East.The flashes, meanwhile, came faster and prolonged their glory, running
behind a thin, dead screen of scalloped clouds, piercing the tropic sky
with summer blue, and ripping out the lost horizon like a long black
fibre from pulp.The two friends watched in silence, when Rudolph rose,
and moved cautiously aft.So long as the boiling witch-fire
turned their wake to golden vapor, he could not be sure; but whenever
the heat-lightning ran, and through the sere, phantasmal sail, the
lookout in the bow flashed like a sharp silhouette through wire
gauze,--then it seemed to Rudolph that another small black shape leapt
out astern, and vanished.He stood by the lowdah, watching anxiously.Time and again the ocean flickered into view, like the floor of a
measureless cavern; and still he could not tell.But at last the lowdah
also turned his head, and murmured.Their boat creaked monotonously,
drifting to leeward in a riot of golden mist; yet now another creaking
disturbed the night, in a different cadence.Another boat followed them,
rowing fast and gaining.In a brighter flash, her black sail fluttered,
unmistakable.Rudolph reached for his gun, but waited silently.Some chance fisherman, it might be, or any small craft holding the same
course along the coast.Still, he did not like the hurry of the sweeps,
which presently groaned louder and threw up nebulous fire.The
stranger's bow became an arrowhead of running gold.And here was Flounce, ready to misbehave once more.Before he could
catch her, the small white body of the terrier whipped by him, and past
the steersman.This time, however, as though cowed, she began to
whimper, and then maintained a long, trembling whine.Beside Rudolph, the compradore's head bobbed up.And in his native tongue, Ah Pat grumbled
something about ghosts.A harsh voice hailed, from the boat astern; the lowdah answered; and so
rapidly slid the deceptive glimmer of her bow, that before Rudolph knew
whether to wake his friends, or could recover, next, from the shock and
ecstasy of unbelief, a tall white figure jumped or swarmed over
the side.sounded the voice of Heywood, gravely.With fingers
that dripped gold, he tried to pat the bounding terrier.She flew up at
him, and tumbled back, in the liveliest danger of falling overboard.In a daze, Rudolph gripped the wet and shining hands,
and heard the same quiet voice: "Rest all asleep, I suppose?To-morrow will do.--Have you any money on you?Toss that
fisherman--whatever you think I'm worth.He really rowed like steam,
you know."Rudolph flung his purse into the other boat.When he turned, this man
restored from the sea had disappeared.But he had only stolen forward,
dog in arms, to sit beside Miss Drake.So quietly had all happened, that
none of the sleepers, not even the captain, was aware.Rudolph drew near
the two murmuring voices.

"--Couldn't help it, honestly," said Heywood."Can't describe, or
explain.Just something--went black inside my head, you know.""No: don't recall seeing a thing, really, until I pitched away
the--what happened to be in my hands.Losing your
head, I suppose they call it.The girl's question recalled him from his puzzle."I ran, that's all.--Oh,
yes, but I ran faster.--Not half so many as you'd suppose.Most of 'em
were away, burning your hospital.Hence those stuffed hats, Rudie, in the trench.--Only three
of the lot could run.I merely scuttled into the next bamboo, and kept
on scuttling.Oh, yes, arrow in the
shoulder--scratch.Of course, when it came dark, I stopped running, and
made for the nearest fisherman."But," protested Rudolph, wondering, "we heard shots.""Yes, I had my Webley in my belt.I _told_ you: three of
them could run."The speaker patted the terrier in his lap."My dream,
eh, little dog?You _were_ the only one to know.""No," said the girl: "I knew--all the time, that--"

Whatever she meant, Rudolph could only guess; but it was true, he
thought, that she had never once spoken as though the present meeting
were not possible, here or somewhere.Recalling this, he suddenly but
quietly stepped away aft, to sit beside the steersman, and smile in
the darkness.He did not listen, but watched the phosphorus
welling soft and turbulent in the wake, and far off, in glimpses of the
tropic light, the great Dragon weltering on the face of the waters.The
shape glimmered forth, died away, like a prodigy."Ich lieg' und besitze."And yet," thought the young man, "I have one pearl from his hoard."That girl was right: like Siegfried tempered in the grisly flood, the
raw boy was turning into a man, seasoned and invulnerable.Heywood was calling to him:--

"You must go Home with us.I've made a wonderful plan--with
the captain's fortune!A small white heap across the deck began to rise."How often," complained a voice blurred with sleep, "how often must I
tell ye--wake me, unless the ship--chart's all--Good God!"At the captain's cry, those who lay in darkness under the thatched roof
began to mutter, to rise, and grope out into the trembling light, with
sleepy cries of joy.Bastards o' the hure o' Babylon was the best words in their wame.Sae then the kiln was in a bleeze again, and they brought us a' three on
wi' them to mak us an example, as they ca't."said Morton, half
speaking to himself; "here is a poor peaceable fellow, whose only motive
for joining the conventicle was a sense of filial piety, and he is
chained up like a thief or murderer, and likely to die the death of one,
but without the privilege of a formal trial, which our laws indulge to
the worst malefactor!Even to witness such tyranny, and still more to
suffer under it, is enough to make the blood of the tamest slave boil
within him.""To be sure," said Cuddie, hearing, and partly understanding, what had
broken from Morton in resentment of his injuries, "it is no right to
speak evil o' dignities--my auld leddy aye said that, as nae doubt she
had a gude right to do, being in a place o' dignity hersell; and troth I
listened to her very patiently, for she aye ordered a dram, or a sowp
kale, or something to us, after she had gien us a hearing on our duties.But deil a dram, or kale, or ony thing else--no sae muckle as a cup o'
cauld water--do thae lords at Edinburgh gie us; and yet they are heading
and hanging amang us, and trailing us after thae blackguard troopers, and
taking our goods and gear as if we were outlaws.I canna say I tak it
kind at their hands.""It would be very strange if you did," answered Morton, with suppressed
emotion."And what I like warst o' a'," continued poor Cuddie, "is thae ranting
red-coats coming amang the lasses, and taking awa our joes.I had a sair
heart o' my ain when I passed the Mains down at Tillietudlem this morning
about parritch-time, and saw the reek comin' out at my ain lum-head, and
kend there was some ither body than my auld mither sitting by the
ingle-side.But I think my heart was e'en sairer, when I saw that
hellicat trooper, Tam Halliday, kissing Jenny Dennison afore my face.I
wonder women can hae the impudence to do sic things; but they are a' for
the red-coats.Whiles I hae thought o' being a trooper mysell, when I
thought naething else wad gae down wi' Jenny--and yet I'll no blame her
ower muckle neither, for maybe it was a' for my sake that she loot Tam
touzle her tap-knots that gate."said Morton, unable to refrain from taking some interest
in a story which seemed to bear a singular coincidence with his own."E'en sae, Milnwood," replied Cuddie; "for the puir quean gat leave to
come near me wi' speaking the loun fair, (d--n him, that I suld say sae!)and sae she bade me God speed, and she wanted to stap siller into my
hand;--I'se warrant it was the tae half o' her fee and bountith, for she
wared the ither half on pinners and pearlings to gang to see us shoot yon
day at the popinjay.""And did you take it, Cuddie?""Troth did I no, Milnwood; I was sic a fule as to fling it back to
her--my heart was ower grit to be behadden to her, when I had seen that
loon slavering and kissing at her.But I was a great fule for my pains;
it wad hae dune my mither and me some gude, and she'll ware't a' on duds
and nonsense."Cuddie was probably engaged in
regretting the rejection of his mistress's bounty, and Henry Morton in
considering from what motives, or upon what conditions, Miss Bellenden
had succeeded in procuring the interference of Lord Evandale in his
favour.Was it not possible, suggested his awakening hopes, that he had construed
her influence over Lord Evandale hastily and unjustly?Ought he to
censure her severely, if, submitting to dissimulation for his sake, she
had permitted the young nobleman to entertain hopes which she had no
intention to realize?Or what if she had appealed to the generosity which
Lord Evandale was supposed to possess, and had engaged his honour to
protect the person of a favoured rival?Still, however, the words which he had overheard recurred ever and anon
to his remembrance, with a pang which resembled the sting of an adder."Nothing that she could refuse him!--was it possible to make a more
unlimited declaration of predilection?The language of affection has not,
within the limits of maidenly delicacy, a stronger expression.She is
lost to me wholly, and for ever; and nothing remains for me now, but
vengeance for my own wrongs, and for those which are hourly inflicted on
my country."Apparently, Cuddie, though with less refinement, was following out a
similar train of ideas; for he suddenly asked Morton in a low
whisper--"Wad there be ony ill in getting out o' thae chields' hands an
ane could compass it?""None in the world," said Morton; "and if an opportunity occurs of doing
so, depend on it I for one will not let it slip.""I'm blythe to hear ye say sae," answered Cuddie."I'm but a puir silly
fallow, but I canna think there wad be muckle ill in breaking out by
strength o' hand, if ye could mak it ony thing feasible.I am the lad
that will ne'er fear to lay on, if it were come to that; but our auld
leddy wad hae ca'd that a resisting o' the king's authority.""I will resist any authority on earth," said Morton, "that invades
tyrannically my chartered rights as a freeman; and I am determined I will
not be unjustly dragged to a jail, or perhaps a gibbet, if I can possibly
make my escape from these men either by address or force.""Weel, that's just my mind too, aye supposing we hae a feasible
opportunity o' breaking loose.But then ye speak o' a charter; now these
are things that only belang to the like o' you that are a gentleman, and
it mightna bear me through that am but a husbandman.""The charter that I speak of," said Morton, "is common to the meanest
Scotchman.It is that freedom from stripes and bondage which was claimed,
as you may read in Scripture, by the Apostle Paul himself, and which
every man who is free-born is called upon to defend, for his own sake and
that of his countrymen."replied Cuddie, "it wad hae been lang or my Leddy Margaret,
or my mither either, wad hae fund out sic a wiselike doctrine in the
Bible!The tane was aye graning about giving tribute to Caesar, and the
tither is as daft wi' her whiggery.I hae been clean spoilt, just wi'
listening to twa blethering auld wives; but if I could get a gentleman
that wad let me tak on to be his servant, I am confident I wad be a clean
contrary creature; and I hope your honour will think on what I am saying,
if ye were ance fairly delivered out o' this house of bondage, and just
take me to be your ain wally-de-shamble."that would be sorry
preferment, even if we were at liberty.""I ken what ye're thinking--that because I am landward-bred, I wad be
bringing ye to disgrace afore folk; but ye maun ken I'm gay gleg at the
uptak; there was never ony thing dune wi' hand but I learned gay readily,
'septing reading, writing, and ciphering; but there's no the like o' me
at the fit-ba', and I can play wi' the broadsword as weel as Corporal
Inglis there.I hae broken his head or now, for as massy as he's riding
ahint us.--And then ye'll no be gaun to stay in this country?"--said he,
stopping and interrupting himself."Weel, I carena a boddle.Ye see I wad get my mither bestowed wi' her
auld graning tittie, auntie Meg, in the Gallowgate o' Glasgow, and then I
trust they wad neither burn her for a witch, or let her fail for fau't o'
fude, or hang her up for an auld whig wife; for the provost, they say, is
very regardfu' o' sic puir bodies.And then you and me wad gang and pouss
our fortunes, like the folk i' the daft auld tales about Jock the
Giant-killer and Valentine and Orson; and we wad come back to merry
Scotland, as the sang says, and I wad tak to the stilts again, and turn
sic furs on the bonny rigs o' Milnwood holms, that it wad be worth a pint
but to look at them.""I fear," said Morton, "there is very little chance, my good friend
Cuddie, of our getting back to our old occupation.""Hout, stir--hout, stir," replied Cuddie, "it's aye gude to keep up a
hardy heart--as broken a ship's come to land.--But what's that I hear?never stir, if my auld mither isna at the preaching again!I ken the
sough o' her texts, that sound just like the wind blawing through the
spence; and there's Kettledrummle setting to wark, too--Lordsake, if the
sodgers anes get angry, they'll murder them baith, and us for company!"Their farther conversation was in fact interrupted by a blatant noise
which rose behind them, in which the voice of the preacher emitted, in
unison with that of the old woman, tones like the grumble of a bassoon
combined with the screaking of a cracked fiddle.At first, the aged pair
of sufferers had been contented to condole with each other in smothered
expressions of complaint and indignation; but the sense of their injuries
became more pungently aggravated as they communicated with each other,
and they became at length unable to suppress their ire."Woe, woe, and a threefold woe unto you, ye bloody and violent
persecutors!"exclaimed the Reverend Gabriel Kettledrummle--"Woe, and
threefold woe unto you, even to the breaking of seals, the blowing of
trumpets, and the pouring forth of vials!""Ay--ay--a black cast to a' their ill-fa'ur'd faces, and the outside o'
the loof to them at the last day!"echoed the shrill counter-tenor of
Mause, falling in like the second part of a catch."I tell you," continued the divine, "that your rankings and your
ridings--your neighings and your prancings--your bloody, barbarous,
and inhuman cruelties--your benumbing, deadening, and debauching
the conscience of poor creatures by oaths, soul-damning and
self-contradictory, have arisen from earth to Heaven like a foul and
hideous outcry of perjury for hastening the wrath to come--hugh!"And I say," cried Mause, in the same tune, and nearly at the same time,
"that wi' this auld breath o' mine, and it's sair taen down wi' the
asthmatics and this rough trot"--

"Deil gin they would gallop," said Cuddie, "wad it but gar her haud her
tongue!""--Wi' this auld and brief breath," continued Mause, "will I testify
against the backslidings, defections, defalcations, and declinings of the
land--against the grievances and the causes of wrath!""Peace, I pr'ythee--Peace, good woman," said the preacher, who had just
recovered from a violent fit of coughing, and found his own anathema
borne down by Mause's better wind; "peace, and take not the word out of
the mouth of a servant of the altar.--I say, I uplift my voice and tell
you, that before the play is played out--ay, before this very sun gaes
down, ye sall learn that neither a desperate Judas, like your prelate
Sharpe that's gane to his place; nor a sanctuary-breaking Holofernes,
like bloody-minded Claverhouse; nor an ambitious Diotrephes, like the lad
Evandale; nor a covetous and warld-following Demas, like him they ca'
Sergeant Bothwell, that makes every wife's plack and her meal-ark his
ain; neither your carabines, nor your pistols, nor your broadswords, nor
your horses, nor your saddles, bridles, surcingles, nose-bags, nor
martingales, shall resist the arrows that are whetted and the bow that is
bent against you!""That shall they never, I trow," echoed Mause; "castaways are they ilk
ane o' them--besoms of destruction, fit only to be flung into the fire
when they have sweepit the filth out o' the Temple--whips of small cords,
knotted for the chastisement of those wha like their warldly gudes and
gear better than the Cross or the Covenant, but when that wark's done,
only meet to mak latchets to the deil's brogues.""Fiend hae me," said Cuddie, addressing himself to Morton, "if I dinna
think our mither preaches as weel as the minister!--But it's a sair pity
o' his hoast, for it aye comes on just when he's at the best o't, and
that lang routing he made air this morning, is sair again him too--Deil
an I care if he wad roar her dumb, and then he wad hae't a' to answer for
himsell--It's lucky the road's rough, and the troopers are no taking
muckle tent to what they say, wi' the rattling o' the horse's feet; but
an we were anes on saft grund, we'll hear news o' a' this."Cuddie's conjecture were but too true.The words of the prisoners had not
been much attended to while drowned by the clang of horses' hoofs on a
rough and stony road; but they now entered upon the moorlands, where the
testimony of the two zealous captives lacked this saving accompaniment.And, accordingly, no sooner had their steeds begun to tread heath and
green sward, and Gabriel Kettledrummle had again raised his voice with,
"Also I uplift my voice like that of a pelican in the wilderness"--

"And I mine," had issued from Mause, "like a sparrow on the house-tops"--

When "Hollo, ho!"cried the corporal from the rear; "rein up your
tongues, the devil blister them, or I'll clap a martingale on them.""I will not peace at the commands of the profane," said Gabriel."Nor I neither," said Mause, "for the bidding of no earthly potsherd,
though it be painted as red as a brick from the Tower of Babel, and ca'
itsell a corporal.""Halliday," cried the corporal, "hast got never a gag about thee,
man?--We must stop their mouths before they talk us all dead."Ere any answer could be made, or any measure taken in consequence of the
corporal's motion, a dragoon galloped towards Sergeant Bothwell, who was
considerably a-head of the party he commanded.On hearing the orders
which he brought, Bothwell instantly rode back to the head of his party,
ordered them to close their files, to mend their pace, and to move with
silence and precaution, as they would soon be in presence of the enemy.Quantum in nobis, we've thought good
               To save the expense of Christian blood,
               And try if we, by mediation
               Of treaty, and accommodation,
               Can end the quarrel, and compose
               This bloody duel without blows.The increased pace of the party of horsemen soon took away from their
zealous captives the breath, if not the inclination, necessary for
holding forth.They had now for more than a mile got free of the
woodlands, whose broken glades had, for some time, accompanied them after
they had left the woods of Tillietudlem.A few birches and oaks still
feathered the narrow ravines, or occupied in dwarf-clusters the hollow
plains of the moor.But these were gradually disappearing; and a wide and
waste country lay before them, swelling into bare hills of dark heath,
intersected by deep gullies; being the passages by which torrents forced
their course in winter, and during summer the disproportioned channels
for diminutive rivulets that winded their puny way among heaps of stones
and gravel, the effects and tokens of their winter fury;--like so many
spendthrifts dwindled down by the consequences of former excesses and
extravagance.This desolate region seemed to extend farther than the eye
could reach, without grandeur, without even the dignity of mountain
wildness, yet striking, from the huge proportion which it seemed to bear
to such more favoured spots of the country as were adapted to
cultivation, and fitted for the support of man; and thereby impressing
irresistibly the mind of the spectator with a sense of the omnipotence of
nature, and the comparative inefficacy of the boasted means of
amelioration which man is capable of opposing to the disadvantages of
climate and soil.It is a remarkable effect of such extensive wastes, that they impose an
idea of solitude even upon those who travel through them in considerable
numbers; so much is the imagination affected by the disproportion between
the desert around and the party who are traversing it.Thus the members
of a caravan of a thousand souls may feel, in the deserts of Africa or
Arabia, a sense of loneliness unknown to the individual traveller, whose
solitary course is through a thriving and cultivated country.It was not, therefore, without a peculiar feeling of emotion, that Morton
beheld, at the distance of about half a mile, the body of the cavalry to
which his escort belonged, creeping up a steep and winding path which
ascended from the more level moor into the hills.Their numbers, which
appeared formidable when they crowded through narrow roads, and seemed
multiplied by appearing partially, and at different points, among the
trees, were now apparently diminished by being exposed at once to view,
and in a landscape whose extent bore such immense proportion to the
columns of horses and men, which, showing more like a drove of black
cattle than a body of soldiers, crawled slowly along the face of the
hill, their force and their numbers seeming trifling and contemptible."Surely," said Morton to himself, "a handful of resolute men may defend
any defile in these mountains against such a small force as this is,
providing that their bravery is equal to their enthusiasm."While he made these reflections, the rapid movement of the horsemen who
guarded him, soon traversed the space which divided them from their
companions; and ere the front of Claverhouse's column had gained the brow
of the hill which they had been seen ascending, Bothwell, with his
rearguard and prisoners, had united himself, or nearly so, with the main
body led by his commander.The extreme difficulty of the road, which was
in some places steep, and in others boggy, retarded the progress of the
column, especially in the rear; for the passage of the main body, in many
instances, poached up the swamps through which they passed, and rendered
them so deep, that the last of their followers were forced to leave the
beaten path, and find safer passage where they could.On these occasions, the distresses of the Reverend Gabriel Kettledrummle
and of Mause Headrigg, were considerably augmented, as the brutal
troopers, by whom they were guarded, compelled them, at all risks which
such inexperienced riders were likely to incur, to leap their horses over
drains and gullies, or to push them through morasses and swamps."Through the help of the Lord I have luppen ower a wall," cried poor
Mause, as her horse was, by her rude attendants, brought up to leap the
turf enclosure of a deserted fold, in which feat her curch flew off,
leaving her grey hairs uncovered."I am sunk in deep mire where there is no standing--I am come into deep
waters where the floods overflow me," exclaimed Kettledrummle, as the
charger on which he was mounted plunged up to the saddle-girths in a
well-head, as the springs are called which supply the marshes, the sable
streams beneath spouting over the face and person of the captive
preacher.These exclamations excited shouts of laughter among their military
attendants; but events soon occurred which rendered them all sufficiently
serious.The leading files of the regiment had nearly attained the brow of the
steep hill we have mentioned, when two or three horsemen, speedily
discovered to be a part of their own advanced guard, who had acted as a
patrol, appeared returning at full gallop, their horses much blown, and
the men apparently in a disordered flight.They were followed upon the
spur by five or six riders, well armed with sword and pistol, who halted
upon the top of the hill, on observing the approach of the Life-Guards.One or two who had carabines dismounted, and, taking a leisurely and
deliberate aim at the foremost rank of the regiment, discharged their
pieces, by which two troopers were wounded, one severely.They then
mounted their horses, and disappeared over the ridge of the hill,
retreating with so much coolness as evidently showed, that, on the one
hand, they were undismayed by the approach of so considerable a force as
was moving against them, and conscious, on the other, that they were
supported by numbers sufficient for their protection.This incident
occasioned a halt through the whole body of cavalry; and while
Claverhouse himself received the report of his advanced guard, which had
been thus driven back upon the main body, Lord Evandale advanced to the
top of the ridge over which the enemy's horsemen had retired, and Major
Allan, Cornet Grahame, and the other officers, employed themselves in
extricating the regiment from the broken ground, and drawing them up on
the side of the hill in two lines, the one to support the other.The word was then given to advance; and in a few minutes the first lines
stood on the brow and commanded the prospect on the other side.The
second line closed upon them, and also the rear-guard with the prisoners;
so that Morton and his companions in captivity could, in like manner, see
the form of opposition which was now offered to the farther progress of
their captors.The brow of the hill, on which the royal Life-Guards were now drawn up,
sloped downwards (on the side opposite to that which they had ascended)
with a gentle declivity, for more than a quarter of a mile, and presented
ground, which, though unequal in some places, was not altogether
unfavourable for the manoeuvres of cavalry, until near the bottom, when
the <DW72> terminated in a marshy level, traversed through its whole
length by what seemed either a natural gully, or a deep artificial drain,
the sides of which were broken by springs, trenches filled with water,
out of which peats and turf had been dug, and here and there by some
straggling thickets of alders which loved the moistness so well, that
they continued to live as bushes, although too much dwarfed by the sour
soil and the stagnant bog-water to ascend into trees.Beyond this ditch,
or gully, the ground arose into a second heathy swell, or rather hill,
near to the foot of which, and' as if with the object of defending the
broken ground and ditch that covered their front, the body of insurgents
appeared to be drawn up with the purpose of abiding battle.The first, tolerably
provided with fire-arms, were advanced almost close to the verge of the
bog, so that their fire must necessarily annoy the royal cavalry as they
descended the opposite hill, the whole front of which was exposed, and
would probably be yet more fatal if they attempted to cross the morass.Behind this first line was a body of pikemen, designed for their support
in case the dragoons should force the passage of the marsh.In their rear
was their third line, consisting of countrymen armed with scythes set
straight on poles, hay-forks, spits, clubs, goads, fish-spears, and such
other rustic implements as hasty resentment had converted into
instruments of war.On each flank of the infantry, but a little backward
from the bog, as if to allow themselves dry and sound ground whereon to
act in case their enemies should force the pass, there was drawn up a
small body of cavalry, who were, in general, but indifferently armed, and
worse mounted, but full of zeal for the cause, being chiefly either
landholders of small property, or farmers of the better class, whose
means enabled them to serve on horseback.A few of those who had been
engaed in driving back the advanced guard of the royalists, might now be
seen returning slowly towards their own squadrons.These were the only
individuals of the insurgent army which seemed to be in motion.All the
others stood firm and motionless, as the grey stones that lay scattered
on the heath around them.The total number of the insurgents might amount to about a thousand men;
but of these there were scarce a hundred cavalry, nor were the half of
them even tolerably armed.The strength of their position, however, the
sense of their having taken a desperate step, the superiority of their
numbers, but, above all, the ardour of their enthusiasm, were the means
on which their leaders reckoned, for supplying the want of arms,
equipage, and military discipline.On the side of the hill that rose above the array of battle which they
had adopted, were seen the women and even the children, whom zeal,
opposed to persecution, had driven into the wilderness.They seemed
stationed there to be spectators of the engagement, by which their own
fate, as well as that of their parents, husbands, and sons, was to be
decided.Like the females of the ancient German tribes, the shrill cries
which they raised, when they beheld the glittering ranks of their enemy
appear on the brow of the opposing eminence, acted as an incentive to
their relatives to fight to the last in defence of that which was dearest
to them.Such exhortations seemed to have their full and emphatic effect;
for a wild halloo, which went from rank to rank on the appearance of the
soldiers, intimated the resolution of the insurgents to fight to the
uttermost.As the horsemen halted their lines on the ridge of the hill, their
trumpets and kettle-drums sounded a bold and warlike flourish of menace
and defiance, that rang along the waste like the shrill summons of a
destroying angel.The wanderers, in answer, united their voices, and sent
forth, in solemn modulation, the two first verses of the seventy-sixth
Psalm, according to the metrical version of the Scottish Kirk:

                    "In Judah's land God is well known,
                    His name's in Israel great:
                    In Salem is his tabernacle,
                    In Zion is his seat.There arrows of the bow he brake,
                    The shield, the sword, the war.More glorious thou than hills of prey,
                    More excellent art far."A shout, or rather a solemn acclamation, attended the close of the
stanza; and after a dead pause, the second verse was resumed by the
insurgents, who applied the destruction of the Assyrians as prophetical
of the issue of their own impending contest:--

               "Those that were stout of heart are spoil'd,
               They slept their sleep outright;
               And none of those their hands did find,
               That were the men of might.When thy rebuke, O Jacob's God,
               Had forth against them past,
               Their horses and their chariots both
               Were in a deep sleep cast."There was another acclamation, which was followed by the most profound
silence.While these solemn sounds, accented by a thousand voices, were prolonged
amongst the waste hills, Claverhouse looked with great attention on the
ground, and on the order of battle which the wanderers had adopted, and
in which they determined to await the assault."The churls," he said, "must have some old soldiers with them; it was no
rustic that made choice of that ground.""Burley is said to be with them for certain," answered Lord Evandale,
"and also Hackston of Rathillet, Paton of Meadowhead, Cleland, and some
other men of military skill.""I judged as much," said Claverhouse, "from the style in which these
detached horsemen leapt their horses over the ditch, as they returned to
their position.It was easy to see that there were a few roundheaded
troopers amongst them, the true spawn of the old Covenant.We must manage
this matter warily as well as boldly.Evandale, let the officers come to
this knoll."He moved to a small moss-grown cairn, probably the resting-place of some
Celtic chief of other times, and the call of "Officers to the front,"
soon brought them around their commander."I do not call you around me, gentlemen," said Claverhouse, "in the
formal capacity of a council of war, for I will never turn over on others
the responsibility which my rank imposes on myself.I only want the
benefit of your opinions, reserving to myself, as most men do when they
ask advice, the liberty of following my own.--What say you, Cornet
Grahame?Shall we attack these fellows who are bellowing younder?You are
youngest and hottest, and therefore will speak first whether I will or
no.""Then," said Cornet Grahame, "while I have the honour to carry the
standard of the Life-Guards, it shall never, with my will, retreat before
rebels.I say, charge, in God's name and the King's!"continued Claverhouse, "for Evandale is so
modest, we shall never get him to speak till you have said what you have
to say.""These fellows," said Major Allan, an old cavalier officer of experience,
"are three or four to one--I should not mind that much upon a fair field,
but they are posted in a very formidable strength, and show no
inclination to quit it.I therefore think, with deference to Cornet
Grahame's opinion, that we should draw back to Tillietudlem, occupy the
pass between the hills and the open country, and send for reinforcements
to my Lord Ross, who is lying at Glasgow with a regiment of infantry.In
this way we should cut them off from the Strath of Clyde, and either
compel them to come out of their stronghold, and give us battle on fair
terms, or, if they remain here, we will attack them so soon as our
infantry has joined us, and enabled us to act with effect among these
ditches, bogs, and quagmires."said the young Cornet, "what signifies strong ground, when it is
only held by a crew of canting, psalm-singing old women?""A man may fight never the worse," retorted Major Allan, "for honouring
both his Bible and Psalter.These fellows will prove as stubborn as
steel; I know them of old.""Their nasal psalmody," said the Cornet, "reminds our Major of the race
of Dunbar.""Had you been at that race, young man," retorted Allan, "you would have
wanted nothing to remind you of it for the longest day you have to live.""Hush, hush, gentlemen," said Claverhouse, "these are untimely
repartees.--I should like your advice well, Major Allan, had our rascally
patrols (whom I will see duly punished) brought us timely notice of the
enemy's numbers and position.But having once presented ourselves before
them in line, the retreat of the Life-Guards would argue gross timidity,
and be the general signal for insurrection throughout the west.In which
case, so far from obtaining any assistance from my Lord Ross, I promise
you I should have great apprehensions of his being cut off before we can
join him, or he us.A retreat would have quite the same fatal effect upon
the king's cause as the loss of a battle--and as to the difference of
risk or of safety it might make with respect to ourselves, that, I am
sure, no gentleman thinks a moment about.There must be some gorges or
passes in the morass through which we can force our way; and, were we
once on firm ground, I trust there is no man in the Life-Guards who
supposes our squadrons, though so weak in numbers, are unable to trample
into dust twice the number of these unpractised clowns.--What say you, my
Lord Evandale?""I humbly think," said Lord Evandale, "that, go the day how it will, it
must be a bloody one; and that we shall lose many brave fellows, and
probably be obliged to slaughter a great number of these misguided men,
who, after all, are Scotchmen and subjects of King Charles as well as we
are."and undeserving the name either of Scotchmen or of
subjects," said Claverhouse; "but come, my lord, what does your opinion
point at?""To enter into a treaty with these ignorant and misled men," said the
young nobleman.Never while I
live," answered his commander."At least send a trumpet and flag of truce, summoning them to lay down
their weapons and disperse," said Lord Evandale, "upon promise of a free
pardon--I have always heard, that had that been done before the battle of
Pentland hills, much blood might have been saved.""Well," said Claverhouse, "and who the devil do you think would carry a
summons to these headstrong and desperate fanatics?Their leaders, who have been all most active in the murder
of the Archbishop of St Andrews, fight with a rope round their necks, and
are likely to kill the messenger, were it but to dip their followers in
loyal blood, and to make them as desperate of pardon as themselves.""I will go myself," said Evandale, "if you will permit me.I have often
risked my blood to spill that of others, let me do so now in order to
save human lives.""You shall not go on such an errand, my lord," said Claverhouse; "your
rank and situation render your safety of too much consequence to the
country in an age when good principles are so rare.--Here's my brother's
son Dick Grahame, who fears shot or steel as little as if the devil had
given him armour of proof against it, as the fanatics say he has given to
his uncle.[Note:  Cornet Grahame.There was actually a young cornet of the
     Life-Guards named Grahame, and probably some relation of
     Claverhouse, slain in the skirmish of Drumclog.In the old ballad on
     the Battle of Bothwell Bridge, Claverhouse is said to have continued
     the slaughter of the fugitives in revenge of this gentleman's death."Haud up your hand," then Monmouth said; "Gie quarters to these men
     for me;" But bloody Claver'se swore an oath, His kinsman's death
     avenged should be.The body of this young man was found shockingly mangled after the
     battle, his eyes pulled out, and his features so much defaced, that
     it was impossible to recognise him.The Tory writers say that this
     was done by the Whigs; because, finding the name Grahame wrought in
     the young gentleman's neckcloth, they took the corpse for that of
     Claver'se himself.The Whig authorities give a different account,
     from tradition, of the cause of Cornet Grahame's body being thus
     mangled.He had, say they, refused his own dog any food on the
     morning of the battle, affirming, with an oath, that he should have
     no breakfast but upon the flesh of the Whigs.The ravenous animal,
     it is said, flew at his master as soon as he fell, and lacerated his
     face and throat.These two stories are presented to the reader, leaving it to him to
     judge whether it is most likely that a party of persecuted and
     insurgent fanatics should mangle a body supposed to be that of their
     chief enemy, in the same manner as several persons present at
     Drumclog had shortly before treated the person of Archbishop Sharpe;
     or that a domestic dog should, for want of a single breakfast,
     become so ferocious as to feed on his own master, selecting his body
     from scores that were lying around, equally accessible to his
     ravenous appetite.]He shall take a flag of truce and a trumpet, and ride down to the edge of
the morass to summon them to lay down their arms and disperse.""With all my soul, Colonel," answered the Cornet; "and I'll tie my cravat
on a pike to serve for a white flag--the rascals never saw such a pennon
of Flanders lace in their lives before.""Colonel Grahame," said Evandale, while the young officer prepared for
his expedition, "this young gentleman is your nephew and your apparent
heir; for God's sake, permit me to go.It was my counsel, and I ought to
stand the risk.""Were he my only son," said Claverhouse, "this is no cause and no time to
spare him.I hope my private affections will never interfere with my
public duty.If Dick Grahame falls, the loss is chiefly mine; were your
lordship to die, the King and country would be the sufferers.--Come,
gentlemen, each to his post.If our summons is unfavourably received, we
will instantly attack; and, as the old Scottish blazon has it, God shaw
the right!"With many a stout thwack and many a bang,
               Hard crab-tree and old iron rang.Cornet Richard Grahame descended the hill, bearing in his hand the
extempore flag of truce, and making his managed horse keep time by bounds
and curvets to the tune which he whistled.Five
or six horsemen, having something the appearance of officers, detached
themselves from each flank of the Presbyterian army, and, meeting in the
centre, approached the ditch which divided the hollow as near as the
morass would permit.Towards this group, but keeping the opposite side of
the swamp, Cornet Grahame directed his horse, his motions being now the
conspicuous object of attention to both armies; and, without
disparagement to the courage of either, it is probable there was a
general wish on both sides that this embassy might save the risks and
bloodshed of the impending conflict.When he had arrived right opposite to those, who, by their advancing to
receive his message, seemed to take upon themselves as the leaders of the
enemy, Cornet Grahame commanded his trumpeter to sound a parley.The
insurgents having no instrument of martial music wherewith to make the
appropriate reply, one of their number called out with a loud, strong
voice, demanding to know why he approached their leaguer."To summon you in the King's name, and in that of Colonel John Grahame of
Claverhouse, specially commissioned by the right honourable Privy Council
of Scotland," answered the Cornet, "to lay down your arms, and dismiss
the followers whom ye have led into rebellion, contrary to the laws of
God, of the King, and of the country.""Return to them that sent thee," said the insurgent leader, "and tell
them that we are this day in arms for a broken Covenant and a persecuted
Kirk; tell them that we renounce the licentious and perjured Charles
Stewart, whom you call king, even as he renounced the Covenant, after
having once and again sworn to prosecute to the utmost of his power all
the ends thereof, really, constantly, and sincerely, all the days of his
life, having no enemies but the enemies of the Covenant, and no friends
but its friends.Whereas, far from keeping the oath he had called God and
angels to witness, his first step, after his incoming into these
kingdoms, was the fearful grasping at the prerogative of the Almighty, by
that hideous Act of Supremacy, together with his expulsing, without
summons, libel, or process of law, hundreds of famous faithful preachers,
thereby wringing the bread of life out of the mouth of hungry, poor
creatures, and forcibly cramming their throats with the lifeless,
saltless, foisonless, lukewarm drammock of the fourteen false prelates,
and their sycophantic, formal, carnal, scandalous creature-curates.""I did not come to hear you preach," answered the officer, "but to know,
in one word, if you will disperse yourselves, on condition of a free
pardon to all but the murderers of the late Archbishop of St Andrews; or
whether you will abide the attack of his majesty's forces, which will
instantly advance upon you.""In one word, then," answered the spokesman, "we are here with our swords
on our thighs, as men that watch in the night.We will take one part and
portion together, as brethren in righteousness.Whosoever assails us in
our good cause, his blood be on his own head.So return to them that sent
thee, and God give them and thee a sight of the evil of your ways!""Is not your name," said the Cornet, who began to recollect having seen
the person whom he was now speaking with, "John Balfour of Burley?""And if it be," said the spokesman, "hast thou aught to say against it?""Only," said the Cornet, "that, as you are excluded from pardon in the
name of the King and of my commanding officer, it is to these country
people, and not to you, that I offer it; and it is not with you, or such
as you, that I am sent to treat.""Thou art a young soldier, friend," said Burley, "and scant well learned
in thy trade, or thou wouldst know that the bearer of a flag of truce
cannot treat with the army but through their officers; and that if he
presume to do otherwise, he forfeits his safe conduct."While speaking these words, Burley unslung his carabine, and held it in
readiness."I am not to be intimidated from the discharge of my duty by the menaces
of a murderer," said Cornet Grahame.--"Hear me, good people; I proclaim,
in the name of the King and of my commanding officer, full and free
pardon to all, excepting"--

"I give thee fair warning," said Burley, presenting his piece."A free pardon to all," continued the young officer, still addressing the
body of the insurgents--"to all but"--

"Then the Lord grant grace to thy soul--amen!"With these words he fired, and Cornet Richard Grahame dropped from his
horse.The unfortunate young gentleman had only
strength to turn himself on the ground and mutter forth, "My poor
mother!"His startled horse fled
back to the regiment at the gallop, as did his scarce less affrighted
attendant.said one of Balfour's brother officers."My duty," said Balfour, firmly."Is it not written, Thou shalt be
zealous even to slaying?Let those, who dare, now venture to speak of
truce or pardon!"He turned his eye on Evandale, while a
transitory glance of indescribable emotion disturbed, for a second's
space, the serenity of his features, and briefly said, "You see the
event.""I will avenge him, or die!"exclaimed Evandale; and, putting his horse
into motion, rode furiously down the hill, followed by his own troop, and
that of the deceased Cornet, which broke down without orders; and, each
striving to be the foremost to revenge their young officer, their ranks
soon fell into confusion.These forces formed the first line of the
royalists.It was in vain that Claverhouse exclaimed, "Halt!It was all that he could accomplish, by galloping
along the second line, entreating, commanding, and even menacing the men
with his sword, that he could restrain them from following an example so
contagious."Allan," he said, as soon as he had rendered the men in some degree more
steady, "lead them slowly down the hill to support Lord Evandale, who is
about to need it very much.--Bothwell, thou art a cool and a daring
fellow"--

"Ay," muttered Bothwell, "you can remember that in a moment like this.""Lead ten file up the hollow to the right," continued his commanding
officer, "and try every means to get through the bog; then form and
charge the rebels in flank and rear, while they are engaged with us in
front."Bothwell made a signal of intelligence and obedience, and moved off with
his party at a rapid pace.Meantime, the disaster which Claverhouse had apprehended, did not fail to
take place.The troopers, who, with Lord Evandale, had rushed down upon
the enemy, soon found their disorderly career interrupted by the
impracticable character of the ground.Some stuck fast in the morass as
they attempted to struggle through, some recoiled from the attempt and
remained on the brink, others dispersed to seek a more favourable place
to pass the swamp.In the midst of this confusion, the first line of the
enemy, of which the foremost rank knelt, the second stooped, and the
third stood upright, poured in a close and destructive fire that emptied
at least a score of saddles, and increased tenfold the disorder into
which the horsemen had fallen.Lord Evandale, in the meantime, at the
head of a very few well-mounted men, had been able to clear the ditch,
but was no sooner across than he was charged by the left body of the
enemy's cavalry, who, encouraged by the small number of opponents that
had made their way through the broken ground, set upon them with the
utmost fury, crying, "Woe, woe to the uncircumcised Philistines!down
with Dagon and all his adherents!"The young nobleman fought like a lion; but most of his followers were
killed, and he himself could not have escaped the same fate but for a
heavy fire of carabines, which Claverhouse, who had now advanced with the
second line near to the ditch, poured so effectually upon the enemy, that
both horse and foot for a moment began to shrink,
